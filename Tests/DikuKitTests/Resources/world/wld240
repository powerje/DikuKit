{W}The Ninth Wicket{w}~

   You stand at the final wicket.  To your east lies the
   luxurious castle of the King and Queen of Hearts.
   Your spine tingles just thinking of the enormous
   riches the castle must hold.  Looking up, you notice a
   balcony on the second floor of the castle.  Standing
   on it is the regal figure of the Queen of Hearts.  She
   seems to be shouting something at you that sounds
   like, "Off with their heads". So you think, "Well, its
   gonna be mine or hers".  BANZAI!!!!

{W}Before The Croquette Field{w}~

   You stand before the croquette field.  Strewn across
   the field you see a number of playing cards bent over
   in an attempt to emulate a croquette wicket.  It
   appears that if you are to continue upon your travels,
   then you must traverse this field.

   There is an important looking sign here.

{G}Perched On A {BO,G}Branch{bo,g}~

   The limb that you stand on is rather small for your
   great mass.  It trembles under your weight, yet with
   proper balancing skills, you could manage to stay on
   it for another 10 seconds or so.  Below to the south,
   you see a playing field of some sort.  Beyond that and
   to the east is a lovely alabaster castle.  To your
   west, you notice the limb is withered and decayed. 
   Only the foolhardy would venture forth onto that
   branch, for it surely brings death. 

   Perched on the limb, you see a slumbering orange and
   white ringed cat. As you approach, it rises from it's
   nap, yawns and stretches, and then twith a wink, it
   slowly fades away, leaving only a huge grinning smile
   hovering above the tree limb.

   The scent of the beast is becoming stronger.  For the
   first time in your adventures, you feel fear.  Looking
   at the destruction to the terrain around you, you know
   that the creature up ahead is truly one that will test
   your mettle.

{R}End {W}Of {BO,C}The Road{bo,c}~

   You seem to have come to the end of the path.  It
   leads east to a hedge and then just stops.  To the
   south you see a devastated field.  It appears as
   though a heard of elephants has spent the last ten
   years stampeding over the pasture.  In the distance,
   you can hear a horrendous bellowing which leaves you
   quaking in your boots.

   This is the far end of the table.  If possible, it
   seems even more cluttered than the near end.  The Mad

   This is the near end of a large picnic table.  It is
   cluttered with sopping wet cakes, broken dishes, and
   large amounts of spirited tea.  Curled up in a cup,
   you spy a tiny sleeping door mouse.  Best just to
   leave it alone.  Parading about the mouse, splashing
   tea around and just being generally loopy, you note a
   piss drunk hare.

{BO,B}Emerging From The Smoke{bo,b}~

   What a trip!!  Maybe you should stay off that stuff
   for a while.  Anywhoo, now that the smoke has cleared
   you can see where you are.  Golly but what a strange
   place you have landed yourself in.  Lavender skies,
   blue grass, the sounds of dogs chirping, your buddy
   smells like dental floss.

   Oh well, better see what there is to kill.  After all,
   you are mudding and the purpose of mudding is to kill
   stuff.  So follow that path that stretches out in
   front of you and enjoy the bloodshed.

{BO,G}On Top Of The Giant {bo,G}M{BO,G}u{bo,G}s{BO,G}h{bo,G}r{BO,G}o{bo,G}o{BO,G}m{bo,g}~

   You are standing on top of the giant mushroom.  The
   field opens up in front of you in all directions with
   no apparent boundaries.

   An enormous hookah sits embedded in the cap of the
   mushroom.  You follow the hookah's hose up up up to
   find a big green caterpillar on the other end of it.
   The caterpillar blows a smoke ring, tilts it's red fez
   in your direction and offers the hose for your
   enjoyment.

   PLOP!  After what seems like an eternity, you land on
   some sort of spongy ground.  Looking around, you are
   greeted by strange sights.  You are in a circular room
   whose only contents is a large wooden table residing
   in the middle of this place.

   On the table top, you see the shards of some crystal
   vials.  It appears someone has beaten you to whatever
   they were.

   To your east,  you see a tiny door about a foot high. 
   If you take off all your armor, crouch down, turn
   sidewise, and roll diagonally, just maybe you could
   make it through.

   You scramble through the brush to find yourself in a
   tiny clearing.  The sun breaks through the boughs of
   the trees to illuminate a singularly large oak
   standing in the middle of the field.  At it's base is
   a hole big enough to drive a car through, if you knew
   what a car was.

   And there he is, the object of your torment.  You
   wield your weapon and with a fire in your eye, run
   screaming towards the rabbit.  But alas, it leaps into
   the hole and disappears from sight.  What else is
   there to do.  You hang your head in defeat and prepare

{BO,G}A Peaceful Picnic Setting{bo,g}~

   Crashing through the forest, you are pleasantly surprised
   by the sight that greets you.  A field of long soft
   grass, a little babbling brook ...  It is simply too
   much. Your senses are overwhelmed, you scramble to unpack
   your picnic basket and dig in.  Just as you are about to
   set in to your repast, a rustle in the grass catches your
   eye.  Focusing on the source, you stare in disbelief.  

   It's a fookin' rabbit.  A FOUR FOOT TALL rabbit,
   outfitted in what appears to be a silk vest.  He pulls a
   pocket watch from the vest pocket, quickly examines it,
   and declares loudly, "Oh Dear, Oh Dear, I'm late".  

   Are you in a story book or what.  Well, no matter.  An
   abomination like this should not be allowed to live.  The
   bloodlust wells up in your throat.  You brandish your
   sword and advance on this creature.  Just as you near
   close enough to make the killing stroke, the rabbit turns
   on it heels and hops away.
