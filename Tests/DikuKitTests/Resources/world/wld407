    You have made it very far in this dangerous land.  It takes
    very dedicated players to make it this far.  Now only a few
    rooms left and then you'll be able to claim you beat Super
    Mario World.

    The final fortress in this land lies here blocking your
    way to the secret backdoor entrance of Bowser's Castle.
    The ranzor's here are even more vicious than the ones
    before.  It might be a good idea just to avoid ranzors
    and go through Larry's Castle.

    The final ghost house of Mario land lies here.  Only

    seems to be guarding the entrance to Bowser's Castle.
    You figure it has to be the Castle of Larry.

    Somehow there's lava pit in the middle of this cave
    and you can feel the heat it's generating.  You can
    barely stand the little bits of lava hitting your
    skin as you try to make it to the end of the cave.
