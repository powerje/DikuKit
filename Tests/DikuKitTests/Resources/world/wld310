{BO}{BLU}Before the Gates{blu}~
   
  The heavy gates rest open, welcoming all those who wish to master the

{BO}{BLU}Inside the Gates{blu}~
   
  As you pass through the gates a broad warrior shoves you to the side 
and promptly exits.  AHH!  You would love to kick in that guy's face, 
but you know better than to try it without any training.  Luckily, your 
fall is broken by a large wooden table.  Upon the table is a stack of 
manuals which all new trainees must study and master. Be sure to pick 
up one for yourself.
   
  As you survey the open courtyard you see several new trainees resting
next to a large dragonfountain.  An elder mage is lecturing them on the 
different channels in which one's magic can be drawn.
  You can continue onward by going north.  Type: 'n'.

catch a few words of wisdom for the day.  The dragonfountain is just

   This mystical realm was first conceived in a dream.  One
   day, an ancient protess fell into a deep sleep.  Her sleep
   was the image of a world borne in chaos.  Colours and shapes
   twisted and turned, experimenting with the geometry of life.
   Becoming increasingly concerned of her condition, the protess's
   lover tried to wake his sleeping bride.  Instead of bringing
   the protess to her senses, the lover had accidentally plunged
   her into her own dream.  She was at the mercy of her mind as 
   she screamed in terror...

A large, hideous severed dragon's head is mounted on the door.
  Seems like you've stumbled upon the Academy of the Dragon.

{bo,W}A Mysterious Hallway{bo}~
   
   The stone walls here are covered with portraits of ancient warriors.  
The dirt tunnel floor is covered with a dark red carpet.  Candleholders
protrude from the walls between each picture, holding nearly burnt-out
candles.  The flickering candle light gives the portraits frightening
lifelike qualities.  Farther to the south you hear the sounds of what
seems to be a discussion.

{BO,BLA}A Dark Tunnel{bo}~
   
   Your eyes begin to adjust to the darkness as you stumble along
through the tunnel.  Light flickers from the far south, casting 
eerie, distorted shadows on the cold stone walls.  From the south
you can also here noises, though you can't decipher their meanings.

{BO,BLA}A Dark Tunnel{bo}~
   
   The light quickly fades away to the west as you journey onward 
through the tunnels.  The tunnel continues to the east and becomes 
much darker.  The scent of sweat is strong in the tunnel.  There
must be some sort of animal living down here.

{BO,BLA}A Damp Tunnel{bo}~
   
   Your shoes fill with water as you wander blindly through the dark
tunnel.  The air is very moist and you can feel your clothing getting
drenched as it clings to your skin.  The light from behind you fades
quickly as you continue onward.

{BOLD,BLACK}Labyrinth Under the Battlegrounds{b}~
   
   You find yourself in a dark and damp place under the battlegrounds.
The stone walls which surround you lead in all four directions.  As you walk
around, your foot steps echo down the corridors.  Above you, you can hear the
screams of combatants in the battlegrounds die in agony, you might end up
like them if you aren't careful.

{BOLD,BLACK} Mage's Laboratory{b}~
Shelves filled with dirty jars, books, candles, and other assorted
things you would find in a mage's laboratory line the walls. In the middle
of a room standing before a group of students is a golden skinned mage, 
dressed in the black robes of sorcery. On the floor beneath the mage, 
etched in sand are arcane runes for some magical spell that he is teaching
his students.

{BOLD,BLACK}A Small Room{b}~
         You enter a cluttered room that has furniture,  clothing, weapons, 
and other things tossed about. In the corner of the room a small guy in rags
is blending in with the shadows. Could this be the training room for the 
ancient art of Thievery? I would keep an eye on my gold coins and eq...
