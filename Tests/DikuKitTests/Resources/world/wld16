{BO,BLA}An old path.{bo}~
  {WH}This path, if you can call it a path, is over overgrown with {BO,GR}weeds,{bo,WH}
but for some reason you feel at peace here. To the north you see an old
gate.

{BO,BLA}In the Grave{bo}~
{BO,WH}As you come through the headstone it closes and disappears.
You now find yourself in a room about 6 feet deep, 4 feet wide,
and 8 feet long. You seem to be standing on a {BLA}long black box, {WH}in fact it's 
a coffin, and its occupant does not like {CY}Visitors !!{bo}

the walls are covered in fine silken drapes. This room looks very well 
kept, except for a {RE}large crack in the floor {CY}which seems to have been
patched.
 
You notice that undead corpses seem to form two lines here, one going {BO,WH}up
a pure white staircase {bo,CY}and the other leading {BO,RE}north into flames.
