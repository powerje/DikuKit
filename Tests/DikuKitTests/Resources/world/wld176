   Hi, and welcome to Krandon's Pointe.  This zone is intended for
   high advanced groups of 3-6 people (what zone isn't).  I strongly
   advise you to have that many people as you try your hand with this
   zone.  If you choose to ignore me, go at your own risk!

   A slight pitch of the feet could send you hurtling to an icy death

   {BO}{C}in his hunt for the Moldoonese.  C{B}hichini tracked down all of the poor
   {C}villagers and telekinetically{B} froze them all until his master, Krandon
   {C}arrived.  Krandon decimat{B}ed them all with a glint of his samurai sword. 
   {C}A lone warrior know{B}n as Bransam found the strength and courage to fight
   {C}Krandon and prot{B}ect the helpless villagers.  With the aid of his trainers,
   {C}he had mastere{B}d the art of RIPHEARTING and showed his strength in a 
   {C}gruesome disp{B}lay of power. 
   {C}
   {C}The samur{B}ai gods, seeing his awesome power, became afraid and stole it
   {C}for thei{B}r own use.  Bransam fled into this cove where he allegedly jumped
   {C}to hi{B}s death, fearing a skill of his own creation.  His spirit continues

{BO}{BLU}The {C}Seas{BLU} of {R}Bransam{r}~

   The violent Seas of Bransam as it came to be called, were the cause
   of a legendary warrior's icy death.  He allegedly jumped into these 
   waters to flee from the wrath of his own creation.  His spirit has come
   to hover over these waters in mourning of his brief life.  He has come
   here today to punish all who wish to harm his people or his place.

{BOLD}{BLACK}The End of Time{bold}{black}~
{CYAN}
   The roads you have traveled end here.  In the barren world at the end of 
   time.  You have followed Elric here to the culmination of his destiny, 
   when he blows the horn of fate and the universe is re-created, erasing all 
   that has come before.  The war between Law and Chaos forever ending in 
   a stalemate.

   Elric, the last emperor of Melnibone, stands here and regards you with 
   brooding, melancholy eyes.  He knows what it means, what he must do.  
   His chalk white albino skin is covered slightly with the dust of this 
   nowhere, and his crimson eyes flash with evil as the mighty runeblade 
   Stormbringer lunges at your throat of its own accord.

{BO}{R}Market Square of Death{r}~
 {bo}{W}
  You are standing on the Market Square, the famous 
  Square of Midgaard.  A large, peculiar looking 
  fountain is trickling in the middle of the square. 
  Roads lead in every direction - north to the temple
  square, south to the common square, east and west
  is the main street.                        
  {BO}{R}          
  This square looks peculiar.  It is not like the one
  you have fought battles in as a newbie.  It has a
  different aire about it - more . . . 
                 
                   . . .evil.

   Three small wooden staffs float mystically in the air
   and give an eerie feeling to the room.  You shutter
   as you feel a cold breeze run past your neck.  Noticing
   a small glint of light, you reach your hand towards the
   seemingly impervious wall and it disappears into 
   blackness.

   has taken a backseat here and you feel you can rest here.  
   You can hear screams echoing from the bone walls sending a 
   chilling shiver through your body.  You can't determine whether
   it is your group or some vicious mob which is dying, but will
   you let your curiosity get the best of you?

   The scenery around you reminds you of a blacksmith's shoppe.  You
   see many metalworkers making swords, shields, and armor in 
   preparation for the day's battles.  You determine that this metal

{C}The Trindine {BO}{C}Throne{c}~
  {C}
   A tall shimmering throne stands a{Y}s a symbol of great wealth
   {C}to the King of Trindene.  The tr{Y}oops guard the king with 
   {C}their life as the king rules ov{Y}er them.  His great riches
   {C}are not only shown in the intr{Y}icacy of the throne's 
   {C}engravings, but also in the a{Y}rmor of the troops.  Each 
   {C}suit has a emerald stone pul{Y}sating in the center.
