Base Camp~
After all of the hype and planning, you have finally made it.  But the
scene that greets you is one of shock and dismay.  Hundreds of people
are squished together amidst the trash piles at Base Camp. Rows of 
tents cover up the mountainside and discarded oxygen canisters litter 
the ground.  As you walk over a mound of frozen human waste you wonder 
what you have gotten yourself into.

Mess Tent~
The Mess Tent offers a warm retreat from the frigid expanse of the
Everest Base Camp.   You watch people huddled around the tables
discussing strategies for taking the mountain and realize that some
of them will never make it back here alive.  One of the kitchen help
brings out your dinner.  Tonight's Special: Yak Meat and Sherpa Tea.

The Kitchen~
Huddled over his primitive propane stove, the cook is obviously not
happy you are disturbing him.  A wicked smile lights up his face as
he fixes his eyes on dinner.  Big hint:  He's not looking at the Yak
meat anymore and you're not feeling quite so hungry.

Icy Trail to Camp 1~
Grudgingly, you begin your slow ascent to Camp 1.  The air is beginning
to thin and thoughts of home distract you from the task at hand.  As
you leave the warmth of Base Camp and civilization behind, a cold chill
runs down your spine. The mountain looms in the distance.

Camp 1~
Camp 1 is not quite what you expected... Twenty tents perched close
together on a ledge overlooking the day's hike.  The worst part is,
you're stuck here for three days as you acclimate to the change in
altitude.  Three days of ice, wind and the freezing cold with even
more to come.  To top it off, the Taiwanese team is eyeing your eq.

Biouvac~
After digging in the snow for several minutes, the hatch opens to reveal
a dugout left from a previous expedition.  You see the ladder you were
counting on to cross the Khumbu Icefall propped up against the back wall.
Unfortunately, something else has plans for the ladder, AND YOU!

Khumbu Ice Fall~
The Khumbu Icefall looms before you as a maze of icy crags and deep
crevasses.  The eerie landscape looks as though it was taken from a movie. 
The glimmering ice swallows everything from view, even the peak
itself.  Somebody could get lost in here.  Suddenly, the ice cracks
beneath your feet.  Get moving now!

The Sherpa Tent~
The Sherpas didn't appreciate you killing their friends and two of them
decided to run off with the ropes you need to climb the mountain.
The odds look good on paper- two against your group, but remember that
you are wheezing from carrying your pack in the high altitutdes.  These
sherpas do more before 4 AM then you do all day.

Finally reaching Camp 3, you collapse inside of your tent and try to get
some sleep.  Sadly, two hours of shut-eye doesn't do much after almost
two weeks of hiking in freezing conditions.  Everest looms above you in
the distance, however, and keeps the drive burning inside you. Drive 
or no drive, you better find some oxygen soon or life is gonna get real
difficult real fast.

The Ropes~
Leaving your mutinous crew behind, your group heads for Camp 3.  A scout
runs ahead of the pack, string the ropes out for the safety of the
rest.  A long and arduous task, you begin to wonder what in the hell
motivated you to climb Everest in the first place.

Camp 3~
Finally reaching Camp 3, you collapse inside of your tent and try to get
some sleep.  Sadly, two hours of shut-eye doesn't do much after almost
two weeks of hiking in freezing conditions.  Everest looms above you in
the distance, however, and keeps the drive burning inside you. Drive 
or no drive, you better find some oxygen soon or life is gonna get real
difficult real fast.

Icy Trail to Camp 4~
With every step forward, your ascent is becoming increasingly more
perilous.  As you approach Camp 4 and then what is known as the Death 
Zone, your blood begins to race as you long for a nice, warm fire and a 
good meal.  Oops!   Better watch your step because the trail is 
getting narrow and it is an awful long way down.

Camp 4~
This is the last stop before summitting.  Camp 4.  Possibly the most
isolated place on the planet, Camp 4 is located at 27,000 ft.  Nothing
lives here.  Nothing ever will.  Looking around in awe, not even the
thought of summitting tomorrow afternoon succeeds in blotting the
memories of the many deaths that have occurred here from your mind.  You
better find the Oxygen Stash VERY soon

The Oxygen Stash~
You found the oxygen stash!  These cannisters are quite literally the
key to the rest of your adventure.  Without them, you have no hope of
ascending the mighty summit of Everest.  Hmmm...  Looks like somebody
else came to that realization, too.  The South African team may not
be that well prepared, but their motto is 'Speak Softly and Carry
a Big Ice Axe.'

The Final Ascent~
You are now in what is fondly called the Death Zone.  Drifting in and
out of consciousness, your mind numbed and senses dulled, you are
making a last ditch-effort to reach the peak. There is no turning
back now.  Even the oxygen can only do so much up here.  As traffic
backs up at the south summit, panic seizes the group and your already
clouded judgement slips away.

The Summit of Mt. Everest~
Congratulations!  You have reached the summit.  Two months of freezing
temperatures, sleep deprivation, awful food and sheer exhausion have
finally payed off.  You are standing on top of the world and the view
is undescribable.  Unfortunately for you, you're not alone.

you make it back alive, or will your name be added to the eternally

A Shadowy Figure~
A figure looms ahead in the distance.  Strange, you cannot make out the
face.  As the figure draws closer, you see it is none other than the
leader of the Mountain Madness team, Scott Fischer.  Considered one of
the greatest climbers ever, Fischer disappeared during the same 1996
expedition as New Zealand climber Rob Hall.  For some strange reason, he
doesn't look too happy to still be here.

Khumbu Ice Fall~
The Khumbu Icefall looms before you as a maze of icy crags and deep
crevasses.  The eerie landscape looks as though it was taken from a movie. 
The glimmering ice swallows everything from view, even the peak
itself.  Somebody could get lost in here.  Suddenly, the ice cracks
beneath your feet.  Get moving now!
