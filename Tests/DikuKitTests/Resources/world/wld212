Offramp to {WHITE}Interstate{white} {BLUE}84{blue}.~
  Traveling along {WHITE}Interstate{white} {BLUE}84{blue}.  Small shrubbery grows all around you, but not much vegitation can grow around this harsh region.  Off to the north in the distance you can see mist rolling off Waco lake.  Looking east you can see an outline of an upcoming city.

In front of a blockade.~
  You slowly lift your sweat laiden head to focus your eyes on two {BLACK}ATF{black} agents standing infront of you.  Behind them you find yourself confronted with a 4-foot concrete barracade blocking off the Highway.  The two agents guarding the wall don't seem to pay much attention to you.  Parked off to the side of the road you see a long {BLACK}black{black} car.  Standing on the right side of the car is a telescope.

  This once beautiful limosine looks as though it has been through some sort of war.  Bullet holes a all over the body of the vehile.

You barely manage to sqeeze your arm through the small crack in the window of the limousine.  You press the play button on the tape device and a few words from some man can be heard coming from the device.....
            .....I say read the words of Revelations 4:1 it says...

After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking to me which said, Come hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.

The tape suddenly comes to an end, and you slowly remove your arm from the tight window sill.
