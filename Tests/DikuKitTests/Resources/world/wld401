A Path In The Village of the Troffs~
You are on a well worn path in the small, busy village of the Troffs. The air
is fragrant with the smell of grass and tree's. Its a warm summers day and the
Troff's are out and about. The occasional Troff smiles at you or waves, but you
are left alone by them. The path contines to the north where you can see 
several mud huts.

The Village of the Troff's~
The path is getting a little wider and you are getting bumped occasionally by
Troffs busy transporting farm produce and simple tools to the local market. 
Some Troffs are just sitting down by the side of the road soaking in the sun. 
It looks good to be a Troff. To the east is a mud house with a large white 
square above the door. To the west is a slightly larger house with a slightly 
larger yellow square. The path also continues to the north and the south.

The Village of the Troff's~
You're standing on the dirt path with the bustle of Troff's all around you.
In the distance to the north you can see some fields. But you're a bit to far
away to see exactly what's going on in them. To the east is a mud house with
a green square on the front of it. To the west is a mud house with a blue 
square on it. You feel pretty sure these different colours you've been seeing 
have something to do with how tough the clan that lives in these houses are.
The dirt path continues to the north and south.

The Village of the Troff's near the Fields~
Here the path takes a turn to the east. To the north and west you can see 
wide open fields. You think you can make out some odd creatures in the 
distance, but you're a bit too far away. Looking south you can see the path 
continue, and you can make out two mud houses.

The Village of the Troff's~
To your north is a rather large mud house with a large red square attached
to the front. The house looks a bit more ornate and you can see a few 
practice swords leaning up against the wall. The path continues to the east 
and west. In The far east you can see two more large, ornate mud houses. 
The path is not nearly so busy and you start to feel a touch nervous.

The Village of the Troff's~
To your south is an ornate mud house. It is festooned with brown banners
and has a large brown square placed above the door. You can see Troff's 
outside practicing with live blades and moving very skillfully. You're 
just about positive they're not farmers. To the east is a massive mud hut 
painted black. There is no ornamentation and nobody is outside. The small 
path leading to the house is clean and narrow. You notice how the Troff's 
practicing infront of the the brown house are careful not to get too close
to the black house.

Entry Hall of the White Clan's House~
You enter a small hall in this modest mud brick home. Around the walls are
assorted farming implements. They look well used and well
maintained. The floor is dirt and well worn and sun streams in through
the windows. This is a comfortable place for the White Troff's.
