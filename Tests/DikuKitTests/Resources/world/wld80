You are in the wizard's room.  He has all kinds of alchemy
equipment as well as spell components.  The wizard, who is
hard at work on crafting spells, does not appear pleased
at this interruption.  He waves his hand in a strange
gesture and smoke fills, the room.  Upon the clearing of
the smoke, you see his "pets".

home.  He has several computers set up, along with a TV, VCR, and several
entertainment systems.  But most of the time, he doesn't get to play with
any of these "TOYS", since he is spending time with his girlfriend.

cloud you can hear the faint sounds of Midgaard. Right before you to the

The Southern end of the hall~
You are standing in a vast hall that is dimly lit, but wherefrom the
light comes, is a mystery. The walls seem to radiate warmth and give
the pleasent feeling of being welcome here. A large portrait is hanging
on one of the walls. A large wooden staircase leads up into the tower.
To the east there is a high passage away from the hall. This ends
shortly after by a tall oak door. The enormous hall extends further
north from here. To the south you can see a huge, and VERY heavy-
looking iron-wrought door. It looks like this is the only exit from
this magnificent old house.

The Northern end of the hall~
You are standing in the northern end of the huge hall. This part is under
the grand wooden staircase so the light seems a little less bright here,
but this doesn't bother your sight at all. To the north lies the kitchen.
To the south lies the Southern end of the hall. To the east there is a huge
metal door. To the west there is a large aspenwood door.

terrible stench and into your mind : "Monsters", you feel BAD about opening
that door.

The Chain where it's too windy~
    Hanging on to the chain you figure out that there's no way down from
here.  The wind pulls you from left to right and back and forth. This seems
like a totally impossible task. The ascent is the only way for you to go.
Otherwise you would risk death by falling to the hard ground below. DO NOT
DESCEND NOW OR YOU'LL SURELY DIE!!!!

    You are approximately at the middle of the treacherous Chain. One false
step and death will come and collect your soul. The chain leads upwards and
downwards.

Besides it could cost you your life, look down and you'll see why.

The Chain~
    As you ascend, the chain seems to absorb all weather around it, making
it swing less even though powerful winds surrounds you. The Chain seems
to chuckle quietly, and as you ascend further, you hear a soft whisper
originating from within the Chain *ITSELF*. 
    It says, " Welcome back another time, stranger. Your company is always
               ... hmmm ... interesting. God Speed. "
    The chain extends further up through the now spreading clouds.

Greater God, Naris.  The chain beneath you seems to evaporate in the
mustering clouds, which seem to be encasing you.
