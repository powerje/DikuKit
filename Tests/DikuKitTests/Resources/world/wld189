   your stats!  To train for your next level, you type 
   the following:

   To improve your STATS, you do the following:
   TRAIN STR (Strength) or TRAIN INT (Intelligence)
   
        Strength             Wisdom
        Intelligence         Dexterity

  It's Friday, and your summer vacation has just arrived.  
  No more losing sleep  over Mud-Finals.  You're sure you
  Can now  effectively keep  yourself out  of the eyes of 
  Midgard's Law enforcment, and you've been released from
  Parole.  Now,  you've decided to go on a trip with some
  of your friends.  Off to a  cabin in the  woods, for  a 
  nice relaxing vacation of Television, Sex, and some non-
  violent stress relief.  This  is a moment  all-too-long 
  coming!

Life is Good.~


  Would you look at that...  Up ahead of you, on
  this road seemingly leading into oblivion, are 
  two hitchhikers. One male, approximately 6'2",
  muscular, wearing blue jeans and a white Hanes
  T-shirt, and one  Female,  approximately 5'8",
  slender, graceful, and bright.  These have to 
  be the two most attractive people you have ever
  seen, and they don't appear to be together!


  Better pick them up and start "picking up" on
  Your game, before the other hitchhiker does!!

  It's been a good day, and  you  and you're feeling
  generous.  It sure was nice of you to pick up Both
  of those hitchhikers.  Who woulda known they would
  turn out to be such fascinating people.

  Cruisin  on, the forest becomes  a bit denser, the 
  light  a little more  filtered,  and signs of life 
  even  a  little  less  evident.  Hey   look,  some
  {RED}roadkill{red}.  Maybe  other cars  do come out  to this

  You've been driving an awefully long time now.  You
  Are beginning to wonder if you took a wrong turn out
  There somewhere.  There seems to be  a  lovely creek
  Flowing  a  small  way  down the ravine  to the west.  
  Maybe you will stop by and take a dip or something...
  Then again, getting to this mysterious cabin is very

{RED}The Bridge.{r}~

  Continuing up the driveway, you come to a large
  bridge.  Not the typical, creek-spanning bridge
  private residents usually have, but rather a
  gargantuan bridge of steel, wide enough for a 
  single vehicle.  It is placed upon two giant 
  pillars of stone, which reach down to the valley
  floor, thousands of feet below.

  This bridge affords you a wonderful view of the 
  now moon-glazed valley below.  This area is largely
  undeveloped.  You wonder what could have possessed
  anyone to build a summer home so far removed from 
  society.  The vegetation on the other side of the 
  bridge appears to thicken, but the driveway 
  continues on.  As your vehicle leaves the bridge,
  the moonlight becomes lost in the canopy of the
  giant trees above you.

  You can now see a faint light glowing
  up ahead.  So!  This is finally it!
  After traveling for what seems to be
  an eternity, you have finally made it
  to your cozy cottage in the forest.  
  Your bum aches from its long internment
  in its seat.  You want nothing more than
  to be done with driving, and to get on

  warm yourself, and get more aquainted with

  firelight coming from within the cabin.  You wonder
  if you should turn around, but you know that neither
  your weary passengers, nor your aching bum will allow
  you to do that.  Whoever these people in the house are

{RED,BO}Checkout Isle{r} of {BO,REV,WH} {r}{BLU,BO}Wal{REV,WHI} {r}{BLU,BO}Mart{WH,REV} {r}~


  {MAG}Business at its best.  A young woman of no more 
  than seventeen years stands here, wearing a pin
  stricken blue overcoat with the "Wal Mart" logo
  sprayed  across it.   Her yellow  stained teeth
  and overly made-up face reveal that this job is
  the perfect match for her.  Men and women stand
  waiting patiently while she toils with her cash
  machine.

{MAG}  Pants, shorts, shirts, tank-tops, underwear and
  ties.  This section is filled with tacky, funky
  clothing.  Every  distributer in  recent memory 
  that has suffered and dropped its quality has a
  rack here.  Wow!  Metallic boxers!  Great!  The
  selection  somehow  reminiscent of a  salvation 
  army... without the perks of those spiffy finds
  that seem  to sneak themselves  into the second 
  hand store.

{RED,BO}The {BLA}Shoe {YEL}Isle{r}~

{MAG}  The smell of artificial leather and fresh nylon
  permeate this isle.  The dim track lighting and
  the stale breeze create an sort of  nebula, and
  give  the effect  of one being  thrust into  an 
  episode of the twilight zone.... Doo do doo do.

{GRE,BO}Bozette{r}'{GRE,BO}s{r} {CY,BO}Travelling {MAG}Casino{r}!~


     {CY}Great and Mighty Bozo... benefactor and Master
     Trainer of Midgaard, most glorious city of the
     Northern Crossroads... had a younger sister.
     He doesn't much like to talk about her...
     Bozette was a coarse lass, always shedding her
     skirts for jeans, sneaking out late at night, 
     and searching for ways to have fun. She lacked
     the social refinement that Bozo expected from
     their great and noble family.

     {MAG}One day, after a particularly berating fight,
     where Bozo (then a young fledgling trainer)
     swore that if Bozette didn't clean her act up,
     she'd be disowned, Bozette decided it was time
     to move on with her life.  That night, eyes 
     bright and adventurous heart pounding... She
     strove forth into the world, to make a name 
     for herself.  It appears that Bozette has come
     back to Midgaard.{r}

  {BLA,BO}Entering this room, You are overtaken with the
  Urge to Kill your friends, and place them upon
  The Darkened, blood stained altar in the rooms
  Center, in an offering of  devotion to the one
  Standing behind it.  Upon  the  Altar is Bozo, 
  Your  beloved trainer.  His  eyes, glazed with
  The pain  of the torture he has been enduring,
  Wander over to you, and you see in them a  cry
  for release from his bonds.  Never before  has
  One so powerful been driven to such a weakened
  and powerless condition.  You look up from him
  and see  the  one standing  behind it.  As you 
  Look at  the figure, he removes his cowl,  and 
  Reveals his true identity.
