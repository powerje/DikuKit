The Golden Temple of Midgaard~
  You are in the southern end of the temple hall in the Temple of Midgaard.
The temple has been constructed from giant marble blocks, eternal in 
appearance, and most of the walls are covered by ancient wall paintings 
depicting Gods, Giants and peasants.

south.   The temple continues further to the west.
   To the east you can see what was once the donation room. You see a note
on the planked up door. To the north lies the the temple's altar where

mean that you type in a number.  ie,  TRAIN 30 W (that's a NO NO!)

To improve your STATS, you do the following:
TRAIN STR (for Strength) or TRAIN INT (for Intelligence), etc...

The Operating Room~

    You stare around in this room and shiver.  Rusty-looking
scalpels lay scattered disorganizedly in a tray on a table.
Flecks of dried blood is all over the floor, and even in little
patches on the walls.  You catch sight of strange organisms
floating in jars of formaldehye.  A hunchbacked doctor stands
at a wooden platform with his back to you.  He is struggling
with a patient who is trying to escape.

The Waiting Room~

     You stare around in the waiting room.  A sweet feminine
voice speaks up from behind you, 'How may I help you?'  You
turn around, expecting a beautiful nurse, and barely hold back
a scream.  This is the ugliest nurse you've ever seen in your
life!  Face covered with wrinkles and hairy moles, she scowls
at you, looking even more hideous than ever, and speaks again
in that strange sweet voice, 'Well?'  To the west, you can
hear a scream of agony and a loud crack and thump.

  This is, by far, the most beautiful part of a church you've ever 
seen!  Look at that windows. The light floods through the windows in all 
those lovely colours of the rainbow.  Your hard feels warm and tender. 
This must be the most peaceful place on earth.  There is a little sign on

  When you look around you, it seems, that little transparent air
spirits are dancing in the colourful light of the Cathedral.  Alongside
the wall are some pictures and statues of holy people.  All dead of
course.  Only dead people are holy people.  You decide to stay what you
are - not holy.  To the south you see the side aisle continue.  To the
west you see the entrance to the tower of the Temple.

Looking down on Temple Square you can see all those little adventurers seeking
for fame and glory.  How nice they look from here.  Like little toy soldiers.
Oups! Don't lean yourself too far out.  There is no balustrade here.  But you
can go any direction, if you want.  As you look up, you enjoy the clean air of
Midgaard. It would be nice to have the ability to fly .........

  "What is thy bidding my master?"  The statue begins to glow with the his
  power, releasing a massive bolt of red energy which sends you flying to 
  the back wall.  When you regain consciousness, you find your extremely
  strong and lusting for blood.  Once Forge had put his black mark on your

 Hello, this is my room. If you are here as a friend, thanks for gracing

 a snooze. But if you pop my bed, I'm going to use you to fill it back up.
 
 If you are not here as a friend, go ahead and kick back and relax a while 
 too, I'll be here soon, and I've been needing some more people to...help 
 me gain the favor of the almighty Forge and Rygar..

  hardest parts of the MUD.  You fell at ease knowing Brandy is somehow

Bielnack~
 
 
 
  Glancing around, the room seems quite plain...for a Hell-Spawn. There are 
  two altars on one side of the room, awaiting the daily sacrifices of 
  enemy flesh to Forge and Rygar. On the opposite side of the room there
  is a large oddly colored ornate waterbed. Approaching the waterbed, you
  begin to realize why the room smells so bad...It seems that the bed 
  itself is filled with the blood and eyeballs of the occupant's slain foe.
  How nice...Upon the wall rest a Group portrait of some of HELL's elite 
  members. Next to it hangs a long silver framed piece of parchment. 
  Examining the parchment you see it is a list of rival clan members who 
  have fallen to the iron fist of HELL. There seems to be plenty of room at
  the end for more names. A sign seems to be hovering above the waterbed...
  ...hmm.

  When you enter Laya's Bondage Chamber your mind becomes soft like jello
  and you have a sudden will to submit. You are amazed at all the leather

  You now know why it's a bondage chamber as you see a broken down bed, and
  not from age. The black sheets and shackles give you a provoking insight 
  into Laya's more specialized interests. Now you just want to sit around
  and wait for Laya to return to practice a little BONDAGE!!!

  outstretched hands floating here. Then realize a minor thousand kills is
