Out on a Limb~

  {G}You are standing on a small cypress limb. From this height you can see
  the bottom of the marsh more clearly.  Large crocodiles and alligators
  float in the putrid marsh awaiting their next meal.   The sun is still
  well hidden by the thick foliage, so it makes your climb more difficult{g}.

Through the Foliage~

  west you notice a small island, with a town at its center.
  To the north you see a fantastic castle with buildings
  fashioned from the ancient Greek buildings of myth. To the
  east you notice a massive castle. It looms far overhead and
  casts a shadow all about the top of the trees{g}.

Within the Wall~

  {BO}{B}The dark walls are covered in a thick black film. The stench
  of rotting flesh fills the room and makes you very ill. A small,
  unnatural light glows upon the high ceiling. You hear the faint
  sound of dripping water coming out from the cracks in the walls.
  Just standing here fills your head with thoughts of death{b}.

The Threads of the Tapestry~

  {C}You seem to have entered the mythical Castle of Tapis.  However,
  this seems more like a Church than a Castle. Large stained glass
  windows allow you to view the entire realm of Northern Crossroads.
  Pillars, constructed of marble, reach up to a large golden dome.
  Globes of light, which seem to burn their own fuel, cast shadows
  across large balls of multi-colored twine{c}.
