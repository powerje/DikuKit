A dark tunnel~
   You stand inside a small underground tunnel.  The ceiling is so low that
you must crouch to avoid hitting your head.  The tunnel continues north and
south.  To the west you see a Shirriff Post while to the east lies a small
home.  All you can see is darkness.

Shiriff Post of the Lower Shire~
   You are in the shiriff Post which acts as the nucleus for the three shiriffs 
of the Lower Shire.  As you examine the shiriffs on duty, you come to realize
that the halflings of the Shire are not to be reckoned with.  You cower with
awe.  The only exit is to the east.

A halfling hole~
   You stand inside a rather crudely built halfling hole.  The many passageways
and winding paths remind you of a rodent's lair.  The air is musty and damp
and you feel the need for fresh air.

The First Diku Bank~
   You are in a massive building.  It seems this is the main office
of the bank.  Now you know where all the ATM's came from.  The only
exit is to the east.
