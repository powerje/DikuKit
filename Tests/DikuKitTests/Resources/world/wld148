{B,BO}Times Square{bo}~
 
       {G}You are standing in the infamous Times Square with hundreds of
       people walking past as you stare towards MTV's TRL building to
       the south.  A crowd of crazed fans has already swarmed the 
       outside of the building and are starting to spill into the 
       street.  If you wanna have a chance at making it inside you 
       had better get going.{bo}

The Wasteland~
 
The sun is barely visible behind the cloud filled sky, ushering in just enough
of the tainted light to view this miserable landscape.  Puddles cover almost
the entire surface as far as the eye can see except to the north where some
small hills can be seen.  A strange grass grows just beside the the north side
of each puddle making identification of where you've been and where you are
going a bit more difficult.  Hopefully the hillside to the north will help out
with your bearings in this place.

       ceiling slowly spinning around.  Upon further inspection you
       also realize that the sand and waves is nothing more than an
       elaborate backdrop.  And here in front of everything is a 
       large dance floor!{bo}

       instruments.  There doesnt appear to be much going
       on in here, just the setup for the show later tonight.
