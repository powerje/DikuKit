The Dance machine~
As you enter the room, you see the psychadelic lights, and people wearing
clothes that must of been bought at that new "It came from the 80's
store...hmm..interesting...at one side of the room you see a group of 
people doing some sort of dance...

   Suddenly you recognize the dance, seeing as how you did this dance
as a teenager! Its the Locomotion! AH! ...you also notice over in a 
corner, a teenager...6'1 brown hair & eyes, wearing bellbottoms, and
a necklace with the peace symbol hanging on the end...ah..that must
be their leader...LOCO!

   You step out of your car and see the beautiful city of Washington
   D.C. As you look off into the distance, you see the White House.
   Just then you see a tour bus drive up with a white sign on the side
   that says "{BLUE,BOLD}Tour bus{blue,bold}". You hop on.

On A Dirt Backroad~

   You tell the guide to take the dirt road you see up ahead. As he turns
   onto it, you see what appears to be an old shack slowly coming into view.

On the ground~
     
   You feel your seat jerk out from under you and notice that your genius
   tourguide drove the bus straight into a pothole at least 5 ft. deep and 3
   ft. wide. You pick yourself up and start inspecting for any wounds and you
   notice a big lump on the back of your head. You start muttering what a 
   wonderful idea this trip was to yourself, when you notice the old shack
   you had been admiring on the bus isn't more than one hundred feet away.

   You walk into the shack, and you see sitting out on the porch, an old
   overweight balding man slumped over sleeping in his chair, who some might
   classify as a "Redneck". You also notice that the shack is made completely
   of wood, but you can hear a woman inside talking in a stern voice to
   someone. You also notice the old man has a double barrel shotgun in his
   lap...better leave him alone...

   you...it states "{RED}NCMUD{red} weenies can't survive more than 10 minutes in
   Washington D.C.!".... heh well you'll have to show the person who

Whitehouse entrance~

   You begin walking up the path towards the {WHITE,BOLD}Whitehouse{white,bold} door, when you see
   that up ahead there are some men in {BLACK}black{black} jackets, with little cords
   running into their ears, and lumps in their jackets resemble silencers
   gee..I wonder...could they be secret service?
 
   You walk up to the entrance and they inform you that "{BLUE,BOLD}The President is using
   the Whitehouse and has requested not to be bothered, so all visitors
   are banned.{blue,bold}"
    
   So this guy is telling you that you just spend 3 hours on a plane,
   2 hours on a highway, and now your vacation is cancelled?
   {RED}HA! LIKE HELL IT IS!{red}

Loco's personal Postoffice.~
Wow! This must be the first postoffice you ever came to where there
was no line, and one box on the wall...the stamp despensors all have
the word "FREE" where the normal .25 would be! This is cool, the 
man behind the counter has a shotgun...but at least he doesnt look 
*that* disgruntal....
 
All of a sudden Loco pulls up in his car, goes up gets his mail, looks
you over and says "Watch out for Bob"...you wonder to yourself who 
the hell Bob is, when you turn around, and find the man behind the
counter levelling off his shotgun to your face...aw shit!

{WHITE}Place where things go {BLUE,BOLD}BOOM{blue,bold}!~
  This place is wierd man....there are little containers sitting on
shelves tagged with labels such as "Explosives" "Mustard Gas" 
"C4" and other extremly dangerous objects....the guy who takes care
of this room must be some nutcase...SQUISH...aww man, you just stepped
in a big pile of dog shit...yuck...you better tell Loco to clean his
mess after he's done testing in here.
 
  Loco is over in the corner, with a carving knife in one hand, and
holding a mouse down to the table with the other, suddenly you hear
"eeee" then a slicing noise, a mouse head rolls to your feet, Loco
turns around and with a grin on his face says "Next!"

{WHITE}Bungalow 9{white}~

   You enter a Bungalow made of thatch and notice some {WHITE}coconuts{white} on a table
   against a far wall of the room. There is a fragrance that seems to be
   originating from the patio.
   
   As you look out past the patio, you see the ocean. People are swimming,
   water skiing, snorkeling, windsurfing, and many other various relaxing
   activities...maybe you should join them. There's a {CYAN}Speedo{cyan} hanging on the
   wall, and a bottle of sun tan lotion on the nightstand.
  
   You go out to the patio to find Loco resting in a bamboo chair. He
   seems focused on the {MAGENTA}topless{magenta} women who are frolicking about on the
   beach ...ahh, this is the life.
    
   On the top of a small table located in the middle of the room rests a
   {BLACK}9mm glock{black}, a laptop, a cellular phone, and a {YELLOW}manilla folder{yellow} marked 
   "{RE,BOL}TOP SECRET{re,bol}"  ...maybe you should examine it...
