The piles of paper on a tall oak desk almost completely hide the clerk.
She stands up and peers down at you from over her reading glasses
and asks "Is there anything I can help you with sirs?" You decline
and examine the rest of the room. Useless pictures of old ships hang
of these walls like flies but bring a strange calm to the environment

either sells alcohol or something very closely related to alcohol.
Most of the people walking down this street do so in a a very awkward

They call this area of town, "The Four Corners." It's essentially been
been turned into a one acre red light district. Even at this time of

trying to tempt some of the drivers. The most surprising thing about
the area is that police officers seem to be as much of a client as
the people coming home from a hard day of work. Off to the south,  standing
by itself is a rather normal looking house, not a brothel like the rest
of these dwellings.

{YELLOW}{BOLD}Catwom{BLACK}an's Pl{YELLOW}ay Pen{bold}~
The lighting in this room is awful and you can barely see a foot in
front of you. As you make your way through the room, you step on several
cats.  In what appears to be the middle of the room you run into to a
hard object right about knee level. Suddenly, before you can investigate
further, you realize you're staring right into a pair of glowing eyes.

{YELLOW,BOLD}The {WHITE,BOLD}Kit{YELLOW,BOLD}chen{yellow,bold}~
Dirty plates and glasses are piled two feet high in the sink. The 
shelves are full of cats, and cat food. A cat has even managed to make
the inside of an oven its home. The {MAGENTA,BOLD}pink{magenta,bold} walls are obscured only
by streaks of {WHITE,BOLD}black spraypaint{white,bold}. You can't help but wonder why the
house is such a disaster.

Here, you see more {MAGENTA,BOLD}pink{magenta,bold} walls with{WHITE,BOLD} black spraypaint{white,bold} all over them.
There is a wooden stand in the corner, with a phone and an answering
machine next to it. You almost knock it over as you pass it. You also
notice a ratty sofa, chair and TV set pushed up against the wall. It
looks like this place has been abused.

{BLUE}{BOLD}Center of City Hall{bold}~
The center of City Hall has a beautiful domed roof, with arcitecture
reminiscent of the White House. A pair of pillars stand at each of
the four cardinal directions. Behind each is a door or a hallway.
In the middle of the room there sits a small desk with a receptionist
sitting directly behind typing away vigorously. You are stunned by the
quality of the room compared to that of the city, those poor people
have probably never even thought of anything this beautiful.

the center. The smell of burning wires and the sight of sparks
discourages any further investigation. Everything else in the

Ugh, you can't help but notice the colors green and
purple all around you. Those colors simply clash, and make
you want to puke. That combination of colors seems to
disorient you, and you don't know where you will end up next.

Now you start to notice a strange smell in the room. You spot
a staircase over in the corner. The stairs on the case look
very slippery, and you might fall if you're not careful.

make you smile and laugh, and you can't control it. Some little
toys start to come out and try to attack you. As they do, a pasty
faced man jumps into the room and intoduces himself to you. Then
he pulls a gun and starts to attack!
