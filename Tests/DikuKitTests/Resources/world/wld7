In the Stadium~
  You pass through the doors, and as you enter you see the walls are
lined with food vendors, people selling NHL clothing...interesting..

 
  When you look at your ticket stub, you see that you are in seat 24,
row A, section VI....better go get your seat before someone else does.

At seat~
  Well, you reached your seats, only problem is that there is a bunch
of guys sitting in them...maybe if you ask politely they'll leave.
 
  You go up to one of them, and ask if you could have your seats back,
and the heavy set one of the bunch gets up and burps loudly, pulls out
a pocket knife, looks into your eyes and says " Feelin Lucky...Punk?"

  You've reached the far side of the ice, where the goalie is...he looks
pretty dangerous...with that big stick and all those pads he has..
He seems to be cursing at you to move out of the way so he can see 
the puck...oh shit...he just let a puck go by because you were blocking
him...now he's pissed....
