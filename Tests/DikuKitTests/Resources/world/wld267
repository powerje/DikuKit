The Geometry of Shadows~
The Babylon Project was our last, best hope for peace. A self-contained
world five miles long, located in neutral territory. A place of commerce
and diplomacy for a quarter of a million humans and aliens. A shining
beacon in space, all alone in the night. It was the dawn of the Third
Age of Mankind... the year the Great War came upon us all. This is the
last of the Babylon stations. The year is 2259. The name of the place is
Babylon 5.

Observation Dome~
It is quiet in the Observation Dome on Babylon 5, a rare hour when there
are no ships scheduled to depart or arrive at the station. Only the
skeleton crew of duty technicians sit at their consoles, intent on their
work.

Upper Level of Observation Dome~
When it is quiet, with no ships departing or approaching the station, an 
observer can look out through the curved windows and see the stars glowing
silently against the black backdrop of space. At times like these it might
be possible to contemplate teh infinity of the cosmos and wonder at your
place in the universe.

{BOL}{YEL}Entering Yellow Sector{yel}~
Located aft of the Grey Sector and the carousel, Yellow Sector does not
rotate. It contains the variable-g research labs as well as the primary
fusion core and the associated subsystems. Cooling fins run the length
of the sector, located on the outside of the hull.

{BOL}{RED}Entering Red Sector{red}~
Red Sector is the main marketplace and business area. Together with
service facilities such as Medlab 1, the Judicary, Security Central,
and the holding cells, the principal areas of note here include the
Zocalo, hotel suites, casinos, bars, legal brothels, and stores of
all types. Red Sector is a public area. Civilian access is granted
at all times.

{bla}Entering Grey Sector{bla}~
The Grey Sector is adjacent to the aft end of the carousel. The 
fabrication furnaces, rotation drives for the principal mag-lev
bearings, and the alpha power station are located here. The 
atmosphere monitoring station and maintenance facilities are next
to the hull. The structure is incomplete due to financial
restrictions. Scans are frequently ineffective in this sector, and
communication levels on either side of deck 17 are unreliable at
best. Deck 17 itself cannot be accessed due to computer/elevator
malfuction and is currently under investigation. Deck 17 is off
limits to all but Security Personnel.

{BOL}{GRE}Entering Green Sector{gre}~
Green sector is adjacent to the forward end of the Zen Garden and
contains ambassadorial suites and associated chambers. Green Sector
has multiple BabCom access points and is one of the main areas of
focus for the Security Department. In recent years there has been an
increase in diplomatic missions, and more governments are extablishing
embassies on the station. As space on Babylon 5 is tight, it is not
possible to give everyone offices. Communal offices, meeting rooms,
and conference rooms are available, as is access to the station's 
business facilities. Access is restricted to ambassadors and their
staff and to command and Security personnel. Civilian access is denied
except by permission of ambassadors or command staff.

{BOL}{GRE}Entering Down Below{gre}~
Located between the Garden and the hull, Down Below consists of several
square kilometers of decks in which no new development has occurred
due to financial cutbacks made by the Earth Alliance during station
construction. Human and non-Human dropouts live here in shantytowns
that are always moving. Illegal brothels, drug emporiums, and illegal
medical facilities are to be found here. Down Below is an undeveloped
area and may account for ninety percent of station crime. The inhabitants
exist in an economy based mainly on barter. Food is scarce here. The
unwary visitor may be killed and eaten as easily as mugged. Access is
restricted to Security personnel and command staff. Public access is
discouraged at any time.

the hedge maze, the Zen Garden, the sports fields, the Rotunda, the
Mosque. Twelve square miles of parkland wrapped into a hollow cylinder
a mile and a half in diameter.

{BOL}{GRE}Down Below{gre}~
The heat comes from the heat exchangers and processors which feed down
from the boulevards on the upper levels. The light comes from whatever
bulbs can be scrounged from topside. Occasionally starlight rises in
narrow beams through portholes set in the floor. Once every twenty-four
hours Epsilon Eridani shines through the portholes, but that light is
diffused by distance and by grime on the crystal alloy panes. Even so it
lights up Down Below in a series of radiating shafts, each moving as
the station rotates, to send ovals of light gliding slowly across the
walls, ceilings, the people, the machinery, the service ducts and stalls.

You make your way slowly past a line of moisture reclaimers sucking
condesation off a bulkhead wall. The reclamiers gurgle noisily as
they process foul sludge into drinking water at various rates of 
efficiency.

A line of desks and clerks and slightly substandard computers, converyer
belts full of embarking or disembarking passengers, manual and automated
luggage, a high level of background noise, a higher level of holographic
advertising and the usual incomprehensible announcements, as incomprehensible
in Drazi and Pak'ma'ra as they are in english. Effeciency and processing
time through Customs is key.

You find yourself trapped in a uncomfortably small cardboard box.
The smell of urine permeates from the moist mildew covered box
floor. A small tare in the upper left corner allows just enough
fresh air to keep you alive.
