{C}WELCOME!{c}~
{Y,BO}
  Welcome home!
{y,bo}{C}
  Danger and I discussed a desire to have a permanant
  space that we can call home.  This will allow all of
  us a place to keep our personal rooms and work areas.
  Right now some of us have rooms in zones that can be
  repopped when we enter the game. Others have objects in
  our rooms that are more at risk of theft once
  the zone is opened. Everytime I open a zone I move my
  personal rooms to a new zone. This will avoid the time
  I waste moving rooms as well. Please don't be a room hog or
  you may be asked to give up some rooms as the need 
  changes. This zone will allow you to use all 100 rooms of
  the zones you are currently in.

Mephisto's Top-Secret Home Away From Home~


  {BO,W}You are surrounded by translucent walls, floor and ceiling.
  Only the thick rugs and tapestries conceal you from those 
  outside this chamber.  The tapestries are decorated with 
  flowing scenes showing the sacred {BO,Y}Inner {BO,G}Circle {BO,W}as it was 
  during the time of creation.  A large wardrobe sits next 
  to a large, luxurious bed.  Beside the wardrobe is a chest
  with a picture of fresh water sitting on it.  On the wall 
  across from the bed, an open window that lets in the cool 
  breeze.  Close to the window sits a large comfortable chair.
  This is the private room of {BO,R}Mephisto{BO,W}, the leader of {BO,BLUE}({BO,R}T{BO,Y}I{BO,G}C{BO,BLUE}).
     
     {BO,R}He that is our constant. {BO,Y}He who holds us together.
                {BO,G}He who completes the Circle.{bo,g}

Lair of the Deathwyrm~

  You are now in the den of Deathwyrm. Half gnawed bones,
  some with bits of flesh still attatched, litter the room.
  At least half of them were of human origin. What could
  such a fearsome creatue want with you?

Deathwyrm's Throne Room~


  You are standing in the center of a vast vaulted chamber.
  Shining white columns rise from the polished marble floor,
  and radiant rays of sunglight stream  between them. As you 
  look out, you realize that the whole chamber is floating 
  amid the clouds. A gentle gust brushes past you, ruffling
  your hair. You breathe deeply, enjoying the fresh crisp
  air, which carries just a hint of ambrosia.

  In the center of this chamber is a large marble throne shaped
  like a dragon. On this throne rests a being of immense power,
  glowing with the might of the gods. With a wave of his hand,
  he conjures a table and chair so that you can be seated near
  him, and then with a snap of his fingers creates a sumptious
  banquet that kings would go to war for. You feel yourself
  relax, finally at peace with the world...
