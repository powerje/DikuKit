You have begun your trek into the hills....
It is obvious that the larger animals of this area
roam these slopes.  You see very large footprints
left by some of these animals and you can tell that,
at least some of these guys are BIG puppies....

End of Maidens Walk~
You have reached the end of Maidens Walk.  The road ends
abruptly and all that you can see in front of you are endless
acres of fields growing everything from corn to zucchini.  As
you have come to discover in this area, it is mainly populated
by those persons you see far off working the land.

Maiden s Walk~
This area is pretty quiet and peacefull, much different then
the hustle and bustle of the city proper.  You hear some
movement inside some of the houses as you pass, but even
that seems quiet and subdued.  You pass and occasional 
child along the way, and they seem to just stare wide-eyed
at you, not fearfull, but curious.  These same farm type
houses appear to line the street on both sides as far as you
can see.

for this town.  It is richly decorated with statues
and plaques celebrating this town's wonderful
heritage.  You notice that this is at the joining
of three roads, one each to the north, south and
east,with an impressive building to the west.
There is a fountain at the center of this square and
the women come from thier homes to draw water from
it and pass the time in idle conversation around it.
If you had to guess, you'd say that this was some
type of a meeting place for celebrations and such.

Peacefull Ave.~
As you walk down this short stretch of Peacefull Ave, you think it s 
fitting that this area should end with a wonderful name such as 
peacefull.  As you watch the children at play and the housewifes 
busy about thier daily chores, you think what it would be like for 
you if things had turned out differently in your life ...

Corner of Maidens Walk and Peacefull Ave.~
You turn the corner onto Peacefull Ave and you see a few more
of these dainty, small farm houses.  There are a couple children
playing in the street, which is very short and ends abruptly at
more of the fields that give these people thier livelihood.

Maiden s Walk~
This area is pretty quiet and peacefull, much different then
the hustle and bustle of the city proper.  You hear some
movement inside some of the houses as you pass, but even
that seems quiet and subdued.  You pass and occasional 
child along the way, and they seem to just stare wide-eyed
at you, not fearfull, but curious.  These same farm type
houses appear to line the street on both sides as far as you
can see.

Corner of Coventry St. and Maidens Walk~
You have reached the end of Coventry Street and are
now standing at it s intersection with Maiden s Walk.
Just north of you is what looks to be a small farm house
and you are quite certain that it must belong to one of
those people you saw as you walked up here.  This area
is surrounded by fields just like those and it appears that
these houses are for those people.  Maiden s Walk 
continues to the east and west.
