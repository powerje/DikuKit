{M}Great {W}Fairy's {M}Fountain{m}~

     An elegant rug leads up to a large fountain here
     bearing the symbol of the TriForce.  The low steady

{G}Link's {Y}House{y}~

     This small home built into the trunk of a deku tree seems
     all too cozy.  A small table made from a stump stands in
     the rooms center.  A bed, several chairs and a wash basin
     line the rooms perimeter.  A window lets in only a small
     bit of sunlight while the door to the east stands wide open.

     other walls are lined with a couple of chests, a wash basin
     and several chairs standing around a childsized table.
     A small kokiri girl sits atop one of the chairs.  She smiles

     Two beds sit atop an elevated section of this room
     with a small set of steps leading down to you.  The
     Kokiri twins keep the house very neat as nothing
     seems to be out of place.  The twins sit at a small
     wooden table opposite the beds.

{BLU}Bend in The Road{blu}~

     This well travelled road lead through the hills
     which seperate Hyrule Castle from the market and
     town.  Many royal guards roam about on the lookout
     for trouble.  A large boulder sits against the
     hill to the east as if to seal a different route.

{BLU}Hyrule Castle{blu}~

     Hyrule Castle seems even larger on the inside than
     outside.  Elegant decore and beautiful craftsmanship
     are evident all around you.  Many royal guards are
     wandering about here ensuring the safety of Princess
     Zelda.  The castle's courtyard lies to the west.
     Perhaps there will be less guards there....

     The courtyard's walls are lined with strands of ivy
     dangling down from atop the walls.  The garden here
     is well kept and beautiful.  Across the garden a 
     beautiful young girl stands peering into a nearby
     window.  She doesnt realize you are here.  Maybe
     saying her name will get her attention..

     The Temple of Time stands just as it has for as long
     as any can remember.  Its stone walls stand just as
     strong now as they did centuries ago.

     To the north Castle Hyrule looms in the distance.
     Over the temple and to the east Death Mountain is
     visible stretching into the clouds.

{Y}The {BO,Y}Spirit{bo,y} {Y}Temple{y}~

     You stand in the center of a large square platform
     which seems suspended over a dark chasm.  A cold wind
     raises the hair on your neck as it rushes around your
     body.  A beautiful woman with long red hair appears
     at the platform's edge.  She begins to move closer..

{BL}Road To {BO,BL}Ganon's{bo,bl} {BL}Castle{bl}~

     This road looks nothing as it did before Ganon's
     castle took Hyrule's place.  The trees and grass
     are long since gone leaving the area barren and
     desolate.  Hovering above a moat of burning lava
     Ganon's castle tower reaches high into the dark
     clouds.

     A large boulder rests to the east and a magical
     bridge begins to form to the north allowing access
     to the castle's entryway.

     The sage's magic has formed a bridge crossing the
     gap to Ganon's Castle.  The magically glowing bridge
     pulses with magic as the colors of the medallions
     flow through it.

{BL}Castle {BO,BL}EntryWay{bo,bl}~

     Six magical barriers glowing with power block your
     way north.  These must be the barriers Zelda told
     you about!  Only the six medallions can dissipate
     the powerful barriers.

     Beyond the barriers you can see a corridor leading
     farther north into the castle's tower.

{BL}Ganon{BO,BL}'{bo,bl}{BL}s {BO,BL}Chambers{bo,bl}~

     This large room is completely surrounded by huge
     stained glass windows which flash colorful moving
     images across the floor.

     With his back turned to you Ganon plays at an organ
     near the north wall.  Suddenly he stops playing and
     turns his attention to you.  He then floats into the
     air and laughs as he begins to attack!
