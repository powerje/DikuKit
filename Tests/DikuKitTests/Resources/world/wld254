   The tunnel ends here.  The pipes continue on into the earth, but this
is as far as you can go.  High above your head there appears to be an 
air shaft, but the walls of the tunnel are far too slippery to climb.
You must turn back.

Smelly Sewer~
Eeeew!  The stench of raw sewage grows stronger as you enter this
tunnel.  Above you, a rickety old set of tunnel lights provides
enough illumination for you to avoid stepping on the rats.
The tunnel continues to the east and west.

A Bend in the Smelly Sewer~
Whew!  What's that smell?  You hold your nose and try to breathe from
your mouth.  Now if you could just avoid swallowing the flies, it would be
bearable.  Some of the lights are burned out, forcing you to squint.  That
damned map... don't you wish you had it now?

Smelly Tunnel~
The sewer tunnel widens slightly here.  You stand up and stretch,
grateful that you don't have to continue walking around like a
hunchback.  The ground is drier, and there is a curious absence of
pipes.  The overhead lights emit a dingy glow.  Ahead, you hear some
rumbling.  Maybe you should investigate.

Rumble, Rumble, Rumble~

The rumbling is getting louder.  The smell has changed from stinky to 
all-out gross!  Small lumps of a nondescript material are scattered on
the floor.  Just above your head, the lights are shaking with each 
tremor, casting odd shadows all around.  There's a small indentation in
the wall.  Looks like someone poked a hole here.

Rumble, Rumble, Rumble~
The rumbling is starting to sound more like footsteps... heavy ones,
and lots of 'em.  Maybe you should turn back now, but then there's
still the unexplored, and you know that you'll never be able to sleep
at night without knowing what lies ahead.

Welcome to the HippoDrome!~
Uh oh... now you've done it!  You shake the crud from yourself, stand
up, and look around.  What IS this place?  Thunderous footfalls are all
around you, and the ground trembles almost continuously.  Small
lumps are scattered around the floor.  The stench is revolting,
and nothing makes it go away.

Enter the HippoDrome!~

Hippos, hippos, everywhere!  You've entered the infamous HippoDrome, and now
you're stuck!  Heavy footfalls indicate the presence of these beasts, tromping
through the sewers as if it were truly home to them.  Small clouds of dust
billow around the corner, and the heavy scent of methane hangs in the air.

You can make out an inscription on the wall...

HippoDrome~

Hippo pictures cover the walls.  Hippo crap is all over the floor.  There are
small puddles of a yellowish liquid emitting a foul odor.  You don't want to
know what that stuff is...  the stench and dim light combine to make your 
head spin, and it's hard to remember which direction you came from.  Maybe you
should have packed some noseplugs and a map.

HippoDrome~

Hippo pictures cover the walls.  Hippo crap is all over the floor.  There are
small puddles of a yellowish liquid emitting a foul odor.  Something drips
the same liquid from the ceiling.  Maybe you should move aside...  the stench
and dim light combine to make your head spin, and it's hard to remember which
direction you came from.  You raise your hands in a gesture of hopelessness,
and look up, expecting to see a higher power.

A voice booms down, "Hahaha!  You're stuck in a pile of hippo shit!"

KingHippo's Lair!~

Ah HAH!  You've found the lair of the mighty KingHippo!  Bits
of grass and piles of newspaper are laying around.  Bigger piles
of hippo crap sit in groups all over the floor.  Yeesh... this guy
doesn't get out too much.
KingHippo sits in a corner, grunting loudly.  He yawns, and you see
inside his huge, gaping mouth.  Watch out, he just might bite a chuck
of you!

   Piles of layout plans and other sheets of paper lay on the thick
wooden table.  A dim light makes reading them barely possible.  The 
room is tight and damp.  A few cages line the walls full of wild 
beasts that were brought in from deep within the sewers.  They are
rather sedated and harmless, but they sure do STINK!!!
