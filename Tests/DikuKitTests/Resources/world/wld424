{BO,GRE}Turning Toward the West{b}~

   {BO,GRE}Walking away from the city wall and over fields of soft grass 
   dotted here and there with daisies and buttercups, the Emerald 
   City is soon left behind. {b}

{YEL}Toward the West{b}~

{YEL}   As you advance the ground becomes rougher and untilled, for 
   there are no houses, farms, nor farmers in the country of the 
   West.  

{BO,BLA}   You soon come to the edge of a ravine. As you look down into
   the darkness, crumbling rocks make you lose your footing.{b}

{YEL}Country of {BO,BLA}the West{b}~

   {YEL}Each time you scramble a foot or so up the slope, you slip and 
   fall right back to the bottom of the ravine.

   {BO,BLA}You soon hear a cackle and whistle on the wind, surely of the 
   {GRE}Wicked Witch of the West{BO,BLA}, and at once there comes running
   from all directions a pack of great wolves.

{Y}Cornfield{b}~

   {YEL}The long rows of {GRE}green stalks {YEL}stand more than six feet tall with 
   yellow silk dangling from each ripening ear. Suddenly, 
   something - an animal? - darts across the corn rows. The 
   cornstalks begin to rustle and sway in the breeze. A rush of 
   terror overcomes you.

{BOLD,BLU}Caught in the Current{b}~

   {BO,BLU}You are caught in the current and swept downstream. You
   struggle to keep your head above water as you are pulled 
   down by an undertow. A few seconds underwater may 
   turn into an eternity if you yield to panic.    {b}

{BO,BLU}Riverbank{b}~

   {BO,GRE}Behind is the dark forest that you have passed safely 
   {b,YEL}through. Before you is a bright, sunny landscape that 
   appears to beckon you on to the Emerald City. Cutting you
   {BO,BLUE}off from this beautiful land is a broad river, flowing swiftly 
   just before you. On the other side of the water, you  see the 
   road of yellow brick amidst green meadows dotted with
   bright flowers.  {b}
