  With water bottle in hand, clubs slung over 
  the shoulder, a sweat soaked shirt and visor,
  you head back to the clubhouse to shower and
  rest up. Thinking back over the day, you 
  realize all that you have learned and smile
  at your own accomplishments. BUT most of all,
  you think about that hot steamy shower which
  awaits you.

  The kitchen still holds the stench of

  about the room and utensils scattered
  about. Large strands of spaghetti 
  decorate the walls. Everything shifted

  are now over your head, remain open.

{BLUE}Lake Jezl{blue}~
{BLU,BO}
  The calm surface of Lake Jezl is only
  disturbed by a few ducks that ignore
  all warnings and go for a swim. The 
  lake is the final resting place of 
  Lady Jezl, the dinner boat, which sank
  into the lake's floor. A piece of the
  boat peeks out at the surface to remind
  others of her presence. When the boat
  sunk, rescuers did all they could to
  save the crew, but failed. Lady Jezl
  awaits extraction from the lake.

{BLUE}Lake Jezl{blue}~
{BLU}
  The light reflects off the water's surface.
  Soft ripples form as frogs and small fish
  blow air up from below. The lake is pretty 
  quiet for the most part, but the occasional
  explorer visits the lake in hopes of finding 
  the treasure that is rumoured to be deep 
  below the surface in Lady Jezl's safe. However,
  club management strongly recommends no swimming
  and forbids diving.

  The light reflects off the water's surface.
  Soft ripples form as frogs and small fish
  blow air up from below. The lake is pretty 
  quiet for the most part, but the occasional
  explorer visits the lake in hopes of finding 
  the treasure that is rumoured to be deep 
  below the surface in Lady Jezl's safe. However,
  club management strongly recommends no swimming
  and forbids diving.

{CY}Depths of Lake Jezl{cy}~
{CY}
  You hold your breath while frantically
  searching for Lake Jezl's surface or
  the entrance to the ship. One of the 
  two has to be around here somewhere.
  Hope you find it before you pass out.

{CY}Lady Jezl{cy}~
{CY}
  You gasp for air and realize that you can
  breathe once again. Somehow Lady Jezl has 
  managed to remain air tight or perhaps,
  this is an illusion. Either way, it feels
  great to be in a drier room. So this is
  Lady Jezl...

{WH}Around Lady Jezl{wh}~
{CY}
  
  There is no telling just how long 
  Lady Jezl has been sitting at the
  bottom of the lake. However, the
  old dinner boat has begun to rust
  and small bits of algae are growing
  all around it.
