{bold}{RED}North entrance to the catacombs{bold}~
 
   You see an eerie tunnel leading off to the south into utter
   darkness. The ceiling is made up of old loose floorboards.
   From these floorboards, beams of light illuminate a message
   that has been scrawled on the wall. The message reads:
  
      Adventure for the strong yet calculating
      Death for the weak and shallow
      Treasure for the smart and lucky
      Death for the stupid and accursed
      {BOLD}{RED}IF YOU ARE DOING THE BC QUEST, TURN BACK AND GO BACK UP!{bold}
 
   An ancient Glyph above the entrance keeps monsters from
   wandering up from the catacombs.

   of light comes in from a hole in the ceiling.

{bold}{RED}Fresh graves{bold}~
 
   The graves here seem very recent.  You notice many signs of
   digging and defilement.  There are piles of fresh bodies here
   awaiting burial.  A strange sense of evil magic from the south
   causes the hair on the back of your neck to stand on end!

{bold}{RED}Southern gate{bold}~
  
   A rusty gate here no longer keeps anyone in or out.  You see a
   lonely passage to the south.  A little used trail winds east
   through a crack in the wall.

{bold}{RED}Scene of ghastly horror{bold}~
 
   An army of undead creatures of all types are lined up in rows
   and are waiting patiently. Their leader is an evil demonic
   necromancer.  He plans to use his army of undead to take over the
   world. Things seem about ready to get underway.

{bold}{RED}Twisty passage{bold}~
   
   This passage bends all over the place, which disorients you
   slightly. You seem to be able to go either north or east. You 
   can not see where either path leads.

   the west, an odd twinkling coming from the north, and it is
   unknown what lies to the south.

{bold}{RED}Intersection{bold}~
      
   A gruesome trail of blood and mangled body parts leads to the burial
   grounds to the north. There is a path to the west. You are
   overwhelmed with loneliness when you consider traveling in this
   direction. There is a fresh breeze coming from the south, and you
   realize it must lead out of this forsaken place.

{bold}{RED}Southern entrance to the catacombs{bold}~
 
   Through a trapdoor above you streams light.  Through a doorway,
   to the south, streams darkness.  A message has been scrawled
   upon the wall here.  The message reads:
 
      Adventure for the strong yet calculating
      Death for the weak and shallow
      Treasure for the smart and lucky
      Death for the stupid and accursed
      {BOLD}{RED}IF YOU ARE DOING THE BC QUEST, TURN BACK AND GO BACK UP!{bold}
 
   An ancient Glyph above the entrance keeps monsters from wandering
   up from the catacombs.

{bold}{RED}Descending into the Chasm{bold}~
 
   You can not believe the corpse of the dragon and the loot which
   was on it fell into this enormous pit in the ground. You never
   heard it actually hit the bottom but you feel like you must
   press on. The air is thick, and you find it hard to breathe...

   It seems as if there is no bottom, nor no top, just one 
   continuous pit. One could get lost in here, even if you where
   a ghost. Just like the one who is now staring at you!

   You now stand at the bottom of this great chasm. The loot from
