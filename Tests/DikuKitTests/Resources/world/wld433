{Y}An Ancient Library{y}~


   {Y}You have entered an old room, a very old room, an ancient 
   room. As the dust clears and your eyes adjust to the light,
   you notice several {Y,BO}leather bound tomes{bo,y}{Y}. Each tome is set
              upon it's own carved ivory pedestal.{y} 
                                                          
   {C}To visit one of these new worlds, all one must do is truly 
   and fully {BO,C}ENTER{bo,c} {C}themselves into the works of a great author. 
   Go on and enjoy the works of a true master, but beware and 
   take care, these are more than just stories. The lessons 
   learned here will last a lifetime, as will the injuries.{c}

{BO,BLU}Before the Dark Gate{bo,blu}~
 
    {BO,C}You have found the ancient source of this once great river. 
      At this point the river appears to emerge from the {Y}ground{C} 
    as if the {W}Valar{C}, themselves, were here spewing forth the 
   sacred water. Once again you are nagged by the fleeting 
      memory of your dream. You can remember the mighty {BLU}Ulmo{C} 
    standing at this very spot in the river bed, urging you 
      to go under the water and through the Dark Gate. Under 
     what water? There is nothing here but a dirty puddle.{bo,c}

   but at second glance you see it was forged by the water. 
   Forged by {C,BO}Ulmo the Valar{bo,c} {C}responsible for all things related
