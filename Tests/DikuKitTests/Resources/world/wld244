{GREEN}{BOLD}Ramshackle Wooden Gates before the Orcs Camp{bold}{green}~

{B} {b}{B} {b} {B} {b}{GREEN}You come up to what appears to be a small fence, about 
{B} {b}{B} {b} {B} {b}{GREEN}5 feet tall, made of planks of wood. The planks are barely 
{B} {b}{B} {b} {B} {b}{GREEN}connected to each other, much less the cross bars. You look
{B} {b}{B} {b} {B} {b}{GREEN}directly infrontof you and see a beaten gate serving as the 
{B} {b}{B} {b} {B} {b}{GREEN}main entry point into the camp. 

{B} {b}{B} {b} {B} {b}{GREEN}Two sentries are posted here, they don't look happy to see you.

{GREEN}{BOLD}Around the Orc's Campfire{green}{bold}~

{B} {b}{B} {b} {B} {b}{GREEN}You're standing in the center of the orc's camp. You seem 
{B} {b}{B} {b} {B} {b}{GREEN}to not have made much noise dispatching the two orc grunts 
{B} {b}{B} {b} {B} {b}{GREEN}guarding the small gate. Infront of you, you now see 2 massive 
{B} {b}{B} {b} {B} {b}{GREEN}bull-like creatures huddled over the fire. Apparently you aren't 
{B} {b}{B} {b} {B} {b}{GREEN}down wind since these bull-men have now stood up and are walkin 
{B} {b}{B} {b} {B} {b}{GREEN}toward you. 

{B} {b}{B} {b} {B} {b}{GREEN}Looks like they're wielding giant totem poles! This is going to hurt!

{B}{BLUE}Outside the Challenge Circle{b}{blue}~

{B} {b}{B} {b} {B} {b}{GREEN}Looking farther south you can see a very large orc brandishing 
{B} {b}{B} {b} {B} {b}{GREEN}a sword nearly as large as himself. It looks as if he's standing 
{B} {b}{B} {b} {B} {b}{GREEN}there waiting for you to come challenge him. Even from this 
{B} {b}{B} {b} {B} {b}{GREEN}distance you can a red glow emenating from his eyes.  

{B} {b}{B} {b} {B} {b}{GREEN}You should ready yourself for the fight ahead.

Wyverns' Hovel~
You stand in a large, dark studdy of some sorts. The walls are lined with books, many old and all are covered with
a thick layer of dust. As you scan the titles you see "Learning C" and "The Perl Cookbook".

At the far end of the room you see a large oaken desk and a chair sitting beside it. As you move close to the desk
a pair of hellhounds materialize and bark vicously at you. Perhaps it's best to not examine the desk.
