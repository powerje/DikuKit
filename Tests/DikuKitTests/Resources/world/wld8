{BO,BL}The {WH}Hall {BL}of{w} {R}Iscariot{w}~
   You stand in the middle of a large domed chamber. Five pillers, constructed
from the finest gold, support a marble ceiling forty feet above your head. A
throne, constructed of onyx, rests upon a piller of solid silver to the far
northern part of this fantasitc chamber. Three large pits, one to the east,
one to the west, and one to the south, emit a faint glow of unnatural light
which cast erie shadows upon the ancient walls. Standing directy before you is
an altar of pury ivory, with the skull and crossbones of a wreach resting
atop it. The ancient and mystical songs of Kirjath Sepher echo off of the
golden pillers and fill your soul with peace and tranquility. To the western
eastern walls you see magnificant tapestries weaved from golden threads. And
above the grand Throne of Onyx, you see the the legendary book of infinite
power.
