much more comfortable.  Here you seem able to clear your torn
mind and catch a breath before deciding to continue.  Candles 
emit a godly light upon the room.  Paintings of battles won were
once prominent on the walls surrounding you.  The figures on the
paintings are not quite recognizable but you can respect their
fortune as well as their losses.  Standing here sort of restrengthens
your thoughts and your physical being...{white}

{MAGENTA}This was once a place where members of the Grey Death

battles fought.  This was one of the few things that kept them
sane.  Or maybe one of the things that drove them to insanity.
Only they would know.  Looking around you see empty shelves 
nailed to the walls.  Books no longer decorate these shelves...
only lost dreams, hopes, and stories of forgotten souls.  You
feel your own sanctity in here.  Maybe a moment of silence for
you is in order...{MAGENTA}

a trail on the floor that looks to be old blood.  It looks like
someone or something was dragged along the floor.  You can tell
by the look of the blood that it is not fresh, so this doesn't
worry you too much..just hope whatever did that isn't still
here waiting for someone else...{GREEN}

{Y}BASEMENT ENTRANCE{y}~
 {CYAN}This dark dingey smelling area reminds you of a cemetary
on a foggy late night.  Of course, who would want to stay around
and visit one eh ? You cannot see in front of you at all.  It
smells like wet dirt, but you can't quite tell what your feet
may be touching.  If you go up you can go back to where you came
from.  But you seem like a brave person..to the north you can
continue your unknown journey.  To the east you hear a strange
noise...{CYAN}

Smelly Basement~
 {CYAN}This place is unmistakeably an old storage area.  What was
stored here is unknown to all and has been since The legion
first came about.  Legend has it that it was once used to store
corpses of those who trespassed into the realms of their world.
It has been said that they were taken into a basement underneath
The Legion and placed in steel coffins which were then welded on
to the walls that are surrounding you now.  No evidence supports
this but one thing has kept the legend alive...those who were
said to have came here...{CYAN}{RED}NEVER RETURNED{RED}{CYAN}...{CYAN}

around but you can't see anything.  Some pipe fittings still 
protrude out of the walls as if a machine of some sort was once
connected to them.  The noise is a familiar sound.  Common sense
tells you that this must be where the warriors used to come to
clean their blood stained clothing after battles.  But why is
something that is not even seen still running ?{GREEN}

invasion of the Legion.  Directly before the final raid and fall
of the Legion, the great council met here to give glory to their
fallen master.  They paid their final respects, said their last
prayers to him and went forth to defend there domain only to die
at the hands of those who didn't understand the meaning of what
they stood for.  But as they always said..."All good things must
come to an end."{WHITE}

{R}BANK OF HORROR{r}~
 {GREEN}Usually people came here to keep there money in order.  But
when the Legion was finally taken down, the ATM was destroyed 
and robbed of its fortune.  Noone really knows what happened to 
the gold that was here or even how much it was...but it was 
taken away.  Funny how after this took place numerous clubs came
out of nowhere and began to flourish.  This could have been a 
major plan from the get go.  Is it coming together for you yet?{WHITE}

{R}MESSAGE HALL{r}~
 {WHITE}Legioners once planned their attacks here in this room and
coordinated with one another when others were absent.  There were
never any unneeded messages here.  Everything in the Legion was
of the upmost seriousness.  This may have been why they were so
dominant during their time of power...{white}

{R}ROOM OF AVATARS{r}~
 {WHITE}Maps for the more experienced warriors were placed here for
their use when going on quests.  The maps were taken after the
fall of the Legion.  Every map imaginable of the places within
the realms of NC were placed here...{white}

{R}LOW LEVEL LOSER HANGOUT{r}~
 {WHITE}Just as many new people to places are broken in...they were
treated the same in the Legion.  Whenever someone devoted their
lives to the Legion and its leaders, they were of course picked 
at a little but treated with great respect.  Here they were able
to find maps to their places of interest.{WHITE}

{W}TRAGMOUR'S THRONE ROOM{w}~
 {MAGENTA}This is where the mighty leader stayed and gave out his
orders to bring more power to the Legion.  He was well respected
and honored by his followers.  His great throne sits in the very
center of the room.  Oh wait..he is still here guarding his lost
temple.  It has been said he still beleives he rules the most
powerful club on NC...BEWARE!!{MAGENTA}

This obscure room is filled with smoke and dimly lit
candles. Music can be heard coming from within the 
walls. A rhythmic bellow consumes your thoughts..
