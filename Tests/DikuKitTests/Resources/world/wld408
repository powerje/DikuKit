{BOLD,BLACK}Morlock's Tunnel{bold,black}~
  {BOLD,BLUE}
     As you enter the Danger Room, the room's shape starts to reconfigure 
     itself. You are suddenly blinded by a strange light and force down 
     to the ground. After a minute of readjusting your eyes, you 
     realized that Cerebro set the simulation to level 4 at your request.
    {BOLD,WHITE}
     DANGER ROOM LEVEL FOUR - ASTEROID M AND GENOSHA
  {bold}{BOLD,BLACK}
     Dreary, shadowy, murky, all words to describe the Morlocks' home. The Morlocks 
     are forced to live in the tunnels below the city to avoid the humans taunting 
     them. They live down here with dirty sewer rats. As you continue down the 
     tunnels, a huge alligator pops out of nowhere and starts to attack. The 
     rumors about alligators in the sewer were true. As you swing your sword 
     to attack the creature, the alligator disappears. At the corner of your eye, 
     you notice a small mutant, bald with green complexion, running away from you. {bold,black}

{BOLD,BLACK}Morlock's Tunnel{bold,black}~
  {BOLD,BLACK}
     You are in the domain of the Morlocks, a large group of mutants who were 
     disaffected with the outside world, and who had gone to live underground 
     to avoid being persecuted. As a display of their disgust for the values 
     of the outside world and their rejection of topside, most of the 
     Morlocks had their faces changed by Masque when they entered the society.
  {BOLD,BLACK}
     The tunnels are dark, as to disguise the ugliness of the area. You hear 
     rats squeak as you step on their hairy tails. Foul aroma of excreta 
     consumes you as you walk along the slimy, dingy trail.

     Several Friends of Humanity members are gathered together in the center 
     of the room shouting, 'Death to all mutants. Long live the Homo

{BOLD,BLACK}Morlock's Tunnel{bold,black}~
  {BOLD,BLUE}
     As you enter the Danger Room, the room's shape starts to reconfigure 
     itself. You are suddenly blinded by a strange light and force down 
     to the ground. After a minute of readjusting your eyes, you 
     realized that Cerebro set the simulation to level 4 at your request.
    {BOLD,WHITE}
     DANGER ROOM LEVEL FOUR - ASTEROID M AND GENOSHA
  {bold}{BOLD,BLACK}
     Dreary, shadowy, murky, all words to describe the Morlocks' home. The Morlocks 
     are forced to live in the tunnels below the city to avoid the humans taunting 
     them. They live down here with dirty sewer rats. As you continue down the 
     tunnels, a huge alligator pops out of nowhere and starts to attack. The 
     rumors about alligators in the sewer were true. As you swing your sword 
     to attack the creature, the alligator disappears. At the corner of your eye, 
     you notice a small mutant, bald with green complexion, running away from you. {bold,black}

  {BOLD,BLACK}
     You are in the domain of the Morlocks, a large group of mutants who were 
     disaffected with the outside world, and who had gone to live underground 
     to avoid being persecuted. As a display of their disgust for the values 
     of the outside world and their rejection of topside, most of the 
     Morlocks had their faces changed by Masque when they entered the society.
  {BOLD,BLACK}
     The tunnels are dark, as to disguise the ugliness of the area. You hear 
     rats squeak as you step on their hairy tails. Foul aroma of excreta 
     consumes you as you walk along the slimy, dingy trail.

     top. The air is highly corrosive, and the weather patterns are totally 
     different. The mutants there try to breed selectively to bear progeny 
     strong enough to make it to the top of the Hill and become Mikhail's

{BOLD}Descension!{bold}~

  {BOLD}   Welcome to Descension. The game where two teams battle it out for
     cash prizes but there can only be one winner. The rules are simple, 
     several questions will be asked to each members in their team. Every correct 
     answer will put 1 million into the pot, every wrong answer will deduct 500000. 
     After each round, a person on each team will be eliminated by their own 
     team members by secret vote. After all but one has been eliminated from each
     team, the jackpots from both team will be combined and the winner gets the 
     combined jackpot. Work as a team to put more money into the jackpot, eliminate
     those who would take it down, and survive to win the bigger jackpot.
