Under the water~


   As you dive under the water, you start to
   feel the water pressure on your lungs. It
   gets worse as you go deeper too.  But the
   fish get continually prettier as you go
   deeper. You begin to think that some of
   these fish would be very tasty. Maybe you
   should take a few with you?{bo}

{BO,CYA}The Road to Lake Powell{bo,cya}~

   {CYA}You have stumbled across a wide,  newly paved road.  You 
   close your eyes and breathe in the  {YEL}scents{CYA} being carried

   {BO,R}Finally you have found the source of that
   terrible noise, but I am not sure that
   is a good thing. Well think of it this way,

   You have entered a {Y}hole{y} in the {BO,Y}sand{bo,y}. Strange,
   this place looks exactly like the place you
   just came from. The {Y}hole{y} continues down, now
   what do you think could possibly be down that
   {Y}hole{y}? Maybe something worth getting?

   it still looks like you have never even moved.
   You are at the bottom of a {Y}hole{y} and the {W,BO}sun{w,bo}
   is still shining on you like you were in the 
   middle of the {Y,BO}desert{y,bo}. What sort of strange

   closer to the {BO,Y}sun{bo,y} and the {R}temperature{r} hasn't
   changed at all. You shake your head and
   decide never to drink anymore {BO,W}Oo{bo,w}{BO,Y}beer{bo,y}{BO,W}oO{bo,w}. There
   is still a place you can continue going up here.
   So you shake your head trying to clear it and
