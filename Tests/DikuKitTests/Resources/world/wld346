{BO,W}Launch Pad{bo,w}~
  
  
  {B,W}Sixty seconds.  That's how long you're required to stand on the launch
  pad before the sound of a gong releases you.  Step off before the sound
  of the gong and a land mind will blow your legs off.  Sixty seconds
  to evalute your surroundings, look for hidden doors, and wonder what 
  awaits you.{bo,w}
