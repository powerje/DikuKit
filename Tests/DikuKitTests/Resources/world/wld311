A large clearing in the Forest in a corner of the Great Lake.~

   The Forest thins out a lot, into a large clearing beside the Great Lake.
   To the south, the path continues through the deeper Forest, and the
   lakeside path runs east and north.
   Looking out over the Lake shows an island to the north west, and
   very close.
