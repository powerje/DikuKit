STUFF TO DO!~
 
  procs have been resent to Loco and Guard 8/11/04
 
  Enix is onboard to help with NPCs and gear ... fightable, basic eq
 
 added room 49103 as a mob chute for the NPCs. They are instazoned there now. As eq is created
 we will need to instazone the eq to them in that room. Make sure the stay-zone flags are NOT
 on these mobs as they are meant to wander the LS freely.

{BO,CY}The {bo,cy}{CY}Eudelta{BO,CY} Video Store{bo,cy}~

   {CY}Glass doors open quickly and silently before you, providing
   a blast of {WH}cool air {CY}from inside the building. As soon as you
   enter, the doors close and block out all of the noise coming
   from the busy streets of Eudelta. You slowly look around at the
   many {BO,YEL}bright{BO,WH} lights {BO,YEL}{BLINK}flashing{bo,yel}{blink}{CY} in hypnotic rhythms and settle

   {CY}As you walk further into the store, and further from the annoying
   ramblings of the storekeeper, you get more of a feel for the place.
   There are dozens of promotional posters for many movies, including
   "{RE}Morlock III: The {BO,RE}Demon's{bo,re}{RE} Awakening{CY}" and "{YEL}Zorro's Last Stand{CY}". There
   are two main aisles: Video games to the east and movies to the west.{cy}

{BLA,BO}Under a Manhole{bla,bo}~
{BLA,BO}
  After climbing down a metal ladder, you find yourself on
  a walkway beside a main of raw sewage.  The smell is
  awful, you gag a little looking down into the waste. The
  tunnel is at a bend here, it leads to the north and to
  the east.
