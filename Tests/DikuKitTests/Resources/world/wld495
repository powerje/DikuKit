{Y}A Cliff overlooking the Ocean{y}~
{Y}
  Out on the horizon, the sunlight bounces
  along the wake of a passing ship. Gulls
  fly overhead and the fin of a whale peeks
  out of the water. The breeze brushes the 
  dune grass and scatters sand. The short 
  trees offer little shade except to the 
  small sparrows which perch on their branches
  to escape the heat. The waves below crash 
  with a gentle thunder that leaves the cliff
  with a peaceful feeling.

{Y}A steep path{y}~
{Y}
  Hold on tight! The handrails are here 
  with good cause. This steep, slippery 
  slope leads right to the beach. With
  hands full of beach chairs, sun block, 
  and towels, it is no wonder that people
  have fallen. The plants on either side 
  of the path are neatly cut so that they 
  do not block the way.

  Closer to the water, the sand is damp. Some 
  shells have been abandoned here along the water's
  edge. Small clams, mermaid purses, and mussels
  lay in a ribbon along the coast from one end of 
  the beach to the other. Wouldn't it be wonderful
  to gather a few and take them home?

  White, soft sand reflects the light of the bright
  sky. During the day, the sand is hot, but at night,
  the sand's warmth is welcoming. The beach is a 
  popular relaxation spot for many. On holidays, it's 
  nearly impossible to be at peace here. There
  are just way too many people gathered here. It is 
  best to enjoy the beach on the off-seasons.

  Tucked out of sight and sheltered from the hot sun,
  this small warm cave is very cozy, a perfect place
  to hide.  The sandy bottom slopes towards the water,
  but the angle of the cave prevents the tide from
  reaching here, except during big storms.  The rough,
  shadowy walls of the cave conceal hundreds of small
  etchings made by others who have found this place.

  grows  here, tended by natives and  surviving

  Lurking amongst the exposed rocks of low tide
  are sea urchins with spiny backs and gooey 
  centers. These orange, yellow, and pink creatures
  dwell amidst the starfish and sunfish found in this 
  shore hugging pool. Mussels and feather dusters 
  cling to the salty rocks as the starfish crawl
  over them looking for a tasty, accessible morsel.

  The high tide pounding against the rocky hill
  for so long has carved a nook. The water-beaten 
  rock is smooth and gray like the boulder that 
  sits west of it. This little-used beach has
  kept this hollow a secret place for quite 
  some time.

{C,BO}Pet Central{c,bo}~
{Y}
  It smells like cedar shakes in here.
  Hamsters, guinea pigs, and mice squeak
  noisily on the east wall of the shop.
  Birds perch on the giant tree in the
  center of the room and converse with
  one another. Near the back of the shop
  puppies are penned up awaiting new homes.
  Oddly enough, the kittens, rabbits, and 
  chinchillas share a more open area near 
  the check out counter. There are 5 isles 
  of pet supplies here as well.

{B,BO}A Secret Passage{b,bo}~
{BL,BO}  
  This small narrow vent is just large 
  enough for two people to squeeze through.
  At one end is the Pet Shop and at the
  other end is Benson's Tavern.

{R,BO}Assassin's Chamber{r,bo}~
{R,BO}
  This is the perfect place for an assassin 
  to hide. This room is lit by the cracks in the 
  window shades. The wall has the names of 
  many assassins carved into it. A worn bed 
  sits in the corner of the room. Seems as 
  though some spent more time here than they
  had anticipated. Time has been marked on 
  the wall with a burnt stick. Hopefully, 
  this is just a stomping ground and not a 
  final resting place. Good luck!

{M}Benson's Tavern{m}~
{M}
  Pushing through the heavy wooden doors, the 
  long varnished counter comes into view. The 
  lights are dimmed. A few candlelit sconces
  adorn the oak panelled walls. Oversized tables
  sit near the center of the room. Smoke lingers
  in the air and the stench of fresh, home-style
  brews fill the room. The windows have been 
  blacked by solid shutters. A pool table sits
  in the corner of the room. The customers look
  friendly enough.
