Gates to Mortal Kombat~

   You stand before the large gates of a
   mysterious and gloomy fortress. From within
   the castle, screaming of anguish and immense
   pain can be heard. Do you dare take the chance
   and enter this realm?  Do you value your life?
   Let the weak at heart know that this is no
   place for them.  Only the brave and cunning
   will survive here!!  So enter and become a true
   warrior or step back and save a life, which
   could be your own!  Be BRAVE and fight wisely.

               MORTAL KOMBAT!

Realm of The Brave~

   Congratulations!! You have just stepped one
   step closer to your DOOM! Either you are a
   very brave and skilled warrior or you are a
   VERY foolish mortal who has no care for his
   life (not to mention his equipment). Oh well,
   none the less, you have chosen to journey on
   into Mortal Kombat.  As you can see, there
   are exits all around EXCEPT back from where
   you entered.  You are TRAPPED.  So you have
   no choice but to choose a path.  Beware, O 
   noble one, for each path leads to characters
   of immense strength and skill.  Kintaro, the 
   master of the Four Arm Attack, Scorpion, The
   Revengeful Spirit, Sub-Zero, The ice cold ninja,
   and Shao Kahn, Ruler of The Realm of the
   Underworld, just to name a few. Be not afraid
   for you can not turn back now!! Go Forward!!

Entrance to a Cold and Icy Cave~
  
  
  Shivers run up and down your spine as you
  come to the mouth of this enormously huge
  hole.  As you attempt to move forward you
  feel a cold draft blow up against your cheek.
  At this point you feel as though maybe you're
  going in the wrong direction. As you listen
  closely you can hear the screams of people
  coming from inside the cave.  Then all of
  a sudden, the screaming comes to a complete
  halt as you hear the sound of something being
  ripped off from its body.  Just as you hear
  this you again feel the cold breeze coming 
  from inside.

Deeper into the Icy Cavern~
  
  
  As you journey deeper into the cavern, you
  begin to hear the screaming again coming
  from within the depths of the cave. Though
  this time they seem a lot louder. You shudder
  as the screams pierce your ears.  What 
  horrible thing could make someone scream like
  that?  I'm sure you dont want to find out.  
  But your curiosity beckons you to move onward.
  Again that all familiar breeze of fresh air
  gusts in from the west.  Your curiosity grows
  as does your fear. Turn back now?  Well, the
  choice is yours.  Good luck!!

Before the Freezer~

   You have come to the entrance to of a large
   freezer!!  Wow... look at the size of this 
   thing.  As you look around you hear the 
   screaming coming from inside the freezer.
   You wonder what is going on in there?  But
   you notice thank there is a big blue
   Abominable Snowman guarding the entrance.
   He grunts at you, letting you know that you
   are not welcome here. Do you really wanna know 
   what is inside this Freezer?  Is finding out 
   where the screaming is coming from THAT 
   IMPORTANT?  If so you must get past this 
   immense guardian.   Then again, you have no
   choice.  Banzai!

LAIR OF SUBZERO~

   That all familiar cold breeze engulfs your body
   as you enter The Freezer! As you begin to look
   around you notice a man clothed in blue sitting
   in the middle of the room.  He looks totally 
   insane as he rips the head of an unfaithful
   servant taking the spine as well.  As the body
   of the servant falls to the ground you feel that
   you really didn't want to know what made the
   screaming sound. As you try to find a way to
   escape the blue-masked ninja, Subzero, he looks
   your way and grins an evil grin.  He yells "Bring
   that thing over here" as he points his finger
   towards YOU!!!!  You then notice that all the 
   people around you look as if they all are ready to
   eat.  Are you the main course?   Subzero cackles 
   as he says "More ribs for me! Muhahahaha!" Sorry
   this was by invitation only. You WILL pay the 
   price!  Fight with Honor!

Cavern of Lost Souls~
  
  
  As you enter the cave an immense heat wave 
  goes right through your body.  As this happens
  you feel the sorrow of millions of souls in
  distress.  You begin to tear as the visions
  of their sorrow run through your mind. You 
  wonder what is the purpose of this area? 
  Then someone whispers to you "We have lost our 
  way. Can you help us?"  As soon as the
  whispering stops the crying begins again. You
  feel curious as to what lies ahead.  Why all
  this pain and sorrow?  You must find out.

Purgatory Chamber~
  
  
  You have come to the Chamber of Purgatory. 
  You notice that this room is also one of
  sorrow.  The wailing is more intense here
  than in the Caverns!  As you listen closely
  you hear the words "I DON'T BELONG HERE!!!
  LET ME OUT!!!". Following this you hear a
  loud laughter coming from THE SPIRIT floating
  on the ceiling.  The SPIRIT says "YOU CAN'T 
  GET OUT SO DON'T COMPLAIN!".  It then becomes
  mysteriously quiet.  The wailing then increases
  AGAIN.  You wonder if what the SPIRIT says
  refers to you? Uh-oh i think you're in trouble!
  I don't think HE will let you leave!!

  is not what you would consider to be comfortable.
  You sweat and see nothing but flames all over.
  Where to go?  No one knows.  Use your brain.

   lengthened.  As you look around you see nothing
   but lava and flames.   Have a happy stay here!

Right Outside The Gates of Hell~

   You have found the Gates of Hell... CONGRATULATIONS?  
   The pure black gates have a creepy look to it.  Not
   to mention the GORGON guarding the gate.  He snarls
   at you, letting you know that you are not wanted here.
   Luckily for you, he is chained to the gate.  But you
   notice that there is a key tied around the Gorgon's 
   neck.  *SIGH*  I guess if ya wanna go in there you 
   have to take it from him.  Boy, is that a task!!!
   Oh well, it's up to you whether you journey on or
   stop here.  Be BRAVE!!!!!!!

   You are a true warrior.  Not many have passed
   the Gorgon and lived to talk about it.  Well,
   you still are not done.  There is much to see.
   As you look north, you see a huge castle glowing
   with a RED AURA.  Though it is a while away,
   the AURA from the castle can be seen very clearly.
   Go forth and fear nothing!!!

Intersection~

   You have come to an intersection in the path. 
   As you look to the west and east you can see
   the jail facilities that are big enough for 
   only two people.  You wonder why would you 
   need jails in Hell?  Oh well, again to the
   north is the Castle of the Underworld and
   to the south is the Road to the Underworld.

On The Path to Jail~

   The gravel path leads both east and west. 
   To the west is the jail facility and to 
   the east is the intersection.  You still
   are curious as to why they would put a 
   jail in Hell, isn't Hell punishment enough?
   I guess they don't feel that there is such
   a thing as enough pain.  You notice that 
   there are houses to the north and the south
   but they look unoccupied. It'd be best to
   leave them alone.

  You come to the entrance of the Almighty Jail.
  However, it doesn't look so almighty. The only
  Bailiff seems to agree with you for he has a 
  look of boredom etched upon his face. Though
  he looks to be a very responsible person because 
  he is still standing his post. You wonder who 
  could he be guarding in there?  As you attempt 
  to open the cell the Bailiff slaps your hand and
  tells you that you can't go in there.  The 
  Bailiff grins and says "It's for your own Safety!",
  as he checks to make sure that the cell is securely
  locked.  Again your curiosity bugs you to see 
  what is in the jail.

Inside the Cell~
  
  
  Why, oh why did you let temptation get the
  best of you?  Now you are stuck here with
  a weirdo with a metal plate on his head and
  a red glowing eye located on the right side 
  of his head.  The eye seems to be part of 
  his headgear as if he is some sort of robot.
  As you stare at him and notice that his name
  is etched on the top of his metal device. 
  It reads "KANO"!  You then realize that he
  was the supposedly mythical thief who had
  powers within his headgear which allowed him 
  to be the great thief that he was. But if 
  he is so great then why is he captured?  
  Hmm a greater being exists?  As you turn
  to go back out Kano blocks your way and 
  says "Where do ya think your going huh?  
  I want out and you are my ticket outta here!"
  You panic and realize that the only way out 
  is to fight him.  Hope he isn't as good as
  legend makes him to be.

   you should leave alone. This road is so 
   peaceful.  It is hard to believe that
   this is the Underworld.

Inside the Cell of Sonya~

   As you enter the cell you see a tall, blond
   beauty clad in army apparel which is torn to
   shreds.  By the ware and tear of her clothes you 
   assume that she has been here a while.  As you
   gaze into her eyes you sense that she is very
   dangerous even if she is very beautiful.  She
   has a spark that tells you she is something
   special.  As you look around you see her name
   located on her military id chain.  It reads SONYA!
   As you attempt to leave she blocks your way 
   and says,  "You can't leave here without being 
   punished!!!  You're one of THEM!!!"  You sigh.

  the beauty of this house that ignore your 
  instincts. Just as you look towards the 
  fireplace of the house you hear a *SNAP*.
  You hope and pray that it was something other
  than the chain that is holding back the 
  Watch Dogs *GULP*  As you turn to see if the
  chain is still intact, you immediately receive
  the answer when you are pounced upon by the
  three watch dogs. You should have listened to
  your instincts. Too late now.  You have no
  choice but to battle onward!!

Before the Gates of the Underworld Realm~
  
   
  You finally have arrived at the gates of
  the great kingdom of the Underworld. You 
  are a bit winded from the journey and almost
  faint when you notice that the castle of the
  Underworld is located at the very top of this
  mountain. And you, my friend, are at the 
  bottom. Well if you choose to journey on,
  then you must climb upwards to continue. 
  The path looks both narrow and dangerous.
  Not to mention the weird feeling you get
  from the breeze drifting down the mountain 
  side. As you ponder whether you should go
  up or not, you notice that the entire mountain
  is enveloped in a gigantic BLOOD RED AURA.
  You hesitate to venture forth. The choice 
  is yours. Be Brave, Go Onward! As it is
  said, "This Journey is NOT for the weak at 
  heart!!"

You have come to the Gates of the Underworld Realm.  I assume you have come to
attempt to face Shao Kahn in Mortal Kombat!!  If so you should be warned that
there are four challenges to defeat in order to prove yourself worthy of even
being in the same room as Shao Kahn.  His minions are loyal and brave.  Be 
Brave. MORTAL KOMBAT!!!!!!!

   to the base of the mountain. You glance to 
   see how far the path up is and notice that
   the Castle looks like an ant from where you
   are. You have a ways to go! I hope you are 
   packed with the necessary supplies. You hear
   an evil laughter coming from the fog to the 
   north.  The path is indeed very narrow and 
   allows you to go in only one direction. 
   Which is NORTH!  Good Luck!!

Narrow Pathway~

   This narrow path seems to be covered by
   bones of warriors who dared attempt to
   conquer the castle of the Underworld. The 
   stench of rotten flesh lingers in the air.
   You almost feel like puking but are 
   interrupted by the same evil, hysterical 
   laughter you heard while at the base of 
   the the mountain.  You also hear screaming
   coming from the north.  The sounds of 
   blades clanking together can be heard from
   the fog.  What could it be?  Go find
   out.  Muhahahahah!!!

The First Challenge~
  
   
  As you arrive from the south, the smell of
  rotten flesh burns your nostrils as you
  inhale. The screaming is at its peak and
  as you look around you see the reason why.
  A distorted human-like figure stands on a
  pile of dead bodies while shredding the
  bodies of anyone who tries to get past him.
  His arms seem to have long sharp blades 
  protruding from his forearms. He sure 
  does look gruesome. While you are noticing
  him he turns and says "Go back or face the 
  same fate as all who try to pass the
  Mighty Baraka!!!  Muhahahahaha!"  Choose 
  your fate.

  WOW!!!! Congratulations!! You have gotten 
  past the first of many bosses on the road
  to the castle of The Underworld. The path
  continues to the east, but watch your step 
  for let me remind you that the path is very
  narrow.  Be happy that you got this far 
  and pray that your journey be successful!
  Is it your destiny to reach the top of 
  this dreaded mountain?  Only time will tell.

Smokey Pathway~
  
   
  The sky darkens as you enter this smoke
  filled room. It seems to be that the 
  source of this hideous fog is coming 
  from the east. You wonder where could
  all this smoke be coming from.
  Curiosity killed the cat, will it kill
  you? Journey forth to find out.

The Mystic Fog~
  
  
  Upon entering this room, you gasp at seeing
  a gigantic Grey Dragon munching on a few bodies.
  You notice that he is emitting a greyish smoke
  from his wings. He pays no attention to you as
  you try sneak past him. Whoops, how clumsy of 
  you to trip over his favorite bone. He glares
  at you icily as he growls his anger. Oh boy 
  are you in trouble.  I don't think he'll let
  you pass without a fight.  Be brave O Noble
  mortal, for if it's destiny for you to reach 
  the top, you will.

  The smoke seems to fill the room and make it
  almost impossible to see anything. As you 
  squint to look around, you notice that the 
  smoke tends to coming from a shadowy
  silhouette in the mist.  By the looks of 
  it, he seems to be blocking the stairway. 
  It bellows "You shall go no further!! Your
  trip ends here!!". Following his threat you
  notice that he takes a defensive stance,
  showing you that he means business. 
  *SIGH* And this is just the beginning.
  It beckons you on to battle.

Cavern of Lost Souls~
  
  
  As you enter the cave an immense heat wave 
  goes right through your body.  As this happens
  you feel the sorrow of millions of souls in
  distress.  You begin to tear as the visions
  of their sorrow run through your mind. You 
  wonder what is the purpose of this area? 
  Then someone whispers to you "We have lost our 
  way. Can you help us?"  As soon as the
  whispering stops the crying begins again. You
  feel curious as to what lies ahead.  Why all
  this pain and sorrow?  You must find out.

  wall. All show of a happy life. As you go

  saddened to find out that this person was
  assassinated without reason. HOW SAD. *SOB*  
  You can hear the moaning of a Soul coming
  from the east.

Inside the Den~
  
  
  You have come before a room that looks like
  a normal living room.  Except for the fact
  that it is VERY HOT AND STICKY.  There is a
  couch located in the middle of the room with
  a 25" color TV right in front of it.  To the 
  left of the couch is a small refrigerator. 
  As you look in the refrigerator you notice
  a lot of empty beer cans lying around inside.
  What a poor soul.  What kind of miserable life
  he must have lived to have become a alcoholic 
  in the afterlife. How Sad, the pictures in the 
  other room must have been of his life.  No
  wonder!.

A Yellow Bedroom~
  
  
  As you follow the moaning into this room, you
  notice that the room is totally YELLOW! Very 
  weird!!  Everything from the bed to the floor
  is colored yellow. As you look around, you see
  a large SCORPION guarding the closet to the north.
  You wonder, "What could be in there?"  As you 
  attempt to open the closet door, the scorpion
  blocks your way and says, "My master is very sad.
  He doesn't want to be bothered EVER!!!!"  As you
  look at the scorpion a little closer, you notice 
  that his stinger is very big and could do a lot 
  of damage to whomever he uses it on.  *GULP*  
  Well, it's up to you whether you want to go 
  into the closet<I sure wouldn't>..

Inside the Closet~

   You have found the source of the loud moaning.
   It comes from this man right here sitting on a
   bunch of boxes.  In one hand he has a can of Bud
   Ice while in the other hand he holds a vicious
   lookin' harpoon.  He seems to be mumbling something 
   to himself which sounds like "That damn Subzero!"
   But you can't quite be sure of what he is saying. 
   None the less, he is apparently very drunk and will
   go off if you do anything STUPID.  I advise you to
   stay clear of this guy for he is like a bomb just
   waiting to go off!!!

  is particularly narrow and very PINK. 
  The walls, the gravel, and even the Flowers
  on the sides are Pink. Flowers? On the path
  to the Underworld? Geez how strange and weird. 
  It seems as though this path is one of peace 
  and serenity as you take a moment to appreciate
  the area.  What type of challenge could a person
  who lives so neat and pretty, put up?  Journey 
  forth to find out.

   immensely pink room. It is so very bright
   and so very PINK. How could someone love
   this color THIS much. Everything in this
   room is identical to the previous one but
   just a bit brighter. You also notice the 
   draft coming from the west smells like a
   girls perfume. You almost are put in a 
   trance by the smell for it is so very 
   seductive. It beckons you to move onward!!

  The smell of the beautiful fragrance has led
  you to this chamber. Before you sits a girl 
  in front of a beauty mirror.  She is fixing
  her hair and looking quite sexy while doing it.
  Her body is that of an hourglass while her skin 
  looks to be as smooth as silk. It seems to move in
  slow motion as she turns her head to look at you.
  EEK!!  Her face definitely does not match her body. 
  Her teeth are as big as sharks and her eyes resemble
  that of a cat's.  She hisses at you and says, 
  "I'm having a bad hair day, do ya really wanna mess
  with me?"

  woman in skimpy blue tights, staring at you. 
  She seems to be very angry.  It is then that you
  realize that you have just killed her twin sister 
  *GULP*.  "Not a good idea", you think to yourself
  as you hear a fan unraveling.  The fan seems to
  look very dangerous and SHARP!!  She says, "My
  name is Kitana Montoya, you killed my sister, 
  prepare to die!!!!!"

   think to yourself "This is just too easy to just
   open the gate and go north. Why so easy? You then
   figure hmm maybe their giving me a break. Oh well..
   The only exits are north and south. There is a sign
   here that i think you should read. The sign glows 
   a bloody red.

   You enter a room that is about the size of a
   court room. Right in the middle of this room
   lies a long, huge, oak dinner table, big enough
   to hold about thirty guests. At the head of 
   the table you notice a large, highly decorated
   chair, that looks fit for a king. It is covered
   with jewels and gold.  Very impressive. Around 
   the room, there heads mounted upon plaques with 
   the date of which the Kill, was killed. Do you

A Dark Cavern~
  
  
  As you enter the room, you smell the all to
  familiar scent of rotting flesh. Looking around
  you see the reason for that smell. Piles and
  piles of decapitated bodies are laying about.
  This must be where they dispose of all the 
  bodies after they mount their heads on the 
  plaques. You hear the an evil laughter 
  echoing from all directions.

The Armory~

   The glare of the weapons on the wall seem to 
   temporarily blind you as you enter. Many of
   them are very much, covered with blood. In 
   the middle of the room you see a huge shrine
   which seems to emit lava. It seems to give off
   a thumping sound like that of a heartbeat. As 
   you look around you see the only exit to the 
   west. Upon the gate there lies a huge lock that
   has the name Master written on it. I think you
   need a key for that.  Now where could it be?

Before the Bridge of Faith~

   As you exit the gates, you come before a very
   unstable looking bridge. It is made entirely
   wood and has NO rails. It sways from side to
   side. The bridge is stretched across a pit,
   towards a cave on the other side. As you 
   look into the pit, you see many skeletons
   of warriors who have failed the test of faith
   and have fallen to their deaths and were
   impaled by the spikes. Have faith and believe
   that it was you who was destined to overthrow
   this beast known as Shao Kahn.

   It seems as if the pit beckons you to come 
   and join them. *SHIVER* The bridge

Land Ho!!!~

   You finally have reached land. You feel a 
   little bit safer but not much. Realizing
   that you are almost there your heart begins 
   to beat with excitement, and also with fear
   wondering weather or not these final rooms
   shall bring you glory or death.

Final Warning~

   You have reached the entrance to Shao Kahn'
   s Lair. A hint:  To the north is Goro, the 
   first of three bosses that you must pass 
   in order to reach your destiny <which is 
   Shao Kahn>.  Be courageous and fight with
   honor!!!

The Dungeon of Goro~
  
  
  This room is decorated with two skeletons 
  hanging by chains to the stone wall. The wall
  is composed of many stone boulders. As you 
  attempt to look around, you cannot help but 
  notice the 8'2" giant looking at ya. You notice 
  that he has four muscular arms that could do 
  a lot of damage to someone who doesn't know 
  what they're doing. Do you?  I hope so because
  this is the first challenge on the road to Shao 
  Kahn.

   Congratulations!! Beating Goro must have been
   no walk in the park!!! Just as you start to 
   feel happy about the win, you notice that
   there is a man hidden in the corner of the
   room.  His body seems to be changing its
   shape every second taking on a new form. He 
   points his finger at you beckoning you to do 
   battle with him!!! Go forward!!!

Before the Throne of Shao Kahn~
  
  
  You have arrived at the gates of Shao Kahn.
  The door is HUGE!! Looking around, you notice
  a sign over the door. It reads "The Doorway
  to Death". After reading this, the large being,
  guarding the door, says, "You are not worthy to
  even be in the same room as Shao Kahn, UNLESS
  you beat me!!!"  Well, i guess you know what
  to do know right?  Banzai!!!

   Here at last!! Congratulations <or should i say
   Farewell!>!! You have finally proven yourself
   worthy of the match of the century, between You
   and Shao Kahn. All i can say now is Good Luck and 
   Be Careful.  As you get ready for battle you can 
   hear the cheering of souls as they cheer YOUR name.
   They have been waiting for someone like you to 
   finish off Shao Kahn and set their spirits free. 
   If you fail, you'll probably be joining them!!!

   heavens while their leaves and branches block
   out most of the sunlight which tries to get in.
   You feel so comfortable here. It puts your soul
   at ease. It's a shame you can't stay here forever.

Deeper into the Icy Cavern~
  
  
  As you journey deeper into the cavern, you
  begin to hear the screaming again coming
  from within the depths of the cave. Though
  this time they seem a lot louder. You shudder
  as the screams pierce your ears.  What 
  horrible thing could make someone scream like
  that?  I'm sure you dont want to find out.  
  But your curiosity beckons you to move onward.
  Again that all familiar breeze of fresh air
  gusts in from the west.  Your curiosity grows
  as does your fear. Turn back now?  Well, the
  choice is yours.  Good luck!!

Entrance to the Heavens~

   As you enter the room you feel a strange sense
   of awareness overcome you. You feel as if you
   are in the middle of the universe. As you look 
   around you notice that you could be just that.
   In the middle of the universe. Stars are
   everywhere and you can see many planets floating 
   far from reach. While staring at the scenery for 
   a bit, you notice that there is a strange glow of
   white light coming from the north. The light seems
   to be emitting from the little asteroid in the distance.
