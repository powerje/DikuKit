Forge's Keep~
  You step into a room faintly illuminated.  Momentarily glancing down, you are
shocked to see that the emblem of {BOLD}{BLUE}FORGE{blue}{bold} covers the entire rotunda floor, with
the following enscription encircling it:

{RED}{BOLD}   With Sword and Dagger Thou I guard,
   Mine Honour and Life I offer Thee;

   With Blood and Sweat for Thou I work,
   Mine Heart and Soul I Vow to Thee.

Path leading up a huge mountain~
  You follow the dusty path along the mountain.  Dry sand is whipped into
your squinting eyes by strong winds that circle the mountain.  The walk
leads further up along towards the east, and back towards the huge sign to
the south.  The castle is less than an hour's climb from here.  Your only
goal is revenge and not to fail her as you did last time you walked this
path.

Path leading up the mountain~
  You continue following the path.  You hear water near by, and you can't help
feeling like taking a leak.  Too bad, maybe you should have done your stuff
back in the city before you came here.  At this point you wonder if you have
everything you need.  As you look up, a small beam of light shines down on
your face from the heavens.  A voice in your mind calms you and says to you,
"Good luck and God speed.  Do not forget me."

  You arrive at a sharp turn in the path up the mountain.  The path leads
further up to the north, and back down where you came from towards the west.
The soothing sound of water can no longer be heard, and life seems to have
been drained away from the surroundings by the forces within the citadel.
There is no sign here.

identify several distinct forms infront it.  Although the few torches that
light the entrace are dim, they are enough to sporadically flash the sharp
grins off the gleaming weaponry held by the gate sentinels.  You better

is a path along the castle walls towards the west and east.  Two huge
wooden torches at each side of the door burn evilly and mock your cowering
presence here again.  The trail leading down the mountain is to the south.

Eastward trail outside the castle walls~
  You are walking along a crooked path around the castle walls.  In other
senarios, you would imagine thick foliage, dark swampy mud, decaying trees,
screaming wildlife.  Here however, all you can see is darkness.  The only
wildlife you did see were a family of large rats savagely feasting on the
unfortunate ending of a similar beast.  The path continues west and east.
You feel uneasy as you see the silhouettes of shadows follow you.

your strong light fights to penetrate the solid blackness, you fail to see
far beyond you.  The only way you can get the faintest notion of where you
are is by feeling the stoney wall as you move.  You are afraid that leaving
the path would lead you into some unknown dangers.  The path continues west

South-east corner of the castle walls~
  You have reached the south-east corner of the walls.  You peak around the
corner, just to make sure no one is really following you; luckily, nothing
was there.  The path follows north and west from here.  To the north, the
shadows are gently pushed away by the dispersed light from some undetected
source.  However, darkness consumes your vision to the west, making it
almost impossible to see anything there.

  You sneak along the citadel walls with the experience of a seasoned thief.
Your eyes switch quickly between objects in your view.  These are only a few
of the skills that The Ancient has taught you.  These are but a few of the
keys you will need to survive.  Besides the his words echoing in your mind,
everything seems quiet... everything except for the occassional blood-freezing
occassional Yeeeeaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh... {plop!}  You wonder what the hell
is going on.  The trail leads north and back south.

can be heard from the south.  Even that is more comforting than the loneliness
you feel within you.  The trail leads north into a darker night and back

an urge to take a leak; but no matter how hard you try, you can't.  Perhaps
you shouldn't drink too much water anymore.  It would probably be a good
idea to maintain your reserves anyway... this would be a long mission, and
you may have to share your supplies with others.  You check your water just
to make sure you have enough, as water does have many uses other than for
drinking.  The path goes south and west from here.

the unknown presence.  To your horror, you turn around to face only the night,
its death-like calmness.  You panic to decide what you are to do next!

fallen out of the wall.  At first, you simply ignore them and curse for

It also seems to have been unevenly cropped.  Randomly scattered in the
area, there are remnants of life near-by.  Suprising, for such a death-
oriented settlement.  Several grunting noises can be heard from the north,
and a more quiet environment can be found to the south.

  The passage widens out a bit.  There are fewer foot prints here than the
other places.  Although you originally thought that you are alone, you
suddenly detect the brisk shuffling of feet behind you.  From the corner of
your eyes, you distinctly see a human-like form creeping amongst the shadows.
As you quickly turn around to face this menace, you see a faint silhouette
dart past you into the darkness to the south and beyond.  With its amazing
speed and agility, you doubt that you should investigate it further.  Was it
afraid of you?  Or is it waiting to catch you at the right instant?  The path
continues north and south.

distant light. Then you hear it.  You body refuses your training and it
freezes as your mind realizes what it could be.  Could it be the shadows?
Swinging around, you see nothing, but a swirl of dust illuminated by your
light slowly settling down at your feet.

lying about, you hope you remembered to lock your door when you went out
this morning.  Now you wonder whether you rememberd to floss three weeks
ago.  Somehow this place brings back your old memories and messes around
with your confidence.

inside to help them out right now!  Maybe you are lucky you aren't inside with
them though...

A small unholy temple~
  You are on the steps of what seems to be a small temple.  You can easily
tell that is is not holy from the various symbols and corpses lying around
here.  Sorta reminds you of a meat store after the inspector has gone
through it and graded each slab of beef...  You cautiously step over the
corpses and make your way onward...

The south-eastern corner inside the castle walls~
  You whistle "Hi ho hi ho, off to work we go..." originally sung by the seven
dwarves as you walk along the castle wall.  BONK!  You should concentrate a
little more when you walk.  Your face is now a perfect cast of the south-
eastern corner.  While rubbing your poor nose, you notice a flickering fire
to your north, and the gates into the castle grounds are to the distant west.

  The dust on the stone steps whisp away as you walk about.  It looks as if
they had lives as you do.  The air is arid... actually it is quite wet,
wet enough to make it weigh down your armor.  You reach for your dagger
and start scratching those soaking wet underarms of yours, and when you
are done, you notice that you've just shaved off half your body hair.

the sand, and you prepare to be surprised by anything that you may
encounter.  There is a small temple-like structure to your west, and

  A motley bunch sit around a fire.  Several goblins, dwarves, and the
like dance around and eating some stomache-turning chunks of meat.
Suddenly, to your left, you hear a blood-freezing scream and as you
spin around, you see a warty-faced orc impale his girl (?) friend in the
side with an evil looking dagger.  The others nod in agreement as they
applaud his actions.  In a matter of seconds, she has a stick shoved
through her and is roasted crispy over the fire...  Sorta give a new
meaning to "loving your girl" and "sharing" with your friends!

Along the west walls~
  You are following a wide alley along the west walls on the castle
grounds.  You remember back home.  There was an area similar to this
where you used to pretend to be a warrior.  You would go on long quests,
fight dragons, wizards, demons, and mercilessly slaughter the neighbour's
pigs.  Your dreams have become all too real now, and you wonder whether
you would have done so if you knew what you see today.  You also remember
falling heroically at the blades of several dozen demons, and you hope
that dream stays as it is... only a dream.
  There is a small temple to the south, and the street continues to the
north and east.

  The courtyards are huge.  In fact, it stretches far beyond your view
into the unwelcoming darkness.  Everything is quiet here, and you
cleverly deduce that the inhabitants of the inner castle don't stand
in the middle of no where all day like you are doing right now.  There
is a flame flickering to your east, and you realize that it must be the
main entrance into the castle.  To the south, there is a strange
looking temple, and the courtyards continue to the east and west.

multiple times, you wouldn't be able to open it or smash your way

hundreds of gargoyles carved around the doorway...  well, you hope

Further up, you see the reflection of a wicked flame perform a hipnotic
ritual on the wall.  You also see people, very politely, forming a line
from the west to the east.  At the head of the line, people are taking
strides out of the window, screaming their heads off, then disappearing
into the darkness below.  Not logical!  What are they trying to do?  Die?

you didn't notice it, but to the north there are steps reaching down
into darkness.  The air drifting upwards is warm and humid.  You can't

course, there is a wall to your east, so you can't go that way.

The corpse recycling bin~
  CRAAACK!  You snap the wrist of a young dwarven girl as you step into
the room.  Jumping back, you quickly apologize to the corpse at your feet
and you slowly turn your head up to face a shocking reality.  The room is
filled with the bodies of hundreds of brutally tortured and murdered
individuals.  Young, old, male, female, hairy, bald, thirsty, and non-
thirsty.  You fall to your knees (and snap her other wrist) and mourn for
the victims.  After a moment of tears, you realize there was nothing you
could have done, except for the fact that you failed on your last mission.
You cannot fail them again!
  You wipe the tears, sweat, and drool from your face and you spy a
large food processor obviously used to recycle the corpses into plant
fertilizer, animal food, or maybe, food.  You see several arms being
mashed about in it.

In the torture chamber~
  The instruments here are horrid!  This is another room designed for the
special purpose of inflicting pain onto the bodies of many.  It looks like
this room is dedicated to the fingers, hands, toes, and hands.  A corpse
strapped to the table clearly demonstrates this.  Numerous tools lay by
this poor body, and several are found forced under his finger and toe
nails.  You imagine what they can do to your nerves!  Wait, he's still
alive!  Probably helps to torture someone who's living anyway.

The shrine of the Hypnotist~
  The walls open to a small room lit by candle and torch light.  Cautiously
you sneak inside and see a strange shrine.  In the middle of the room sits
a low platform on which perches a huge stone creature.  With the body of a
small dragon and the neck and snake of an ostrich.  A very interesting
sight... too interesting that you look deep into its crimson stone eyes.
  Infact, now you know why it is called the shrine of the hypnotist.  You
join the line of hypnotized persons and follow them... out the window...

  The anguished groans of tormented bodies resonant in the halls.  You
recall the stories your teacher told you.  He had attempted to penetrate
this fortress when it fell into the hands of evil.  He told you and your
partner how he had been captured, beaten, humiliated, tortured, and almost
executed here.  Had it not been for your beloved, he would have died.  On
your attempt, your beloved had fallen at the hands of evil, her body and
sould only existing in your memories.  She had died to save you, and you
dare not fail anyone, anymore, for the pain of failure is too great for
anyone to carry, twice.

  The sound of metal striking metal grows to an unbearable intensity.
You arrive at a smoke-filled room where several giants hammer away at
ridiculously vicious weapons: claws, chains, triple-edged blades, saws,
hand-grenades, egg-beaters, fly-swatters, nut-crackers, toilet paper,
and other things you have never seen or used before.  There is a huge

is the room from which the metal-metal banging originates.  To the south, you

  As soon as you sneak into the room, a blinding light hits you in the face.
As your eyes adjust, you realize that it is not the room that is extra
bright, but that you were just walking in around in dimly lit rooms for so
long.  Finally, you are able to look around.
  In a corner, there is a smoldering pile of corpses, releasing deadly gases
into the air.  You pull out a stick of deodorant from your backpack and
quickly apply it to the corpses.  Whewww... a few more minutes standing
around here and you would have joined them!
  To the side, hidden by the light, you see a huge guillotine!  In the other
corner, there is a rack of heavy swords stained with dark red blood!  On
the table below it, there are numerous daggers!  A shiver runs up your spine
as you realize that these are machinery designed for the termination of
life!  You have reached the execution room!

You step into the danger room...

Something obliterates YOU out of existence with its hit.

That REALLY did HURT!
You wish that your wounds would stop BLEEDING that much!

You are incapacitated and will slowly die, if not aided.

You are dead!  Sorry...

Lucky it was just a simulation, and Forge flicks the switch and you are

Forge's storage room~
  You have entered Forge's storage room...  and you are surprised that it's
rather clean!  Anyway, there are weapons, armour, and other devious devices
sorted alphabetically and in ascending order according to mass.  Oh well,
I guess engineering life has really gotten to him... *sigh*
