Magrons Workroom~
  You are in a comfortable, medium sized efficency apartment.  The room holds
a lovesized seat sofa, a chair, a bed, TV, BoomBox, and VCR.  A good sized
japanime collection shares a small bookshelf with software boxes.  On a 
wooden table sits a pretty decent computer system.  A 486 DX4/100 with 32
MB RAM, 2mb Diamond Viper VL video card driving a 21" Sony multisync monitor.
The heart of the system is an Adaptec 2842 32 bit SCSI adaptor connected to
a 1 GB Fujitsu HDD and a Kodak Exabyte 2.5 GB streaming SCSI tape backup.
A 3 1/2" FDD, a NEC 4x CDRom and a U.S. Robotics 14.4 Sportster modem complete
the picture.  A door to the bathroom, and a fair sized kitchen area with
table and chairs share the N wall of the room.
