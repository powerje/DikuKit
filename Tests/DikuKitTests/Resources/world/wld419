Escape Tunnels~

  The tunnels  are barely big  enough for two people to get
  through at one  time.  It  is  muddy  and  dark in  here, 
  making travel difficult. Sloshing through the muddy floor
  on your knees, you are thankful that it is cool in here.

An upward slope in the Escape Tunnels~

  A gentle  slope might  be  an  understatement for the
  tunnel now goes straight  up  into the  darkness.  An
  old, fraying, moldy rope hangs out from the darkness.

Escape Tunnel Exit~

  You feel a breeze on your face as you get to the tunnel
  exit, but you  are  unsure  which way to go,  since the
  breeze comes from two  different  directions.  You must
  choose the right path to the outside, so choose wisely.

Glen in the Woods~

  Breaking free of the briars at  the tunnel exit,  you stumble
  out into a glen. Sunlight shines through the gnarled branches
  and leaves of the  trees around you.  It would be a beautiful
  spot to sit and rest if it  wasn't for the slimy,  black mold
  that covers just about everything in sight.

Talloren River~

  You find yourself being carried along a  swiftly moving
  current.  Dark,  ominous  trees  line  the river banks.
  Their branches drag the water as if they were trying to
  reach out and grab you.  Unseen  things  brush  against
  your legs as you struggle  to  keep your head above the
  icy reddish-brown waters.

  Gasping for air, you find yourself dumped into a pool of
  ankle-deep, icy cold water.  Strangely  shaped  icicles,
  sparkling with a sickening  greenish glow hang overhead.
  The only  sound is  that of the  rushing  freezing water
  above you.

  The pool gives way to a small waterfall just ahead. The
  soft pounding of the water below tells you that it is a
  small one.  You  can  go  back east  to the icy pool or
  simply brace yourself for a wild ride down.

  waters.
