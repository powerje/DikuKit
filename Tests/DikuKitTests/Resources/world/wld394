  {W}{BOLD}This is a simple brick building with black-stained glass doors
  from which you can hear beautiful music.  A simple neon sign a few feet
  above the doors says "{w}{C}{BOLD}Musicland{c}{W}{BOLD}".
  This actually might be a good place to check out, at least if you have
  any love for music.

  {R,BO}You are standing in the center isle of musicland with exits
  leading everywhere.  The floor is made of a beautiful blue marble and the
  walls are painted a pure white.  All around you are all shelves of all
  kinds of music.  From sheet music, to tapes, CD's, musical instruments, as
  well as all sorts of music accessories.  All around you are normally what
  one would call customers.  But wait!  They all look like...notes?!{r,bo}

  constantly chewing gum.  Every line seems to be packed with customers and

  {Y,BO}This side isle seems to be dedicated to old, even ancient,
  sheet music.  All of the sheet music here is classical in
  nature and was written by some of the most famous musical
  talents of all time.  There are works from such artists as:

  {C,BO}Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750){c,bo}
  {C}Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827){c}
  {C,BO}Wolgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791){c,bo}

  {Y,BO}Such works by these artists include the following:

  {C,BO}Suite Number One in G Minor{c,bo}
  {C}Moonlight Sonate{c}
  {C,BO}Requiem "Dies irae"{c,bo}

  continue to stare in wonder at all the items, both normal,

  isn't a normal music store.  Ahead of you see games being
  played on giant TV's which hang from the ceiling as well as
  a flash of light which might indicate something other than a
  game.  Far to the east you can smell something familiar, but
  you can't quite make out what it is.{r,bo}

  the more you begin to appreciate what this isle, and even store, 
  has to offer you; a genuine sense of peace and solitude.  Serene 
  quiet overcomes you and seems to beg of you to read more of the
  well written historical notes, texts, and pamphlets that are
  available for free.  It seems to you, now, that you're all alone
  in this part of the store.  Perhaps it is because of the eerie
  sense of serenity, or, maybe it is something else...{y,bo}
