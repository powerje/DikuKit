as a genetic experiment. He comes complete with a self-destruct 
feature, a scorpion-like tail that opens up to absorb the energy
of his opponents, and instructions to wreak revenge on the 
Androids which caused Dr. Gero's downfall. Cell contains the DNA
of the mightiest warriors of the universe including Goku, Piccolo
and Vegeta. Possessing the DNA of these great warriors, Cell is 
able to fight with their attacks. With these great forces combined
Cell is an almost invincible being. One of his greatest advantages
is being able to regenerate at any given time from even the 
smallest component of himself. He gains power by draining the 
energy of his enemies using his scorpion-like tail.

formed, he now has an actual mouth. The two off-shooting sections
of his head now go straight into the air, as well. In this form,
he is at his 2nd largest with his height being more than double
that of Vegeta. His tail is longer than before, and protrudes
from his back, as well as becoming orange and black. His voice
is deeper than his previous form. The back of his head and the
black section on his forehead are now formed together as a ball
in between the two sections on his head. His lips are now the
color pink, and the black sections above his lips look like a 
mustache (except it is part of his skin). He now has blue eyes
in this form. He even has feet like shoes in this form and metal

{BO,Y}Trunks{bo,y}~

Trunks is the son of Bulma - a headstrong, technical genius - 
and Vegeta - one of the most powerful fighters in the Dragon 
Ball Z universe. His exact age is not certain, but he first
appears in Dragon Ball Z as a teen. He is from the future and 
has witnessed a threat to Earth which cannot be stopped. He has
come back in time to try to save the future Earth, only to find
our heroes in Earth facing their own peril.

{BO,G}Goku{bo,g}~

Goku is the hero of Dragon Ball Z, the most powerful warrior on
Earth. When the Saiyans arrive, Goku learns the mysterious
secret of his own past: he is a Saiyan formerly named Kakarot.
Goku was sent to Earth as a baby to destroy the planet, but a
head injury as a child scrambled Goku's programming. Instead of
growing up to become a destructive super-warrior, he became
innocent and pure of heart, fighting for good. Goku is peaceful, 
good natured, honest, loving to his family and friends, loyal, 
trustworthy, and brave. If he has a weakness, it is his trusting 
nature. He always finds the good in people when others don't see
it, though Goku's enemies sometimes take advantage of his naive
trust.
