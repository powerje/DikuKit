Snake Dungeon~

   This room, too, is made from the inside of a giant dead snake! Dirt has
   built up to form the floor, and you don't want to know what may be
   making that crunching noise under your feet!
   This room features a near-maze of white stone blocks, inexplicably
   clean! You can see the glint of something on the floor in the center of
   the maze. The only visible exit is west.
