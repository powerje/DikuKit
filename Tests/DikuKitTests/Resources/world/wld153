Lufy's Private Pillow Palace~
You are standing in a comfortable little room where Lufy stores her famous
pillows. A merry fire crackles in a fireplace set in the wall, throwing light 
a painting of a tiger on the far wall.  In the corner you see a bar where
strawberry daquiris can be made.  Dominating the room, however, are the rows
upon rows of pillows of every size and shape.  You can tell that Lufy knows
her pillows.  :)

Endrick's Laboratory~
This is the room where Endrick creates his mobs and objects.
There are pieces of animals you have never seen before littering
the floor.  Strange mishappen shapes, you can make out a wing over
here and an almost too human looking arm. There are bits of broken
armor and weapons too, some glowing and others just jagged.
 
Surveying this mess you wonder what End's real room looks like!

Endrick's bedroom~
 
This is a place where you are free to do as you please.  There is
nothing better to do here than to relax and be at peace.
 
There is a large bed that takes up the middle of the room with
a very comfortable looking mattress and warm blankets.
 
Lay back and enjoy the wonderful feeling you get from being here.
 
Downstairs, you see what looks to be a world of its own.  Warmth and
love eminate from there.

Endrick's private world~
As you take in the vastness of this place, you notice how the sunlight bathes
everything around you in a warm, golden hue.  The grass under your feet gives
way as you stroll around in awe at your surroundings.  You take a deep breath
and smile as the scent of sweet smelling flowers fill your senses.  You hear
the gentle gurgling of a clear river and the distant roar of a waterfall
flowing over a majestic cliff with water deep enough for you to dive into or
swim in all day long.  The trees sway slightly as a warm breeze blows through
the forest and the birds sing a song of joy and love for all things.  You 
can't help but feel relaxed in this beautiful atmosphere because everything
around you is alive with a spirit and harmony of its own.

{RED}{BOLD}Behind {YELLOW}{BOLD}the {RED}{BOLD}Counter{red}{bold}~


{YELLOW}{BOLD}There's that guy who wouldn't give you what you wanted, how you
wanted it.  He's got a half dead expression on his face like he's
been working here too long.  You almost feel sorry for him, but
it's too late!  He's gonna die!{yellow}{bold}

{RED}{BOLD}The {YELLOW}{BOLD}Drive {RED}{BOLD}Thru{red}{bold}~


{YELLOW}{BOLD}All this action going on around.  Two employees are working back here
as fast as they can as cars zoom by the drive thru window picking
up their food.  The manager's office is to the north.  Might want
to lodge a complaint about the service you have seen here, and
those awful bathrooms!{yellow}{bold}

{RED}{BOLD}Hallway {YELLOW}{BOLD}to {RED}{BOLD}Manager's {YELLOW}{BOLD}Office{yellow}{bold}~


{YELLOW}{BOLD}There is a hallway to the east that leads back to the hole where
{RED}{BOLD}McDonalds {YELLOW}{BOLD}makes its wonderful food. <puke> It doesn't smell
very good as you approach.  You wonder just how it is they make
the food here, then realize maybe you don't want to know!{yellow}{bold}

{YELLOW}{BOLD}Manager's {RED}{BOLD}Office{red}{bold}~


{YELLOW}{BOLD}You made it. You are now face to face with the man who runs this
place and all he's doing is counting money. He is not even going to 
look up at you. What kind of place is this? Their service is lousy 
and now that you have had a look at the grill you never want to eat 
at {RED}{BOLD}McDonalds{red}{bold} {YELLOW}{BOLD}again!{yellow}{bold}
