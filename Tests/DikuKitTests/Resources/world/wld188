{RED}Hell Maze{red}~

  You find yourself on a granite slab-like platform that appears to
  hang suspended in the air. An intense, amber parhelic ring blazes
  across the sky, engulfing you. A rolling, hueless sea of clouds, two
  hundred feet below the slab in which you are perched, deaden the
  enviroment. Upon your entrance, the clouds begin to thrash like
  thunderheads concealing the earth, from horizon to horizon.

  Peeking to the north, you are alarmed to see large pulsating lights
  blinding your vision. As you eyes adjust you see stretches of 
  computer constituents lines up in rows, emitting a muffled hum.

  To the east, you hear the voices of people engaging in sportive
  chatter. From the sound of clanking glasses, and ample belly laughs,
  it seems as though the jovial group is enjoying a few drinks. Hey!
  You think you are going to like this place.

  Upon entering this shrine, you bow your head in a moment of silence
  and feel a sudden rush of pride. Before you stands a finely crafted
  tombstone, dedicated to those Spawn who endured death, defending
  HELL in the name of anarchy. The champion warriors who lay peacefully
  in this monument deserve your utmost respect. They have paved the path
  of destruction, terror and chaos for you to follow. Be fearless, but
  wise in battle, for you must uphold the standards of Hell Spawn.

  You stand in the bowels of a brilliantly lit room. Many large
  human-size tubes are radiating an unfamiliar cerulean light.
  To your right, a small circular panel sits. The panel is
  illuminated by a subdued red light is the ceiling above you.
  Curiously, you gaze up at it.

 You smile, thinking to yourself, now this is a nice change of pace,
 especially after a daily action-packed raid, or the perennial 
 slaughter of mobs. Laughing and muffled chatter can be heard up 
 the hallway.

 A drunken mutant comes waddling towards you. before you can
 react, he is throwing up all over your leather boots!
 Who is this moron?
 
 As he looks up at you with a grin infested with his lunch, his badge
 reads 'Forge'. What a barbarian!

 You have entered a long, narrow passageway, naked of fixtures or
 character. The only indication that you are approaching the 
 reservoir of Hell Spawn supplies is a small indefinite quantity of 
 droplets. The droplets vary only in color, one a chocolate brown,
 and another a pale green..

You think to youself, Hmmm... I wonder what is up there?

 As you enter the room, you hear nothing but tortured screams and
 shrieks coming from all directions. In one direction you hear
 thumps of bodies as people are being gassed to sleep, while in
 the other direction, you hear the bending of iron, platinum and limbs.

 You notice a sign hovering just below the ceiling. You wonder if you

   This is the Demon Nesting Ground, where we breed demons and
   slaughter them for their hearts. From the blood of these
   blasphemous enchanted hearts we create the brand of the Hell
   Spawn, that Hellion warriors and mages alike feature. 

   The Demon with  glistering olive eyes eternally stands guard of
   these most-valuable hearts as well as Hell Spawn's quantum of
   gold.

{BOLD}{BLACK}
   When you enter {RED}Laya's Bondage Chamber {BLACK}your mind becomes soft
   like jello and you have a sudden will to submit. You are amazed at
   all the leather...on the couch, on the bed, in her closet, and well
   just about everywhere. 

   You now  know why it's a bondage chamber as you see a broken
   down bed, and not from age. The black sheets and shackles give
   you a provoking insight into {RED}Laya's {BLACK}more specialized interests. 
   
   Now you just want to sit around and wait for {RED}Laya {BLACK}to return to
   practice a little {BLINK}{WHITE}BONDAGE{blink}{BLACK}!!!

{BO,Y}({g}{R}HELL{BO,Y}){g}{R} Hell Spawn {W}Comfort Inn{g}~
  The first thing that strikes you in this room is the 
 overwhelming stench of death. Glancing around, the room
 seems quite plain...for a Hellion. There are two altars 
 on one side of the room, awaiting the daily sacrifices of
 enemy flesh to Forge and Rygar. On the opposite side of 
 the room there is a large oddly colored ornate waterbed. 
 Approaching the waterbed, you begin to realize why the room
 smells so bad...It seems that the bed itself is filled with
 the blood and eyeballs of the slain foe of the one who 
 dwells here. How nice...Upon the wall rest a Group portrait
 of some of {BO,Y}({g}{R}HELL{BO,Y}){g}'s elite members. Next to it hangs a long 
 silver framed piece of parchment. Examining the parchment 
 you see it is a list of rival clan members who have fallen
 to the iron fist of {R}HELL{g}. There seems to be plenty of room
 at the end for more names. A sign seems to be hovering 
 above the waterbed....hmm...

{BLACK,BOLD}This room appears to be nothing more than an old Tavern but to your dismay
it has been very well kept. The floor is made of marble tile that is so spotless you 
can see your reflection, the rest of the room is clean also but you see no one here.
It looks almost deserted. You keep checking out this wonderful place you have found
and you spy a couch that seems to be in the shape of a {BLUE}VODKA{BLACK} bottle, its neat
and looks very comfortable. You keep looking and you see the bar which is very well
stocked, it has lots and lots of {BLUE}VODKA{BLACK} bottles, as you walk over and look at the
bottles it seems whoever printed the labels liked the colors blue and white cause
when you read the label it reads {WHITE}SKYY{BLUE} VODKA{BLACK}. Thinking to yourself you think this
room is kewl and kicks ass and you would love to show your friends this place and
meet whomever {WHITE}SKYY{BLACK} is.

   A Comm who aids in zone creation,
   Who simplifies MUD complications,

glad to announce the completion of the shrine to Rygar

longer do the people of NC have to pray alone in 
scattered rooms throughout the MUD.  Instead, all can 
come and worship here, together, and to the most 
powereful deities in the history of Midgaard.  This is
truly the greatest day NC has ever witnessed."

   You step into a vacuum and instantly your body begins to react

   large mechanical hands strap you into a spacesuit and begin to
   depressurize your body... You have accidently walked into Buzz's
   Docking Bay without the proper space-gear, a big big NO NO!
   You examine the room, and realize this is where Buzz keeps all of
   the neat little gadgets he's always fiddling with. To the right
   you see a VERY LARGE weapons compartment full of blaster rifles,
   thermal detonators, and much more of the latest technology NCMUD
   technicians have to offer. 
   It seems Buzz is ready for WW VII, when {BO,Y}({bo,R}HELL{BO,Y}){BO,BLA} goes to war with

here you can kill pigs, which give good gold and good exp for level

and give better experiance for higher levels. But menehunes are harder

kill hermit.2u. kill hawaiian warriors. kill king
*IMPORTENT* Go in groups of 2 or three avatars, and when killing the
warriors, DO NOT ASSIST. ONLY ONE PERSON CAN FIGHT THE WARRIORS OR
ELSE ALL THE WARRIORS WILL JOIN IN AND SLAUGHTER YOU. The warriors are
fairly easy, but the king can be difficult. If you blind, dispel and
guinness him, he is much easier. Pummel him and quaff lots. He switches
if you dont blind him.

Ok, hawaii is a good place to get get money, and experience. Pigs give good gold
good exp for level 30's to 40's. Menehunes are a little harder but they
give better gold and a heal potion. I suggest groups of 2 or 3 non
avatars for menehunes.

The Inside of a Cow~
This place is very confining, pitch black, and uncomfortably damp.  You
feel along the walls and discover that they are covered in some sort of
slimy liquid.  Pushing against the wall produces a faint squishing noise
and your feet splash around in some unusual liquid which evolves fumes
that burn your nose and throat.  Sweat begins to bead on your forehead
and you realize for the first time how hot it is.  You guess it must be
at least 90 degrees.  As you ears adjust to the silence of this place,
you begin to make out a low thudding noise, steady and rythmic  BOOM-boom.
BOOM-boom. Suddenly, the entire room shifts, followed closely by a loud

{RED,BOLD}Warriorgirl's {WHITE}Love Shack{white,bold}~

 Here is a beautiful room, occupied by a beautiful girl. You suddenly
 realize with a shock, she has no make-up, but you think better of it,
 she needs none. There is a wicked cd player in one corner sitting
 on top of a dresser with a pile of novels. Next to the books, there
 is a whole stack of cd's that look appealing to you. There is a bed
 at one side of the room, that is not made up, probably because she
 is out beating some poor thing to death. Along another wall there is
 a window through which a beautiful countryside can be seen. Next to
 the door sits a dozen bouquets of red long stem roses, sent by all
 different people. Today's mail sits on top of a desk waiting to be
 opened. You realize that you have fallen in love with this girl already,
 and leave for the first flower shop you can find.

I Corleone here do write put my plan into solid form.  After my Hell agents
have gotten dirt on every important person on NCMUDD, we will begin to 
gradually take control from the shadows and play each muddert against 
another, like pawns in my personal chess game.  Then we I have attained 
enough power I will seize control of the MUD.  Thus completing my rise 
to power and crowning Supreme Master of all of NCMUDD!

{BO,Y}({g}{R}HELL{BO,Y}){g} {R}The Cavern of Hell Spawn{g}~

 You have reached the second level of Hell Spawn Headquarters,
 which overlooks a cold and desolate hallway.

 To your left and right you see countless reinforced hatchways.
 Rumor has it that these hatchways lead to the homes of the fiercest
 and most heartless warriors know to NC.

{BOLD}{BLACK}The Destiny Of {bold}{black}~
{BOLD}{BLACK}
   The warriors of {YELLOW}({bold}{RED}HELL{BOLD}{YELLOW}){BLACK} shall sweep across the land bringing with
   them death, chaos and a fear never before known to NCMUD. 

   Like a raging tempest they shall lay waste to their enemies and the
   battle cries of their victorious forces shall  echo across the land.  
   
   No one will be  able to stop this demonic horde from seizing
   power and ruling Northern CrossRoads with an  iron hand.  

   So let it be written that Hell shall one day conquer all of this,  the
   reality of NorthernCrossRoads and then all the  realities beyond!

   You have come to the end of the corridor. There is a sealed door to
   the north. 

   An eerie feeling comes over you when you think of where you are
   ...surrounded by thousands of miles of rock on all sides. You know
   that you are approaching the center of the earth.

   You fall a short way and end up in a deep dark crevice. There is no
   way out unless you are skilled in magic. It seems not all the traps
   here have fallen unto disrepair.

You enter a secluded room filled with sugar and spice. This sugar
is sweeter than honey, but the spice is hotter than the fire that
burns in HELL. The spa is here for all members of the Army of HELL
Spawn to prep for battle and improved their fighting skills.

In the corner of the room are two barrels one filled with sugar and
the other with spice. Sugar and Spice guard the two barrels only
allowing the members of Hell Spawn to dust themselves with the powders.
So dust up your armor and sweeten your blade and get out there
and FIGHT!
