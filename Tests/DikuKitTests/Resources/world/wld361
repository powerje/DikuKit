  Sixteen Tons
  
  Some people say a man is made out of mud.  A poor man's made of
  muscle and blood.  Muscle and blood and skin and bone.  A mind
  that's weak and back that's strong.  You load sixteen tons and 
  whatdya get? Another day older and deeper in debt.  St. Peter 
  don't ya call me cause I can't go.  I owe my soul to the company
  store . . .

  Cool Clear Water
  
  All day I face the barren waste without the taste of water, 
  Cool water.
  Old Dan and I with throats burned dry and souls that cry for water, 
  cool-clear water.
  The nights are cool and I'm a fool each stars a pool of water, 
  cool water.
  And with the dawn I wake and yawn and carry on to water, 
  cool-clear water.

  Run Around Sue
  
  Here's my story.  It's sad but true.  
  It's about a girl that I once knew. 
  She took my love then ran around with every single guy in town.
  I shoulda known it from the very start.  
  This girl would leave me with broken heart.
  Listen people what I'm telling you.

  Chances Are
  
  Chances are cause I wear a silly grin the momeny you come into

  Just because my composure sort of slips the moment that your lips
  meet mine.  Chances are you think my heart's your valentine.

  Listen to the rythm of the falling rain,
  Telling me just what a fool I've been.
  I wish that it would go and let me cry in pain.
  And let me be alone again.
  The only girl I care about has gone away, 
  Looking for a brand new start.
  But little does she know that when she left that day
  along with her she took with her my heart.
  Rain please tell me now does that seem fair,
  For her to steal my heart away when she don't care.
  I can't love another when my heart's somewhere far away. {bo,blue}

  {BO,BLUE}Proud Mary
  
  Left a good job in the city,
  Working for the man every night and day.
  And I never lost a minute of sleeping, 
  Wondering bout the way things might have been.
  Big wheels keep on turning.
  Proud Mary keep in burning.
  Rolling, Rolling, Rolling on the river.

  {BO,BLUE}Harper Valley PTA
  
  I'm wanna tell you all a story about a
  Harper Valley widowed wife.
  Who had a teenage daughter who attended
  Harper Valley Jr High.
  Well, her daughter came home one afternoon
  and didn't even stop and play.
  She said, Mom I got a note here from the Harper Valley PTA.
  Well the note said Ms Johnson
  You're wearing your dresses way to high
  It's reported you been drinking and running
  Around with men and going wild
  And we dont believe you aught to be bringing
  Up your little girl this way.
  And it was signed by the secretary Harper Valley PTA

   the anatomy of humans.  There is a counter that has sharp
