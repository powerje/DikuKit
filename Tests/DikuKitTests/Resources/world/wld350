   {C}The tapestry of the  cathedral is very old
   fashioned and the candles burn brightly in
   contrast with the darkness.   A small door
   is to the east of you, and you hear voices
   coming from the other side.   To the north
   you think  you can  see the captive queen,
   however there is  something about her that
   seems not quite human.  Perhaps you should
   take a closer look.{bo}

   with a deck of cards and  some playing chips.
   It would seem that these monsters do a lot of

   is most likely one of the humans held captive
   on the opposite end of the hall.{bo}

   make your resting place in the tainted
   Cathedral. The lights are beginning to
