{C,BO}Tutorial - Rooms{b}~

{wh}  The game of Northern Crossroads is made up of a series of rooms.
{wh}  In fact, you're standing in one of those rooms right now! These
{wh}  rooms can be absolutely anything. Here in the Northern Crossroads
{wh}  we vary from swamplands, marshes, deserts, forests, cities, plains,
{wh}  and any other landscape your mind can possibly comprehend.

{wh}  In order to navigate through these rooms, you'll need to learn the
{wh}  basic directional commands. These are: {Y,BO}north, east, south, {b}and {Y,BO}west.{b}
{wh}  These commands can also be shortened to {Y,BO}n, e, s, {b}and {Y,BO}w.{b}

{wh}  If you ever get lost and forget what you're doing in a specific room,
{wh}  the {Y,BO}"Look"{b} command is always available by either typing {Y,BO}"look" or "l".{b}

{wh}  In order to continue this tutorial, please proceed north by typing
{Y,BO}  north or n.{b}

{C,BO}Tutorial - Moving Around The Game{b}~

{wh}  The most used commands in Northern Crossroads are the various
{wh}  movement commands. We've already discussed north, east, south,
{wh}  and west, but when you are forced to climb up stairs or jump
{wh}  into a hole, it is necessary to move either {Y,BO}Up or Down{b}.

{wh}  In order to move upwards, simply type {Y,BO}Up (Or u for short).{b}
{wh}  And in order to move downwards, type {Y,BO}Down (Or d for short).{b}
{wh}  Rooms have been added to the west, east, up, and down, and are
{wh}  ready for you to explore! When you feel you have mastered the art
{wh}  of movement, feel free to move northward and continue the tutorial.{b}

{C,BO}Tutorial - Help{b}~

{wh}  If another player is unable to assist you by answering questions
{wh}  over the ADVICE or GOSSIP channel, it's always a good idea to
{wh}  browse through our help files. One will probably hold the answer
{wh}  to your questions.

{wh}  In order to view a help file, you will need to type "help" and
{wh}  then have it followed by what you're searching for. For example,
{wh}  if you were curious on how to communicate with other players,
{wh}  the most popular topic would be "Help Say". If you get a chance,
{wh}  typing help by itself offers some very basic files that may be
{wh}  worth your time reading whether it be now, or farther along into
{wh}  the game!

{wh}  When you have finished, continue north into the next tutorial
{wh}  room.{b}

{C,BO}Tutorial - Communication{b}~

{wh}  Somewhere along your journey, you'll come across opportunities
{wh}  to communicate with other members of this community. In order
{wh}  to do that, three basic commands have been left for you to
{wh}  utilize. Those are: {C,BO}Say, Tell, {b}and {C,BO}Gossip.{b}

{wh}  In order to use any of these commands, you must type the method
{wh}  (say, gossip, tell) followed by what you would like to send.

{wh}  Says are only broadcast to the room you're currently standing
{wh}  within. While gossips span across the entire world for all to
{wh}  hear, and finally, tells are for private messages you need to
{wh}  send directly to a specific player.{b}

{C,BO}Tutorial - Channels{b}~

{wh}  Throughout the came, you'll encounter various things you'd like
{wh}  to say. Gossip is currently the most used channel and welcomes
{wh}  any sort of conversation as long as the topic is not profane.
{wh}  However, if you are searching for a place where you can vent
{wh}  freely, the flame channel is where you should head. There are
{wh}  many other channels, including ones for sports, music, and
{wh}  roleplayers. To see a full list, type "channels". To turn a
{wh}  specific channel on for you to hear, type "channel" followed
{wh}  by the name of the channel. For example: "channel flame".{b}

{C,BO}Tutorial - Equipment{b}~

{wh}  A major part of this game is finding equipment for you to use.
{wh}  This can be accomplished through a variety of methods. The most
{wh}  basic of which, is killing NPCs. There are hundreds of areas,
{wh}  well over 30,000 rooms, and a ton of NPCs out for you to hunt.

{wh}  To wear a piece of equipment you receive, use the "wear" command.
{wh}  To remove a piece of equipment, use the "remove" command.
{wh}  To wield a weapon you find, use the "wield" command.
{wh}  To unwield a weapon you find, use the "unwield" command.
{wh}  To attempt to wear everything, use the "wear all" command.

{C,BO}Tutorial - Health, Mana, and Movement{b}~

{wh}  Health, Mana, and Movement are three of the most vital things
{wh}  to understand in Northern Crossroads.

{wh}  Health is the amount of health that your player currently has.
{wh}  If your health happens to drop all the way to zero, you will die
{wh}  and your corpse (along with your equipment) will be left on the
{wh}  ground in the room where you met your death.

{wh}  Mana is the amount of magic you're able to use. Every spell
{wh}  costs a set amount of mana, and once your pool of mana has
{wh}  drained low enough, you'll need to wait a few minutes for it
{wh}  to recharge.

{wh}  Finally, movement dictates how far you can move, as well as how
{wh}  long you can fight. With every attack, you're movement will slowly
{wh}  drop, and once it is gone, you'll need to find food, drink, or
{wh}  a place to rest until it regenerates.

{C,BO}Tutorial - Skills{b}~

{wh}  In order to conquer your opponent, you will need to know various
{wh}  skills to help out in your combat. Each class holds a different
{wh}  skill set, but all are very useful in their own way. You'll need
{wh}  to train these skills as you explore at your guildmaster. Depending
{wh}  on which class you have chosen, the directions to your guildmaster
{wh}  will be posted in the "DIR list" which can be accessed by typing
{wh}  "dir".

{CY,BO}Tutorial - Spells{b}~

{wh}  Some classes have a series of helpful spells. For example, a
{wh}  mage can cast a 'solar flare', or a cleric can cast 'heal',
{wh}  while a sorcerer can 'teleport'. All these are helpful and
{wh}  unique, but every caster needs to know their basics in order
{wh}  to develop a mastery in their art.

{wh}  To begin, to cast a spell, you must be sure you've trained it
{wh}  at your trainer, otherwise the spell will be ineffective, and
{wh}  might even backfire when you attempt to cast. Secondly, any
{wh}  wizard should know how to utter the words of power. You can do
{wh}  this by typing "{C,BO}cast '<spell>'{b}".

{wh}  Soon you'll be on your way to becoming one of the best, so
{wh}  take some time to go over the knowledge you've learned thus
{wh}  far before moving on.{b}

{C,BO}Tutorial - Combat{b}~

{wh}  To begin combat with an NPC, the most basic command at your disposal
{wh}  is the "kill" command. If you type "kill mob" it will automatically
{wh}  attack the first NPC in the room, and all you have to do is kick back
{wh}  and watch your character do all the work.

{wh}  Mind you, combat won't always be as easy as this. Most areas around
{wh}  Northern Crossroads will prove to be much more difficult.

{wh}  have completed your training. In order to move onto the next
{wh}  area, you will need to enter the portal here. To do this, type
{wh}  "enter portal".  Us here at the Northern Crossroads look forward
{wh}  to your arrival.

     The ominous roar of thunder seems to be getting louder and 
     louder the more you wander around in this God-forsaken maze.
     Off in the distance you can see the very tiptop of something. 
     You can't tell what, but it seems to be where the storm is a 
     brewing.

     Here large boulders are strewn about carelessly as if a child
     had spilled a bag of marbles. There seems to be no distinct 
     pattern to their layout. Although it's not completely 
     unattractive, somehow it gives you an eerie feeling.

     As you stumble past the rocks, a very large patch of 
     lilies, not any normal lilies but {BLA,BO}death lilies{bla,bo}, greets you. 
     The air reeks of decay. Along with the strange storm brewing 
     almost overhead, this place is starting to give you the willies.

     The storm overhead seems to be getting worse with every    
     step you take. Off in the distance you can make out the 
     distinct outline of a large building. The building itself seems 
     to be swirling in vortex of darkness!

     a grim reminder of their trade: bones and bloodstains are 
     everywhere. Standing in the center of this room is the 
     caretaker of this dreaded room.

{BO,BLACK}A Dark Hallway{bo,black}~

     This hallway seems to be leading away form the laboratory, 
     wonder where it goes? Off in the distance you can here the 
     sounds of animals. Could they have done experiments on animals 
     too?

{BO,YELLOW}Animal Cages{bo,yellow}~

     Animal cages seem to take up the bigger part of this room. 
     Some of them have been busted open and its inhabitant has 
     long since escaped. By look at some of the other unfortunate 
     creatures, you hope you don't meet any.

{WHITE}Bookcases{white}~

     This bookcase is unlike those ones in the library. These are 
     not quite so filled and they mostly pertain to alchemy not 
     general knowledge.

{BO,RED}Experiment{bo,red} Tables~

     This scene reminds you of one form the movie Frankenstein. A 
     large table with all kinds of hoses and wires leading to it 
     dominates the center of the room, beside it are all kinds of 
     odd-looking machines.

{BO,BLACK}The Dark Corner{bo,black}~

     This dark little corner hasn't seen anyone walking it in a 
     long, long time. Cobwebs hanging down low from the ceiling and 
     dust covers the floor. Off in the distance you hear and animal 
     cry in, agony or hunger, either one doesn't suit you too well.

{BO,GREEN}Guard Post??{bo,green}~

     From the looks of this place you would swear it was a guard 
     post. But what does a temple need a guard post on the top level 
     of it?

     This musty hallway seems to be like every other hallway in 
     this place. The same old glows coming form the walls, same dank 
     smell to it. Just another old hallway.

     You must be getting somewhere because this floor is lavishly

Stairwell~

     This stairwell is far from the same as any other stairway in 
     the place. You can hear a faint hum and the crackle of 
     electricity coming form the top. An evil red glow seems to 
     be coming from the top.

{BO,RED}RUTUAL ROOM{bo,red}~

     Upon entering this room you magical silence is over. 
     Standing in front of you is a group of priest in the middle of 
     some ritual, none of them seem too happy with the intrusion. 
     But they're giving you a change to explain yourself.

     Once you make it to the top, you are greeted by to most

     The feeling up such pure power that's in this room fills as 
     if it's going to rip you in two. The sound of chanting, a 
     magical hum, and lightning striking is all you hear in this
     raging chaos.

     Like the room before you feel like your going to pulled 
     apart. But also you can feel chaos in its purest form here. 
     standing in the middle of this room stands a lone figure, The 
     {BO,RED}High{bo,red} {BO,BLUE}Priest{bo,blue} of {BO,BLACK}O{bo,black}{BLUE}r{blue}{BO,BLACK}c{bo,black}{BLUE}u{blue}{BO,BLACK}s{bo,black}. He seems to be in the middle of casting
