The Hallway~
Now you have made your way back to the main hallway of this
palace, and you wonder what else is gonna happen while you
are here. Down the hallway you still see the throne room
of the Negaverse's Queen Beryl.

As you continue down this hallway you start to notice the
floor rising a few feet ahead, and the ceiling is also 
coming down.. If you want to get past this part, you better
hurry.

of you. There might be a way around it.... You look around for a 
solution, and notice a hallway to your east.

Now that you passed another one of Queen Beryl's traps, you wonder
what's next. Surely at this moment in time one can be prepared for 
anything. Looking ahead, you can't wait until you sever Queen Beryl's
head with your weapon.

Now you have found a doorway. As you go to enter it a creepy hand
grabs you. It looks like it doesn't want to let you pass into
this room. What's so important about the room? It could have

Now that you've beaten that guard you walk into this room. In

because he did not please Queen Beryl. You can't help but wonder
about how his eyes can move and look at you while in suspended

Queen Beryl and this thing have discussions about how to get more
energy for the Negaverse. Maybe if you beat this thing, her plans

Crystal I took from Princess Serena of the Moon, the one also known
as Sailor Moon, and have captured her mother, Queen Serenity, I can
release the NegaForce and take over the Earth! And you fools cannot

You float downwards and land on a small ledge, the crevice seems
to keep going downward into the earth. There doesn't seem to be
anyway to go back up the hole, since the sides are much to smooth
to grab a hold of anything for the climb back up.

Down the hole~
You float downwards and land on a small ledge, the crevice seems
to keep going downward into the earth. There doesn't seem to be
anyway to go back up the hole, since the sides are much to smooth
to grab a hold of anything for the climb back up. You seem to see
some sort of floor right below you.

On the Ground.~
You have finally hit the floor after traveling down this hole.
In the distance you see a giant tree, and a few people running
around as well. This pathway continues to the north, but you
have a strange sense that getting around is gonna be a bit tricky.

Before the Doom Tree~
You stand before one of the largest trees you have seen before
in your entire life. At one time this tree must have been very
beautiful, but as you look at it now, you see that is seems
to have withered enough to the point of dying. There seems to
be a bit of activity at the top of the tree, and you can feel
the evil radiating from that point.

You have defeated that young girl that blocked your path, and now you got
to contend with her boyfriend. He looks up at you, puts down his flute
that he is playing, and stands up. In his hand you see a glowing spectre.
He starts saying about how he took Sailor Moon's weapon and now nothing
is going to stop him from taking energy and restoring the dune tree.
Looks like you better stop him fast.

Hey! You didn't notice anything underneath Queen Beryl's throne, You
crawl into the hole under the throne, and you notice a large pit in
the middle of this room. As you approach the pit, you notice two
of Queen Beryl's stinking guards crawling out of it. You wonder
what they were doing in the pit, but looks like they don't want
you to know.

You fall into a pit that is about 10 feet deep. It looks like
you can crawl out of the pit, because the walls don't look too
steep. As you start to go back you, you see a woman shackled in
chains in the corner. It looks like she tried to fight off those
two guards you just defeated, but didn't succeed. She still looks
like she can put up a fight, still. You also notice that she looks
kind of like that cartoon character, Sailor Moon, complete with the
hairstyle. Looks like she doesn't have much taste.

{BOLD}{CYAN}Peaceful Crystal Entrance{cyan}{bold}~
{BOLD}{CYAN}
So this is the room where the Wise Man teleported you to..
so far it appears so peaceful.. so serene.

When you gather yourself together you start to realize that
you're floating high above the world as you look down. The
clear crystal floor shows a beautiful portrait of the landscape
below.
You sigh to yourself as you realize that you've never had peace
like this before... then suddenly..

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!
An evil laugh breaks the silence. You now realize just why you are
here, to save Sailor Moon from the clutches of the evil Wise Man..
Imagine the reward if you can defeat the Wise Man.. IF you can.
Another evil laugh echoing throughout the crystal chamber indicates
that the Wise Man is not alone... Good luck.

Now you stand in the center of this giant crystal room. While you
stand in the center of this room, you look in amazement at how
vast this room seems. As you look down, you see crystal clear enough
to see through. When you gaze downward you look in awe at the city
below you. Yes.. you are floating in mid air, inside of a rather
small, but dubious crystal palace. You really get the sense of an
evil air inside of this palace, and you don't want to be around here
for very long. Maybe the safety of the town below will help
comfort you.. but you have to remember, there's someone to be saved!
Being the heroes that you are... you know you have to press forward
and do your duty!

You are standing in a rather large room. The floor and the walls
surrounding you are made of a light blue crystal, which seems to
give off some magical energy as you step throughout this room.
You hear heavy breating, but it seems echoed... as if there was
another presence in this room with you!

As you hear the heavy breathing, and try to locate its source,
you notice another type of breathing coming from your north,
as you glance at the crystal wall, you think you see a keyhole
somewhere, but are not quite sure.

Now that you and your companions have offed Rubeus, it's time to
see who was behind the latest abduction of our hero, Sailor Moon.
As you look behind you out into the large crystal room where you
were last, you get the notion that something powerful lies ahead.
Right before you, you notice a very large crystal door, locked
by the very key you grabbed off of Rubeus's corpse. As you near
the door to open it, a strange sensation overcomes your body.
It seems like some sort of power coming from behind the door is
creeping into your soul.

The Wise Man's chambers~
{BOLD}{YELLOW}
Uh oh... there's no way out of this room now. The crystal walls
slowly rumble and close up behind you, trapping you in this room
with nowhere to go. You are now all alone in this room.. for the
moment. As you gaze slowly around the room, you sense a great power
forming behind you. As you draw your weapon and turn around, you
see a powerful wizard take shape right behind you. This wizard, called
the Wise Man, runs his hands over a dark orb that crackles with
intense power. As he stares coldly at you, you can sense the evil
in his soul slowly creep up and down your spine. Suddenly, you
freeze in fright for a moment, before you calm yourself. Once
you calm yourself, you realize that the only ways out of this
predicament are to kill this guy, or to use your magical powers to
escape.
