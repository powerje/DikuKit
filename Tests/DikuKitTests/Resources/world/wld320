{BOLD,WHITE}Before the Ruins of Valorn{b}~
{C}
   These once great gates stood here to protect from invaders and the 
   beasts of the night, now they are dilapidated and entwined with 
   vines, hardly protection from the outside world now. You wonder 
   what things are hidden behind these gates; and whether it be 
   treasure or guardians of the damned. Just beyond the gates you can 
   see the entryway to the castle. A sign is on the gates, barely 
   visible.

{BOLD,WHITE}Entryway to the Castle{b}~
{C}
   A large wooden door, barely scarred by the passing of time, blocks 
   your entrance into the castle. The stones around the door have 
   started to crumble and vines have covered them. The entryway is 
   guarded by two fierce looking stone gargoyles that are worn with 
   age. They seem so life like, that look as if they are breathing....

   This was once the grand hallway of the castle. Its' peak looks to be
   nearly twenty feet. The once great tapestries that covered the 
   walls are now decayed and crumbling from age. High above, light 
   enters through large stained glass windows. The windows seem to depict
   the great battles the castle has seen.
