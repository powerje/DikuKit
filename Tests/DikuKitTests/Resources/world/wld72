Colorful Shroom Field~
     Whoooaaa, the colors... the colors...!  You stagger around in this
field with colorful shrooms scattered all over the place.  Colors are
exploding all around you and you can see fish flying overhead and
the rocks are singing a weird lullaby.  You are totally lost, but
you're so high you couldn't care less....

The Organic Passage~
     Ah at last!  You've finally something beyond that blasted field!
Colorful spots still swim around in front of your eyes and you're
still hallucinating that talking spiders are crawling around, but at least
you can make out this odd passage.... the walls seem to be oddly
pulsating... then you realize that this isn't a natural tunnel, you're
somehow inside an organic tunnel inside some huge living
beast...

     As you proceed further into the organic tunnel, you can hear soft
beating sounds ahead.  You wonder what it could be....  also, this
tunnel seem to be pulsating to the beat, and the floor shifts
sickenly under you...

     Man, the beating sound sure is loud in here!  You cover your tender ears
and look around and you finally see the source of that sound.. its'a pulsating
heart beating in the center of this blood-red chamber.  Veins line all over
the "walls" in here.  You wonder what kind of a beast you possibly be inside
but anything this big sure can't be good for anyone.. mebbe you'd better
kill the heart and kill this beast.  You also see the exit back to the shroom
field to the north, and already your head is starting to swim again...

The Smelly and Slimy Fungus Passage~
     Oh man!  You've finally gotten out of that damned shroom field
and entered a smelly fungii-covered passage.  As the stink assaults
your nose, you're not sure if you'd rather be in here after all...  and
the colors weren't THAT bad...

this smelly tunnel.  At least it's not very dark as the fungii glows with
an eerie blue light.  You can also feel a strange sort of a.... presence
somewhere up ahead....

In a Vast Fungus Chamber~
     Finally that hideous smelly slide ends and you plop ungracefully
into a pile of moldy fungii!  Standing up and wiping the wet slime
off your clothes as well as you can, you stare around in this huge
cave.  You can see some pulpy mass in the center of this room.
It's only a pile of gigantic mushrooms and fungii, but yet you can sense
an odd sort of a sentinence from it...

The Entrance to the Realm of silence~
This is an utterly silent place. As you look around you see that there
hasn't been a living thing in a long time. The dust lies here in a thick
layer on the floor and on the furniture. On the wall hangs a bleak and 
worn tapestry. A winding stone staircase leads up into darkness. On the 
wall to the west you can see a huge torch stuck into the solid rock.
A large portcullis blocks your way to the north.
