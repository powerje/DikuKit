{B,WH}  The{b,wh} {GR}Timber {B,WH}station for trains going to the Desert
{B,WH}  is very small.  There is a shop to the west, and
{B,WH}  a bar to the north.  A gate that leads to the

{B,WH}  in front of it that says {RE}KEEP OUT{WH}.  Stairs lead

{Y}The Pub{y}~

  The pub by the Desert Station is a very high-tech
  looking place.  The west part of the large room
  is dominated by a semi-circular bar raised up on
  a platform.  A balustrade encircles the bar,
  leaving enough room for patrons to sit at the bar
  and for others to walk behind them.  Those who
  do not wish to sit at the bar can find seats at
  the tables in the other half of the room.  Large
  video screens and spot lighting enhance the
  futuristic feel of the place.

{B,BO}Alley Behind the Pub{b,bo}~
{B,BO}
  Broken wooden crates and moldy cardboard boxes
  fill this narrow, dark alley behind the pub.
  Trash carelessly dumped on the ground makes the
  tiles slimy.  A high wall to the east and the
  backs of buildings to the west block most of the
  sunlight.  The alley continues to the north, and
  ends at a backdoor to the south.

  Empty steel drums and broken wooden crates fill

  beyond a graffiti-covered wall to the east.  The
  buildings to the west have no backdoors that
  open out on to this alley.  There is, however, a
  staircase that winds up a tall, strange-looking
  building to the north.

{B,WH}  building.  Halfway up the stairs, there is a huge
{B,WH}  outdoor screen that makes a loud humming noise.
{B,WH}  Red text scrolls down the screen so fast that the

{BOLD,BLACK}  This is a set in the TV station.  Three cameras
{BOLD,BLACK}  and sound equipment are pointed toward the stage,
{BOLD,BLACK}  which contains a podium and a bank of microphones
{BOLD,BLACK}  flanked by two Galbadian flags.  The backdrop is
{BOLD,BLACK}  a red velvet curtain with a seal of the Galbadian
{BOLD,BLACK}  president.  There is a small room to the west, or
