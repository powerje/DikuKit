        STuDD sits at a dimly lit table in the far 
        back with a gorgeous woman on each lap. He 
        lights up a blunt and  gestures for you to 
        join  his  table. Your heart leaps  at the 
        prospect  of sitting  with the Don ... but 
        then you  realize he was  gesturing to the 
        pretty girl behind you.

     {BLACK,BOLD}This room is dimly lit with a single {black,bold}{RED}RED{red} {BLACK,BOLD}light bulb in

     implements of torture carelessly strewn about. Everything
     from razors and rubbing alcohol, to car batteries and jumper

     this room.{black,bold}

{CY,BO}The Malkavian Questioning Room{cy}~


     {BLUE,BOLD}The implements that lay around this room would cause instant
     chills to run up the spine of the bravest person.  This must
     certainly be  the infamous "back room" that  is rumoured  to
     exist. Being questioned about anything while simply being in
     this room would be enough to force a confession from anyone.{blue,bold}

     {BLACK,BOLD}Dental tools  that look like  they came from a museum, rusty
     tools, oversized nails, candles with feces still stinking on
     the bottom of them, and other implements that are not easily
     identifiable are  scattered across the  tables that line the
     walls of this nightmare.{black,bold}

     simmering pasta, releasing the sweet aroma of basil,
     garlic, meat, and cheese. {black}

          {RED}A darkness is rising
          Souls are corrupting
          Chaos seeking,
          assailants in a shadowy disguise.

          All that is good shall fall
          The blanket of night will cover all
          The voice of the silent shadows will call
          all that try to hide.

          The cold will make you shiver to the core
          All will fall to the shadow's allure
          And all who oppose will cower before
          the shadow with crimson eyes.{red}

     {RED,BOLD}The first thing you notice as you enter the room is a 
     shrunken head and various body parts in several glass

     the room you see {red,bold}{WHITE,BOLD}Dragonblood{white,bold}{RED,BOLD} in the middle of a pentacle 
     made of blood, chanting some unholy ritual. In a flash of 
     light he is gone and the dwarf {red,bold}{WHITE,BOLD}Myllonir{white,bold}{RED,BOLD} stands in his place 
     ready for battle.{red,bold}

    {BOLD,YELLOW}There {BOLD,WHITE}is nothing but a large, cold slab of granite in
    the middle of the room. All the walls are made of 
    stone and there are no windows of any sort. As you
    approach the granite slab, you begin to make out the 
    silhouette of {BOLD,RED}Cadaver {BOLD,WHITE}the mortician, who seems to be
    busy sharpening his cleaver. Maybe you should come back

     {GREEN}You've just entered and find yourself standing on an
     elongated platform that runs the length of the room.
     The walls to your right  and left curve up and over 
     your head and down and under the platform. Above your
     head is a light so bright it seems like an indoor sun.
     A gentle breeze flows through the room.  You notice a
     pungent aroma, and then notice that the walls are slowly 
     revolving.  Closer inspection  shows the walls  to be
     covered with growing plants that slowly ascend way over
     your head, curve over and descend to.  As you look down 
     it seems that  the plants are slowly moving  through a 
     couple of inches of water.  This whole room is a unique
     greenhouse, a really neat setup.

     You wonder about the kinds of plants someone would grow
     in a room like this?{green}

     {MAGENTA,BOLD}The sexy sounds of Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On" plays 
     serenely in the background.  A nude poster of {magenta,bold}{MAGENTA}Cashew{magenta}{MAGENTA,BOLD} looking 
     at you provocatively makes you tingle inside.  Many lava lamps 
     illuminate the room seductively, and gets you in the mood.
     You sit on the coin-operated vibrating bed and take a deep 
     breath of incense sticks that burn softly in virtually every 
     corner of the room.  Your attention is momentarily diverted to
     a bookshelf with dozens of gold trophies on it.  Upon closer 
     inspection, you realize they are commemorations for his love
     making abilities.  You are suddenly struck by pangs of envy as 
     you notice the autographed photograph of {magenta,bold}{MAGENTA}STuDD{magenta}{MAGENTA,BOLD}, the legendary 
     winner of the 1998 Best Hair Contest.{magenta,bold}
