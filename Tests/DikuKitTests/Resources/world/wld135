{G}A Grassy Trail{g}~

  {G}You leave the main road and see a grassy path leading into
  a wood.  There is a {BO}sign{bo,G} here with writing in the common 
  tongue, with an arrow pointing toward the wood.  All around you
  is the stark beauty of nature, and you feel at peace.

{G}A Grassy Trail Ends{g}~

  {G}The manicured trail ends abruptly as it passes narrowly between
  two great elm trees.  A path cuts through the wood and turns 
  to the left, out of your sight beyond the treeline.

{G,BO}The Silent Wood{bo,g}~

  {BO,G}The trail quickly disappears from your sight, and you find yourself 
  surrounded by ancient trees with huge limbs and thick branches.
  You try to peer back out to the trail, but it is now out of sight.
  There is complete silence - no whispering of the wind, no birds
  chirping, not a sound from the underbrush.{bo,g}

{G,BO}The Silent Wood{bo,g}~

  {G,BO}You walk along the wood line but you cannot see out of the forest
  due to the profusion of thick, twisted branches.  The sky is almost
  completely hidden by the canopy of leaves over head.  You look south and
  see a whitewashed stone building in the distance.  The silence
  begins to unnerve you.

  reinforced door facing you and no indication of its purpose.  You do 
  notice that the white compound used to paint the stones of the building
  seems to be somewhat new, and that there are footprints in the patch
  of grass leading up to the grim door.{bo,g}

  {BO,W}The entryway into this strange building fills you with a sense of 
  wonder and foreboding.  As the door closes behind you, you realize that you
  are alone.  From somewhere you cannot determine, the sweet scent of
  incense wafts through the room.  The walls are covered in strange sigils
  in a language you cannot understand.  The sigils seem to shine like silver,
  which gives the room an eerie, cold light.  Your eyes fall to a stone
  door with no lock or knob, and you start to question whether or not
  you belong here.

with a thick black fog rising from its massive mouth. The walls are seem to
shift and change as you look at them. From one scene to another the walls
change, showing the history of our great world.

The Altar of the Dark Queen~
   The haze of the evil that composses the hallway slowly coalesces into
a more solid, familiar type of terrain. Unfortunately, the relief of solid
does not last long, for you find yourself in the most horrific of places
imaginable. An altar, made of bone and gold, and serpent skin, lies blood
stained in the center of the room. Standing in back of it is a portal,
the likes of which you have never seen. Five dragon heads, form a circle
around a mirror. Each head a different color, black, white, blue, green,
red, and each caught in an act of what looks to be a scream of exquisite
agony. Looking through the mirror, you see a land that twists and convulses,
ever-changing, chaotic. You look upon the Abyss, the home of the dark
queen herself. You have entered the home of the Dark Queen herself. You
have reached the Altar of Takhisis, Goddess of Evil.

to the dark god Soth. She must live out her life as a hobbit, never inter-
reacting with another life. She stands before you, floating in midair. A 
large black cloud fills the room, and sends an odd sensation through your
body. Two large heads, one dragons the other human, have beed mounted on the
far northern wall. A large hole in the ceiling casts a golden light down
