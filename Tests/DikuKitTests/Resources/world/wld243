     Whoa!! You almost slipped and fell!  You just stepped
in what must be the largest pile of poop you have ever seen.
There are piles everywhere.  Certainly would be messy if
you fell.  You better be really careful.

The Hallway~

     The hallway seems to go on forever.  On each wall of
this hallway, there are banks of lockers as far as the eye
can see.  Every row of 50 lockers seems to end at a door.
Time to watch those teachers in action!  I wonder if they
realize that they are the ones being graded today!

The English Class~

     Uhhhgggg! The walls are covered with sappy and some crappy
poems.  You look at them and begin to feel ill. You never were
one to get into that sappy stuff.  There is a sentence written
on the blackboard.  Apparently the teacher is trying to explain
something to his attentive students.  This guy's sensitivity is
really starting to make you sick.  Time to kill him.. Go FOR IT!

smell is or the origin, but its really starting to make you
feel a little sick to the stomach.
     You take a big whiff, and realize it is coming up from
the stairs that lead down.  Time to investigate!

A mountain cabin~
You find yourself in a cozy room.  Looking up you see a vaulted ceiling
supported by heavy looking oak beams.  The north wall is composed completely
of stone with a huge fireplace built into the wall.  There is a fire
burning which illuminates the room with a mellow light.  The west wall is a
marine aquarium.  It looks like a huge reef with colorful fish swimming
about.  It almost looks as though this may be the entrance to an undersea
dimension.  The south wall has a large window.  The view through the window
is overlooking a mountain range.  Evergreens weighted with snow are
scattered on the mountain slope below.  It is snowing outside except the
snow never seems to accumulate.  Large flakes resembling feathers fall to
the ground.  To the east is a heavy oak door trimmed in brass.

     The hallway here seems a little strange.  It seems
to continue on towards the north.  Too bad there is a heavy
gate preventing you from going there.  You wouldn't want
to go that way anyway..  The hallway is completely dark.
You stop and listen for a moment and realize that not a 
sound is comming from that direction except a steady drip
of liquid.  SPOOKY!  
     There are double doors to the west of here.  Maybe
you should find out what is behind them.

The Hall of Knowledge~

     The energy emitting from this room is almost unbearable.
So many memories of the past begin to rush through your head.
It makes it so hard to think!  All you can do is try to fight
to maintain your sanity.  Memories of the past are flashing so
fast and at the same time, sensations of other events that may
be the future, invade your mind at the same time causing
intense pain within your pitiful skull.
     You focus your thoughts enough to realize that there is a
BRIGHT LIGHT in the center of the room.  You also sense a
presence of great overwhelming strength.

inscription on them.  You feel the energy rush through your
body and if you look closer at the doors you think you may
somehow understand these symbols.

You squint at the symbols and suddenly the
hidden meaning invades your brain:

     MORTALS WHO DARE TRESPASS SHALL BE UNDER
     JUDGEMENT OF THE GODS.  ARE YOU WORTHY??

     DARE NOT ENTER UNLESS YOU ARE WILLING TO
     MAKE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE!

As quickly as the words became readable they
are gone.....

Base of the TEMPLE~

     You look above you in total awe.  This temple glows
a brilliant white.  This is definately the source of the
humming sensation.
     There are a set of stairs that lead to what must be
the doors to this catherdral.  You step on to the first step, and
instantly you entire body becomes aware of the electric
pulses emitting from this building.

A quiet meadow~

     Your eyes re-focus to reveal a beautiful meadow. This
is a strange magical land so far away from the pressure of
adventuring. You see a beautiful pond that looks brilliant
with the light from the sun reflecting off its surface. The
sun's heat warms your heart as well and helps to lift your
spirits.  You soon forget all worries.
     To the north, up a large hill, is the most magnificent
temple. It almost appears to glow. You detect a strange hum
coming from that direction. You can't really hear it, only
feel its ominous pulse.

BRIGHT LIGHT~

     Ahhhh! This room is much easier on your brain then the last
room!  You find yourself enjoying quiet time and wonder how long 
it will last.
     You look around and find a small fountain in the corner.  It's
quiet bubbling sound almost puts you into a trance.
