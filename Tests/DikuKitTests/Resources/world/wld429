{bold}{GREEN}  You have discovered the start of the Muerte o Copula Trail. This
  enchanted path is guarded by spirits that challenge male hopefuls to
  only allow the strongest and bravest to pass and mate with the females
  of Tiwanaku. The path continues north{BOLD}{BLACK} with a steep climb. You can
  barely see the shore and the lake through the small vegetated
  entrance. It is not too late to turn back.{bold}

   Here, at the top of the 4th step of the Akapana Pyramid, you have a
   breathtaking view of Tiwanaku. The 5th step is a large empty chamber
   with plaster covered walls which have painted carvings depicting the
   four powerful founding matriarchs who helped establish the Tiwanaku
   culture. In the center of the chamber is a golden statue of the 
   Goddess Diosa de la Mujer. {BOLD}{BLACK}The matriarchs relied on this Goddess for{bold}

{BOLD}{WHITE}   You now stand{bold}{RED} at the shri{BOLD}{RED}ne t{bold}{RED}o Nacim{BOLD}{WHITE}iento. The marble floor is almost{bold}
{BOLD}{WHITE}   completely cover{bold}{RED}ed in a com{BOLD}{RED}bina{bold}{RED}tion of {BOLD}{WHITE}dried and new blood. Pillars{bold}

{BOLD}{WHITE}   came, and red fabric has {bold}{RED}been draped along{BOLD}{WHITE} the pillars. The shrine{bold}
{BOLD}{WHITE}   is a stone archway which rese{bold}{RED}mbles a wa{BOLD}{WHITE}ll with a doorway. The wall{bold}
{BOLD}{WHITE}   is covered in carvings explaining that the doorway is symbolic of{bold}
{BOLD}{WHITE}   passing from the previous life into the present. Ironically, this{bold}
{BOLD}{WHITE}   place has seen a lot of death and the question now is will it see{bold}
{BOLD}{WHITE}   yours?{bold}
