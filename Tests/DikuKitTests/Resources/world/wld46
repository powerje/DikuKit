makes a squish sound when you step on it, and a sucking sound when you lift

Pterodactyl Nest~
You step into a huge open bowl made from branches that are almost as big
around as you and leaves that would completely cover you like a blanket!
This must be a Pterodactyl's nest!

Pterodactyl Nest~
You descend deeper into the nest.  Why?  Are you hoping the mother
Pterodactyl will come back and sit on you to keep you warm?  Maybe she'll
shove some meat down your throat too.

Limb~
You tread out onto a small limb.  It can easily support your weight, but it
looks like it's covered in moss.  It might be a little slippery so watch
your footing.

Swampy Rainforest~
Somehow you survived that tremendous fall! You are now standing in a pile of
muck. You are apparently in some kind of marshy rainforest. Distant roars 
make you feel very uncomfortable.

Swampy Rainforest~
You tread around in a marshy, swamplike rainforest.  It is very hot an humid.
The flora is very lush, and can support the largest of the dinosaurs.  And
where you find the largest herbivores, you are bound to find the largest
carnivores!
