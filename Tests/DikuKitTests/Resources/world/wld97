{BLA,BO}  Night has permanently befallen the area. A mystical swirling
{BLA,BO}  mist encompasses you and your allies, the light silver tendrils
{BLA,BO}  of its existence creating a thick fog which is difficult to
{BLA,BO}  view through. Crosses arise from the ground, the maimed and
{BLA,BO}  fallen limbs of previous heroes decomposed into nothing but
{BLA,BO}  bone to stick beyond the swampy marsh at your feet.{b}

{BLA,BO}  Still, the mist is almost overburdening with its thickness. Your
{BLA,BO}  feet messily slosh through the wet, cold swamp and all around
{BLA,BO}  you, the world is filled with an encumbering silence. Without the
{BLA,BO}  familiar transparency of the air, very little is distinguishable
{BLA,BO}  beyond that of a large willow tree. Its roots are weak and each
{BLA,BO}  of its limbs have been ridden of all allusions of life. Like

{BLA,BO}  Nearby stairs lead beneath an eerily old Cathedral. Its walls are
{BLA,BO}  ridden with torches, long reminiscent for the warmth of a flame.
{BLA,BO}  After years of abandonment, their wood has been long petrified and

  Hey, this place even has an elevator!  Looking at the
  wall, right beside the buttons, is a small sign that
  reads use at your own risk.  You kinda wonder if it
  would be a good idea to use it or to take the stairs.
  the choice is your's, I don't know if I would take a 
  chance or not.

  Looking across the room, it is a peaceful,

  copy room and back to the office hallway.
  People walk around the outside of the 
  office looking in at you and what you are 
  doing here.  Nice, soft chairs still around
  the wall just waiting for someone to sit in
  them.

  use the phones, and trying to make a good excuse for 
  laying out of school the day before.  You are almost 
  knocked down by the people running around, you might 
  want to get out of their way.  Chairs are lined up 
  against the wall to your west and south, go ahead and 
  have a seat, you might need to rest before you continue 
  on with your journey.

  You are standing behind the office counter.  To
  your east and to your north are two doors, one 
  is the office of the school secretary and the   
  other to the office of the school bookkeeper.  
  The sound of ringing telephones echo all around
  you, you wish they would stop really soon.  The 
  student aides push you out of their way like you
  are nothing, looks like you need to teach them a 
  little lesson about respect.

  to the north and the west are the doors to the

  up much of this office.  Sitting on top of the desk 
  are general office supplies, stacks of papers, and a 
  portrait of her beautiful family.  There is also the 
  monitor of a junky computer that flashes on and off 
  like it is possessed by some demon.  Malinda turns, 
  looks up at you and smiles.

  after you.

  copy and mail room, to your right is the paper 
  storage room, straight ahead of you is the principal's 
  office and the hall continues from there.  People walk

  strange noise comes from the office infront of you. 
  It seems to sound like someone is have some problems 
  breathing, this may be something you would want to 
  check out.

  Just by walking to this rooms, your body is filled 
  with chills.  As you look infont of you, you cannot 
  believe the site before your eyes.  A large, gray 
  haired man sitting behind the desk stands up and is 
  only wearing his glasses and a lepard print thong.  
  As the flabs of skin jiggle, you cringe in terror.  
  He beams a smile at you and asks you to step behind 
  his desk.  If you know what is good for you, you will 
  run now.

  the way you came.  Just by standing quietly, you can 
  hear the sound of laughing and talking coming from 
  the north wall.  You cannot tell what is being said
  but you can tell they are human and that they are not
  in a good mood.

  Back to the south is the way that you entered the 
  hallway.  The walls shine with what little light
  there is around you giving you spooky feeling that
  sends chills up your spine.

  This is a bend in the hallway.  Around the corner, the
  hallway continues to the north.  To the west is the 
  direction in which you came.  To south is a door that
  is probably the office to one of the faculty members
  of this school.  An eerie sound comes from behind that
  door, it kind of makes you wish that you had remembered
  to wear your diaper this morning.

  a small microwave.  A group of angry teachers
  sit around the table and talk about who they are
  going to get even with the administration about
  not getting a pay raise.  If I were you, I would
  stand clear of this group of people.

  some sort of lounge or kitchen setting.  It seems
  that the longer you stand here that the colder the

The Vocational Office Lobby~

  In the east corner of this room sits a large 
  office desk.  Behind the desk sits a very
  think lady, with very dark skin, and long dark
  brown hair.  As you walk in the door, she looks
  up at you with the weirdest smile you have ever
  seen.  The room is warm and peaceful, one of the
  most peaceful you have been in so far.  The white
  walls shine in the bright light and beautiful 
  blue carpet covers the floor.

The Vocational Office Lobby~

  Sitting all along the walls are chairs with dark
  blue cloth.  The white walls shine in the bright 
  light and beautiful blue carpet covers the floor.  
  Looking to the south, you can see people walking 
  through the shades going to their classes.  A few
  portraits of beautiful mountain settings are hanging
  on the walls.

  A few portraits of beautiful mountain settings

  bright florescent lights hanging from the ceiling.
  Students come in and out of the office and talk to 
  a woman sitting at a desk in the western corner.

An Empty Office~

  This is an empty room that once was the office of 
  a past employee.  The poor soul that was once held 
  in this office is now in a better place.  An empty 
  desk sits against the far wall.  On the wall to your 
  left are boxing with the person's belongings packed 
  in them waiting to be picked up by the family.  An 
  eerie cry whails through the room and a slight breeze 
  blows.
