You now look upon a desolate landscape, there is an 
orange sky above you, you can feel the desperation 
of battle all around you.  You notice that the ground 
is all one solid mass with no dirt or rocks, far off 
you can see a mountain.  Suddenly it gets dark.  Now 
it begins to rain corpses, it appears a lone flying pod 
is going to land somewhere to the east after killing a 
swath through the cloud of monsters above you.

You find yourself on a ledge where it appears 
large dragons perch to protect Splynncryth's 
pyramid from invaders, but after looking up 
you wish dragons were your only problem. 
Hovering in the air before you is a 
gigantic metal ship with five dragon 
heads all staring at you intently.  The 
hatch is still partly down, maybe you can 
sprint into the ship and avoid the menacing 
dragon heads.....yeah right.....

the lone figure trying to fly the ship out of Splynn

raider, an interdimensional beings who only live for 
stealing.  Well you've decided his stealing days are 
over, in fact his breathing days are going to end too...
