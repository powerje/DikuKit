{BLUE,BO}The Beginning{blue,bo}~

  {GREEN,BO}Welcome to the land of Dagon.  This land has been 
  ruled by many{green,bo} {BLUE,BO}great{blue,bo} {YELLOW,BO}pharaohs{yellow,bo} {GREEN,BO}and many{green,bo} {RED,BO}evil{red,bo} {GREEN,BO}ones 
  also.  The land around you is a beautiful tropic 
  setting.  Luscious plants, towering{green,bo} {YELLOW}trees{yellow} {GREEN,BO}and all 
  types of{green,bo} {RED,BO}wild{red,bo} {GREEN,BO}animals are in this land.  To the 
  north is a beaten, rough, over grown path.  If you 
  choose to travel on, ahead lies a great journey.  
  If not, return to where you have traveled from.{green,bo}

  {BO,G}You have come to a {BO,W}clearing {BO,G}in the path.  To the

  water{BO,G} is coming from there.  To the south is 
  where you have traveled from.  The {BO,BLUE}decision{BO,G} on

  running toward you.

{BLACK,BO}A Narrow Passage{black,bo}~

  {BLACK,BO}You are standing in a narrow passage.  From what
  you can see from the walls, they are covered in
  cobwebs.  The hall is so dark that you can barely
  see.  Straight in front of you seems to be a light
  burning, with the walkway splitting into different
  directions.  You can still hear the voices coming 
  from behind you and many different noises are coming
  from ahead of you.{black,bo}

{BLACK,BO}The Doorway Between Life & Death{black,bo}~


    {BLACK,BO}Darkness surrounds all sides of you. Light
    has no existence here, all  is void.  The 
    ground is dark sand almost black.  Mountains 
    surround in all directions covering this plane.
    The only way to see the land seperate from the 
    sky of eternal night is the darker shades of 
    black.  Shadows in the form of people move fast 
    around you, whispering as the chase for their 
    home of eternal rest.  Chills fill your body as
    you stand here, you feel the life draining out
    of your body.{black,bo}
