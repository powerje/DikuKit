{bo,G}Dead End{bo}~
   
   The tunnel ends here.  The pipes continue on into the earth, but this
is as far as you can go.  High above your head there appears to be an 
air shaft, but the walls of the tunnel are far too slippery to climb.
You must turn back.

{bo,C}At the Bottom of the Well{bo}~
   
   You are standing at the bottom of an ancient well.  The cool air
flowing in from above is refreshing to your lungs.  Miraculously the
sludgy sewage water looks clear here.  It sparkles with a strange 
magical aura.  High above your head from out of the well you can hear
the incantations of magical tongues.  One side of the wall is crumbling
a bit, leaving you with plenty of foot holds to climb your way out.

{bo,G}Deep within the Stinky Sewers{bo}~
   
   Distant light from both the west and the east creeps into the
sewers, making visibility barely possible.  The undying rhythm of
dripping pipes and the noxious smell are nearly enough to drive
you insane.  The slimy green sludge cakes your equipment as you
trudge on through the shallow pools of waste.

{bo,G}The Sludgy Sewer{bo}~
   
   Your eyes can barely make out your surroundings as you trudge
onward through the murky water.  The stale air of decaying waste
cuts your breath short with every gasp.  The slow flowing stream
of sludge thickens beneath your feet as you try to walk.  An 
assortment of old, dripping pipes line the walls.

{bo,G}The Noxious Sewer{bo}~
   
   As you trudge on into the stagnent pools of sludge a foul
odor overtakes you.  The slimy water soaks you to the bone and
you nearly shiver.  You get a sinking feeling as you put your
foot forward into the standing water, but it finds the slimy
bottom safely and onward you go.

{BO,G}A Turn in the Sewer{bo}~
   
   The path of standing sewage seems to turns abruptly.  A wall of
green slime rises up before you.  It looks really slick!  The 
maddening smell of the splashing sewage drives you insane as you
trudge on through the murky waters.

{BO,G}A Smelly Sewer Passage{bo}~
   
   The light from above nearly blinds your diolated pupils.  As your vision
begins to clear you look up and high above your head a light shines in
from a storm drain.  As you take advantage of the light to look around, you
notice how extremely grimy it is down here.  The old pipes are rusting and
dripping.  The walls are covered with a mossy green slime.  Darkness
swallows up the light to the north, east and south.

{bo,G}A Steamy Section of Sewer{bo}~
   
   The air around you is increasingly hot and humid.  Large steam vents
blast you with hot air.  You begin to sweat.  To your disgust, the
sewage around you really, really stinks!  Small pools of boiling sewage
fill the air with noxious gas.

{BO,G}The Murky Sewer{bo}~
   
   The dull odor of decay is evident in the stale air.  The light quickly 
fades with each step you take, but you can still make out the green tinge 
of the diseased water.  It flows slowly to the south, emitting noxious 
fumes as it goes.

{bo,G}The Slimy Sewer{bo}~
   
   The smell of rotting stench from the sewage is nearly 
unbearable.  The air is stale and thick.  Small beams of light
shine into the sewer from above, making visibility just barely
possible.  Through a storm drain high overhead you swear you
can hear the sounds of people in Midgaard.  Maybe you should
yell for help, but what would they do?

{bo,G}Amidst the River of Sewage{bo}~
   
   The decaying waste of sludge flows slowly past your ankles.  It's 
rather deep and nearly fills your boots with sludge.  They feel heavy
and hard to walk in.  Perhaps you should empty them out soon, but what's
the point?  You'd just fill them up again.

{BO,G}The Grimy Sewer{bo}~
   
   The stale air is difficult to breath as you travel onward through the 
thickening sludge.  The sludge begins to flow quicker here and ripples are
clearly visible on the surface.  The roaring sounds of splashing water
nearly deafen you the farther to the south you go.  You better watch out,
the current is nearly strong enough to knock you off your feet.

{bo,G}Entrance to the Sewers{bo}~
   
   Pipes of all varieties line the walls of the sewer.  The pipes seem 
to go on indefinitely.  The air is cool and damp down here, almost thick 
to breath.  The light sound of echoing water from below is the only thing 
you can hear.  The darkness of the sewer is broken only by the rays of 
light shining in from the manhole above.  An old ladder leads up.

{BO,G}The Slimy Sewer{bo}~
   
   The shallow river of sewage flows slowly to the west as you trudge
onward through it's filth and stench.  The sludgy sewage cakes your
equipment much like it has caked the walls.  The foul stench that it
emits makes breathing a difficult, horrifying proccess.

{G,BO}A Turn in the Sewer{bo}~
   
   The air vents overhead give you enough light to see the sewer curving
ahead of you.  The walls and pipes are dripping and covered with a slimy
green moss.  The slow flowing sewage comes in from the south and flows 
to the east.

{bo,C}At the Bottom of the Well{bo}~
   
   The stale sewer air is replaced by a fresh breeze from above.  
You are standing in the bottom of an ancient well.  The sounds of
mystical ancient tongues floats in with the breeze from above. 
The well is obviously very old because it's stone wall is crumbling,
leaving you with ample footholds to climb out.

   You notice the slimy green sludge begins to move much faster here, 
and you realize that there is deeper layor beneath a large grate 
beneath your feet.  It is pitch black down there, so you better get 
out your flashlight.

{bo,G}The Slick Sewer{bo}~
   
   Beneath the stagnent pools of sewage, the concrete floor is extremely
slippery.  You nearly fall, but manage to recover your footing, turning 
another fresh wave of decaying stench.  The slimy walls around are a 
gruesome reminder of the effects of being in contact with sewage like this.
Your legs are just as slimy as the walls are though.  Arrrghh!

   The stale sewer air is replaced by a fresh breeze from above.  
You are standing in the bottom of an ancient well.  The sounds of
metal clashing with metal rings loudly from close above.  Battle
cries and screams of agony rain down from above.  The well is 
obviously very old because it's stone wall is crumbling, leaving 
you with ample footholds to climb out.

you can go.  You must turn back, unless you plan to dig for a few years.

   The walls of pipe and concrete are replaced with the large,
uneven bricks that form the base of the well.  Above you the 
fresh air brings the scent of death mingled with the scents of 
Midgaard.  The water here is murky and green, no different than 
the rest of the sewer.  You wonder if anyone knows what they 
are REALLY drinking!!!
