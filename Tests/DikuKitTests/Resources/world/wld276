{BO,BLUE}Video Store{bo,blue}~
As you walk into this bustling video store you are nerly run over by a
pair of bratty kids as they chase after each other.  A quick scan of the
store allows you to quickly locate what you have come after.  Directly
in the center of the building is a large display announcing the
re-release of the Star Wars Trilogy.  As you walk towards the display
the world around you begins to warp and twist.......your stomach churns
as you continue to stumble towards the display............

You wake up to find yourself lying face down on a baking rock!
Looking around you realize that you have absolutely no idea where
you are!  These barren wastelands seem to stretch on forever, miles
and miles of hard rock and sand.  To the north, at the very edge of
your vision, you can barely make out a large, man-made object.

You enter this ice cave thanking the gods for being merciful and
providing you with shelter from the storm raging outside.  Huge
stalactites hang from the ceiling......not only that, frozen bodies
are also hanging...dead!  Maybe this isn't such a good place to be.
As you turn around to leave the cave you hear a thunderous roar and
see thousands of pounds of ice and snow tumble down to block off
your only exit.  Oh sh*t.......

laser beams as they ricochet down the hallway.

       Without warning the entire ceiling gives way.....the first chunk
       of ice hits you full in the back, knocking you down.  The next
       cracks off your skull, smashing it into the icy floor.  After that
       you lose track of the ice boulders as they batter your body.

Rahvin's Loft~
You are standing in Rahvin's private chamber.  The room is small, but very
comfortable looking.  You see a king-sized bed with two cats curled up on
it pushed up against the far wall, along with a shelf filled with books and
other trinkets from around the world.  A small writing desk cluttered with
papers is on the east wall, and on the west wall there is a comfortable
loveseat.  Other than the desk, everything appears to be very neat and
organized.

The Common Room~
You enter a crowded bar filled with dozens of people, both young and old.  At
first glance there is nothing to distinguish this bar from any other, but as
time passes you begin to notice a disturbing pattern.  Every one of the bar's
patrons wears a slightly glazed look on his or her face, and every one of them
go through the same routine over and over and over.....nothing ever changes.
The only person in here without that blank expression is a tall, dark man
robed in pitch black.  He walks around the bar with an amused expression on
his face.  After serveral minutes the mysterious man seems to take notice of
you.  As he approaches you see a faint smirk cross his face and then disappear
just as quickly.   "I am Rahvin", he tells you in a dark voice, "Welcome to
my bar.  How may I help you?"   With a flick of his wrist a tall mug of ale
appears before you.  You take a small sip and all goes blank............
