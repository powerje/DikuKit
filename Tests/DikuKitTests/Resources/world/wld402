Entertainment Room.~

         You are standing in an 
         entertainment room. 
         In the corner is a couch 
         and tv. Hooked up to the 
         tv you see a Old Nintendo ({BLUE}NES{blue}), 
         a Super Nintendo ({RED}SNES{red}) and 
         a Nintendo 64({CYAN}N64{cyan}).

NES~
        
        
        The Nintendo Entertainment System has
        been around for many years. Currently
        the system has over 250 games in existence.
        But due to not all the games being as popular
        as Zelda  I am not going to do all 250 games.
        While in the NES you will have a choice of
        Playing the Legend of Zelda. (Levels 1-30 Duel)
        Or the Legend of Zelda II  The Adventure of Link.
        Levels (30-50 Duel)

        to the east you see many bushes.
        To the north you see some rocks.

A path to level 4~
        
        This room is full of bushes. 
        There is also a big section of lake.
        Be happy and take a few to rest 
        because this room is empty.

The room before level 4.~
        
        The waters of lake Zora are 
        looking rather disturbing. It 
        almost makes you want to wait
        before your next main boss type mob. 
        After much mental debate and maby 
        some greed your decide to press on.

Two-Headed Gleeok's domain (level 4)~
        
        This room has a lot of junk 
        and rusted armor laying about. 
        The armor was once worn by 
        mighty warriors trying to obtain 
        the treasure of the two Two-Headed Gleeok.

After a long battle~
        
        After a long and annoying battle 
        with the Gleeok you feel 
        releaved to get back to the 
        simpler mobs in the zone.

     You peer around and you see the classiest arrangement of
     junk and trash you've  ever seen.  The stench fills your
     nostrils and  you  back away quickly.  To  your left you
     notice  an  alleyway with  junkies  sitting in  a  group
     around a flaming trash barrel.
