Somewhere in Kansas~

  A cold gust of wind blows through the trees, branches bend
and the leaves rustle as the wind blows steadily harder.
You look west at the darkening sky, the clouds have  become
a shroud of gloom closing in on the Kansas prairie. Perhaps you
could seek shelter in the farmhouse you see in the distance.

On a road to Kansas~

  A cold wind continues to blow across the prairie, kicking up
dust and bringing the pungent smell of the farm to your nose.
Several horses graze nearby and you can hear the grunting 
and squealing of the pigs kept by the big barn. On top of the 
barn you seem a large weather vane.

The Barnyard~

   As you wander the barnyard. It is dry, barren of grass, it looks 
as if its in need of a good rain. You are surrounded by the sounds 
and smells coming from the farm. To the west you hear sounds of 
peeping chicks, the coming storm seems to have them very agitated. 
As the winds from the north grow stronger you catch the 
unmistakeable aroma of pigs.

A Chicken Coop~

  A weathered wooden coop, it seems to be barely standing on it's 
own. You peek inside and you see a new brood of chicks. Small, yellow
balls of fluff.  They peep and peck for food.

The Barnyard~


   As you wander the barnyard. It is dry, barren of grass, it looks 
as if its in need of a good rain. You are surrounded by the sounds
and smells coming from the farm. To the east you see several pens 
filled with pigs The coming storm seems to have them very agitated
In the back of the pen, you see a huge sow,suckling several piglets. 
A thin trickle of water that has leaked from the trough runs under 
the fence, reeking of rotten food and pig waste.

A Pig Sty~
   
   As you glance inside the pig sty you notice the pigs have used 
their water trough to make a big mud hole to roll in to cool
themselves from the recent dry spell on the farm. You feel a bite on
your arm from a fly drawn in by the stench from the pen. Moving 
farther into the pen causes the pigs to scatter, raising a cloud of
flies and stench.

A Pig Sty~

   Walking closer to the pen you see the largest of all the pigs 
here. A Fat Sow has recently delivered her litter of small pink 
babies. You stand on the bottom board of the pig pen to get a closer
view. You watch as she seems to quietly sleep and feed her young. A 
gnat bites through your pants and you reach down to scratch,you lose
your footing and slip. The sow lifts her head and jumps to her feet
and begins to run towards you.

The Barnyard~

   The air smells cleaner as the wind from the storm picks up. 
The few trees bend and sway from the gusting winds. Feeling the strong
gust of cold wind you run for shelter. To the west sits a lovely 
farm house, to the north a barn,

The Gale Farm~

   The Gale family farm house looks tired but sturdy. Rough wood, 
paint worn away by time and weather. Shutters on the windows are
open now, flapping in the wind. A rusty old screen door opens
in sudden gust of wind, then slams shut again with a loud bang.
You shout out, but no one seems to be at home. The wind blows 
even stronger its time to take cover.

special occasions and those Sunday chicken dinners. There is a large
table and eight high backed chairs. The table is dressed with a
crisp white tablecloth.  Hickory, the farmhand sits at the end of 
the table eating some crullers.

at the window, matched by the tufted coverlet on the small bed.
A bench by the window holds many dolls and stuffed bears. Looking 
around you see a gumball machine  on the dresser.  Standing at the 
window you see a rose trellis attached to the side of the house.

Walking by Rainbow Pond~

     Stopping to rest a moment..you tire from so much running. Looking
around you need to find a place that is safe, there must be such a place.
 Behind the moon- beyond the rain..

Somewhere, over the rainbow, way up high. There's a land that I heard of
once in a lullaby.  Somewhere, over the rainbow, skies are blue and the dreams
that you dare to dream really do come true.  Someday I'll wish upon a star and
wake up where the clouds are far behind me.  Where troubles melt like lemondrops,
away above the chimney tops that's where you'll find me. Somewhere, over the 
rainbow, bluebirds fly. Birds fly over the rainbow,  why then- oh, why can't I? 
If  happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow, why, oh, why can't I?

A Campsite~

     Coming up on the campfire there is a wagon parked close to the trees. 
A sign on the side of it reads.. Professor Marvel's Traveling Show, 
Mystic to all the Crowned Heads of Europe.  Sitting by the fire is a man 
cooking a hot dog on a stick, he gestures to you to join him. He tells you of 
his travels and offers to read the crystal for you. Gazing into his crystal ball
he sees a farm and a woman clutching her chest.  You feel you must go back. 
The wind begins to whirl around you and it looks like bad weather ahead.

 has made a bed for her new kittens.

Up in the Hayloft~

     Walking around the loft  you hear all kinds of creaking and
 popping sounds. It feels as if some of the boards in the loft to 
give way at any time.

     You quickly approach the farm, you see a dark funnel cloud making its
 way towards the ground. The wind has grown stronger and debris is flying
 in every direction. You manage to get to the door and run back to your room for safety.
