A winding pathway~

  The forest trail turns away from the main path through
  the woods, leading off towards the north. Silent trees
  covered in Spanish Moss stand guard on either side of
  the path, while the dense underbrush prevents travel to the
  east or west. It is ominously quiet here, not even the
  sound of birds can be heard.

  My dear colleagues,
    Our worst fears have come true, I am afraid. The
    cult of Tiaech has regained strength. Many of our
    fellow clerics have fallen sway to his evil power,
    while those who have resisted have been slaughtered.
    I have entrusted Angendar with a mission of utmost
    importance to take our most valuable scrolls to a
    place where it is my hope they will be safe. I pray
   that we can turn the tide of recent events. 
   Dark days are ahead of us, I fear. Rumors are starting
   to trickle in that...
