Third web.~
  Large rocks thrust up from the ground. They make it easy for creatures
to hide. You are starting to see why this is called the web. All rooms
are connected in a web formation. As confusing as it get you are still
amazed by the formation. This is the perfect place for monsters from the
screen to come to life. Boo!

  It seems as if you have reached the outer rim of the web. One could
probably run around in circles all day if he wanted to. What is down
here? Sure you see monsters like gremlins and critters, but who is
running the show? It has to be someone. Maybe someone from your dreams.
Someone who haunts the dreams of everyone. Maybe........

A deep hole.~
  The light above slowly disappears as you descend further into the hole.
The walls of this tunnel seem to shed a soft glow that draws you further
down into unknown depths. There is a sense of relief that the screams have
above have stopped.....but what could be worse than those screams!

When you look down you see a large boulder wedged between some rocks. A 
delicate flow of air seems to be making its way up around it.

 The wall seems almost crystal like in its texture. It would seem as though
ice is flowing under the wall surface. This could explain the cold

 When you look east you see blue moss hanging off the walls in irregular

A deep hole.~
  The air gets colder as you drop under the boulder above. The soft glow
is getting brighter. littered around the room are decaying bones and 
rotten flesh. Flesh of what though!

bones~
 This is a large thigh bone about 3 feet in length. On closer examination
you see gnawing marks on the bones where tissue use to be. It would seem
that something in here has a desire for flesh.
~
E
flesh~
  The flesh is nothing more than a pile of gore. It has the sickly smell
of blood. You can see the blood stains on the wall that skid down to the
pile. All you can figue is whatever was gnawing on those bones was not 
concerned about neatness, when it was stripping the flesh from the victim.

probably run around in circles all day if he wanted to. What is down
here? Sure you see monsters like gremlins and critters, but who is
running the show? It has to be someone. Maybe someone from your dreams.

Deeper you go.~
  This hole seems to go down forever. A damp breeze slowly makes its way
up to brush your face. Funny it doesn't seem as though as many monsters
are down here.....wonder why....

A small landing.~
  You have come down to a dark landing. Metal pipes stick out from the
walls and seem to run down the cavern. You an here the steady hissing of
steam and feel the heat as sweat begins to form. From somewhere you can
hear the high pitch squeak of metal on metal....

Passage in the Caverns.~
  The squeal seems to get louder the closer you get. It is like the noise
of fingernails on a chalkboard. But a new noise is starting to surface
with the other. It almost sounds like a chainsaw. Why a chainsaw?

Intersection.~
  The humming of the chainsaw seems strongest to the south. You can
almost feel the blade cutting, it seems so loud. There are small little
holes to the east and west that seem to want exploring. The steam from
the pipes has also created a dim fog down here.

A hole.~
  This small hole seems large enough for only one person. The room almost
looks like a closet of sorts. There are buckets and mops laying around
and a skipping rope lying in the middle of the floor. In you head you can
hear a little girls voice singing. "One, Two, Freddies comig for you,
Three, Four, Better lock the door,.......".

Entrance to the Boiler room.~
  The buzzing has reached a climax of noise. You can see the weapon
shining off your light. It seems to appear and disappear in the mist. You
lose it......Then it appears in a flash with its wielder. He is alive
after all those movies. Yes here before you with leather mask is no other
Leatherface, slayer of all living.

The Boiler Room.~
  It seems as though you have come to a dead end. Infront of you is a
massive boiler which must supply heat to the entire caverns. The walls
seem a little distorted and moving. After closer examination you realise
that the wall is made up of faces young and old. They groan and moan in
torment from the capturing of their souls. Then like a cat a man appears
before you. He is wearing a brown hat and stripped sweater. The most
noticable feature is the strange knife glove on his one hand. Then you
remember....This is Freddy, ruler of dreams and destroyer of souls.
Freddy is in charge of all this madness...and he seems right at home!

  You have entered the Leprechauns lair. It is filled with gold and other
items collected over the years. The leprechaun is sitting waiting in his
chair for you. Time to say hello.
