{R}Entrance To Koilos{r}~

{WH}   You've struggled across a vast open desert to the fabled
{WH}   ruins of Koilos, just as Mishra and Uzra did so many years
{WH}   ago. Scattered around you are the rusted and pitted remains
{WH}   of ancient Thran artifacts. Mountains block the way east
{WH}   and west, but a large archway beckons to the north. Perhaps
{WH}   there you will find adequate rewards for your travels.

{BOLD,BLACK}A Deep Dark Tunnel{bold,black}~
 
{BOLD,BLACK}   The first ten feet or so of this tunnel appear to be made of
{BOLD,BLACK}   sandstone. Beyond that, the rough rocks give way to a smooth,
{BOLD,BLACK}   polished surface. Close inspection of the walls reveals that
{BOLD,BLACK}   they are seamlessly constructed of small blocks of granite.
{BOLD,BLACK}   The precision of the craftsmanship reminds you of machines.

{WHITE}Main Chamber{white}~
 
{WHITE}   You enter a large central chamber with natural rock walls,
{WHITE}   supported by ancient steel and pillars. The chamber is
{WHITE}   littered with machines of the same Thran design as the
{WHITE}   Su-Chi, but well-oiled and polished as though created only
{WHITE}   moments ago. The ceiling plates give off an ambient glow,
{WHITE}   and small balls of radiance dance around some of the
{WHITE}   machinery, orbiting them like small moons.

{WHITE}   In the center of this great cavern sits an enormous power
{WHITE}   stone, unmarred by age and unbroken by accident. Its facets
{WHITE}   are perfect, smooth, and reflective, and sharp enough to cut
{WHITE}   through reality itself. The power stone rests on a low
{WHITE}   platform flanked by mirrors, which in turn are attached by
{WHITE}   wires to various machines around the perimeter. The power
{WHITE}   stone could simply be for the lights, or perhaps it is for
{WHITE}   something more...

{BOLD,BLACK}The Metal Book{bold,black}~
 
{WHITE}   A smooth tablet of metal shaped like the cover of a book
{WHITE}   lays open before you. The pages of the book are made of
{WHITE}   metal and glass. It is impossible to determine whether this
{WHITE}   object is an artifact from the Thran's time or if it came
{WHITE}   from elsewhere entirely. Maybe the answer can be found in
{WHITE}   the book.

{BO,BL}Path Through The Swamp{bo,bl}~
 
{BO,BL}   Venturing through this dismal swamp, an overwhelming sense
{BO,BL}   of gloom begins to set in. You have the uneasy feeling that
{BO,BL}   you're being watched. Better to keep moving than to wait and
{BO,BL}   see what those dark shadowy figures looming in the mist are.

{BO,BL}Standing Before Castle Sengir{bo,bl}~
 
{BO,BL}   A black stone castle looms above you. Its tall spindly
{BO,BL}   towers stretch high into the sky. Even from the ground,
{BO,BL}   large archways are visible in the upper reaches of the
{BO,BL}   towers. Three stone statues of horned beasts are spaced
{BO,BL}   evenly along the castle wall above the gate.

{BO,BL}The Parlor{bo,bl}~
 
{BO,BL}   The richness of the decor is astounding. Elaborate silk
{BO,BL}   tapestries cover dark stone walls polished to a mirror-like
{BO,BL}   finish. Plush velvet chairs and couches form a large half
{BO,BL}   circle near the center of the room. The other furniture is
{BO,BL}   made of a wood so dark it looks like ebony. Intricately
{BO,BL}   carved doorways made of the same wood lead to darkened
{BO,BL}   rooms east and south.

{BO,BL}   been kept clean. Perhaps it is used for guests. An oversized
{BO,BL}   canopy bed dominates the room, and there is an armoire in
{BO,BL}   one corner of the room. Heavy black drapes keep even the

{BO,BL}   This enormous room is unique in its lack of adornment. In
{BO,BL}   stark contrast to the other rooms in the castle, this room
{BO,BL}   is very drab. A large rough-hewn table surrounded by about
{BO,BL}   twenty chairs is the only furniture int he room. A half-
{BO,BL}   eaten meal of some very bloody meat remains on the table.

{BO,BL}   A large spiral staircase winds its way toward the top of the
{BO,BL}   tower. Large scratches have been gouged into the sides from
{BO,BL}   years of use. As you get ready to begin your climb, you feel
{BO,BL}   something warm and wet splatter against your cheek. You rub
{BO,BL}   the wetness away with your hand and you realize that it's
