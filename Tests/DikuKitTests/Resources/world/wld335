   {BO,CYAN}Well, here you are, back in Market Square.
   {bo,YELLOW}Things seem a little weird, but no more than usual.
   The cool Midgaard air breathes in from all directions,
   refreshing you with every breath you take.
   {bo,MAGENTA}There's the occasional fido and street cleaner...
   And, of course, those annoying drunks you just want to kill.{bo}

  Eerie.....{bo}

{BO,CYAN}The Entrance to the Cleric's Guild{bo}~

  {BO,WHITE}You are on the outskirts of one
  of the many guilds in Midgaard.
  In front of you stands a big,
  hulking man, blocking your
  entry. He seems quite focused,
  you're sure he doesn't like
  being disturbed.

  {bo,WHITE}If you want to get into the
  guild, perhaps you could sneak
  past him? That sword he's holding
  looks awful sharp...{bo}

{BO,RED}Slive's Hideout{bo}~

   {bo,CYAN}A slithering essence pervades
   the room when you realize you've
   entered the lair of the elusive
   {BO,GREEN}Slive, {bo,CYAN}Midgaard's master of mischief.

   {BO,BLACK}His superior agility makes your
   skin crawl, and you know this
   fight won't be easy against the
   originator of the vile profession
   known as the {BO,YELLOW}assassin.....

   {BO,CYAN}Maybe you should go back to newbie school!!{bo}

{BO,WHITE}The Temple Square{bo}~

   {CYAN}You are now north of Market
   Square, on your way to the
   altar...

   {BO}Something seems a little strange,
   however... perhaps you shouldn't
   go there... you could always go to
   the hotel and rent out instead.{bo}

{BO,WHITE}Behind the {BO,RED}Sac{BO,WHITE}red Altar{bo}~

   {BO,BLUE}You are standing behind an altar
   normally used for ritual sacrifices.
   The priest is standing here and looks
   quite busy with his work.

   {BLACK}The framework of the altar looks
   delicately furnished, and the walls
   seem somewhat weak...
   Perhaps upon further inspection you
   could find something of use.

   {bo,C}There is a sign here written in blood: {BO,RED}Read it!{bo}
