{bo,Y}Native Guide's Hut{bo}~

{Y}  You enter a well lit mud-daub hut. There is an old desk in
{Y}  the corner with many lose, dusty papers lying on it. The
{Y}  wall are covered with winkled faded charts and maps. There
{Y}  is a large, handsome black man sitting at the desk with his
{Y}  feet up. Gambit watches you with a practiced eye, and you
{Y}  hope you measure up. There is a small name plate slightly
{Y}  askew on the desk with "GAMBIT - BUSHMAN and GUIDE FOR
{Y}  HIRE".

{WH,BO}  You are in a very smooth round tunnel. It seems to be made

{WH,BO}  used to it. You have no idea what you'll find at the end of
{WH,BO}  this tunnel but you almost hope its that '{b}{R}evil{WH,BO}' you were

             I hope you are enjoying my area. It should be alot of
             fun and there are NO dt's. Also, feel free to map it
             out.. it has no wrapping exits and it can be mapped
             quite easily.
 
                         Enjoy,
                             Stroff.

{bo,R}Treasure Room{bo}~

{BLA,BO}  This room is filled with an odd assortment of items some
{BLA,BO}  look very powerful and others look rather cheap and gaudy..
{BLA,BO}  but one can never be sure. The room has been carved smoothly
{BLA,BO}  out of black granite and you feel sure that there would be
{BLA,BO}  no way to break in or out of here without the proper key.
{BLA,BO}  There is no obvious source of illumination, but the room is
{BLA,BO}  amply lit. It could almost be considered comfy if you could
{BLA,BO}  rid thought of mousetraps from your mind.{b}

{bo,R}Guard Room{bo}~

{R}  This room is very dark and along each wall is a row of dark
{R}  objects that appear to be statues. The floors are cold
{R}  marble, a stark contrast from the carpeted floor of the
{R}  royal chambers. Your breath comes out in visible clouds and
{R}  as your eyes adjust you can make out a faint glowing
{R}  inscription on the floor that reads: Guard Room. You have a
{R}  very sudden urge to leave.{b}

{BO,Y}Royal Chambers{bo}~

{M}  You are standing in the royal chambers. This room looks
{M}  identical to the anteroom except it is about 100 feet in
{M}  diameter. The room is bare except for a small wooden chair
{M}  sitting in the very middle of the room. It looks very out of
{M}  place. Always at the edge of your vision the air seems to
{M}  ripple with darkness, and as you snap your head towards it
{M}  the effect vanishes. As you let your surroundings sink in
{M}  you start to feel weaker and your will escapes your grasp.
{M}  You dimly realize that to spend too much time in this room
{M}  would be death.{b}

{BO,W}Anteroom{bo}~

{M}  You are standing in the anteroom that measures 50' by 50' -
{M}  this should be a physical impossibility since the hut looked
{M}  only about 30' in diameter. The walls are about ten feet
{M}  high and there is no ceiling, only a view into a {BLA,BO}s{WH,BO}t{BLA,BO}a{WH,BO}r{BLA,BO}l{WH,BO}i{BLA,BO}t
{M}  {WH,BO}s{BLA,BO}k{WH,BO}y{b}{M}. As you study the constellations you realize that there
{M}  is no way those are the constellations as they look from
{M}  earth. The floor and walls are covered in thick, ornate
{M}  tapestries that would seem more at home in a {Y}Persian castle
{M}  then an African village. These tapestries uniformly depict
{M}  scenes of death and desolation. There is nothing else in the
{M}  room except for the way in and a small door leading to the
{M}  south.

{bo,Y}Inside the mud-daub hut{bo}~

{BLA,BO}  You are standing in a {WH,BO}darkened hut{BLA,BO}. The walls seem very
{BLA,BO}  thick, and the air is {WH,BO}cool. The on{BLA,BO}ly light filters dimly
{BLA,BO}  through the thatch roof and yo{WH,BO}u can feel the dirt{BLA,BO} floor
{BLA,BO}  beneath your feet. To one side{WH,BO} of this round hut {BLA,BO}are the
{BLA,BO}  remains of some broken furnitu{WH,BO}re, covered with du{BLA,BO}st from

Behind this omnious looking door, smells of sickeningly
sweet perfume waft to your nostril.  You can also smell
a disturbing odor... an odor of... death?

Your face pale and you tremble at what might be behind this
door...

A note reads:  BEWARE!  If you're not in a strong group, don't
even THINK about entering this place!!!!

Kill the Flag~
You are standing in the middle of square, white room. It is devoid of 
decoration save for a a piece of cream coloured cardboard somehow
fastened to the wall. You can just make out the text at the very top 'Rules'.
You feel that you should wait here until the immort being running this
quest tells you to move, or leave.

                      Rules for the Kill the Flag Quest
              ------------------------------------------------
 
 Kill the flag is a variation on capture the flag which I'm sure all of you
 have played at one point before being sucked into NCMud ;)
 
 The Basics:
 
   * You need at least four people on each team (else its too boring)
   * There are two teams, Team A and Team B. Each team has a mob called
     (surprise!) FLAGA and FLAGB
   * Team A uses gossip channel TSN (type: channel tsn)
   * Team B uses gossip channel ESP (type: channel esp)
   * Team A needs to kill Team B's mob (called FLAGB) and Team B needs
     to kill Team A's Mob (called FLAGA)
   * No PKilling is Allowed.
   * You can spell other players with Blindess, Guiness, Sleep, Summon,
     Charm, Flash, Sink, Scare, and Laughing Gas.

{bo,Y}African Plains{bo}~

{Y}  All around you the parched grass stretches towards the
{Y}  horizons. {G}W{BLA,BO}i{b}{G}t{BLA,BO}h{b}{G}e{BLA,BO}r{b}{G}e{BLA,BO}d {b}{G}t{BLA,BO}r{b}{G}e{BLA,BO}e{b}{G}s {Y}struggling for existence appear in
{Y}  scattered clumps. Their {R}l{Y}e{R}a{Y}v{R}e{Y}s are dried and brown and you
{Y}  wonder how they are able to survive. To the far, far north a
{Y}  huge {BLU,BO}grey-blue mountain range {C}cuts the {WH,BO}sky{b}{Y}. The wind on your
{Y}  back seems to chill you, even though its a dry 35 degrees.
{Y}  Sitting in the undulating grass seemingly unaffected by you
{Y}  all that exists is one lonely, dehydrated ancient man. His
{Y}  dry, crinkled dark brown skin fits poorly on his thin,
{Y}  peaceful, frame. He is clothed in nothing but a dull brown
{Y}  loin cloth that may have been an animal skin or primitive
{Y}  cloth. His {BLA,BO}jet black eyes {b}{Y}seem to drink your soul.{b}
