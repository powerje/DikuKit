   Hmm... it seems this is the place that everyone's talking about. It looks
like it's pretty happening, with some really, REALLY good looking people here
to check things out! Man.. you better hurry up and catch some of this action
before it's all gone. And look.. it's collage pub night too: only level 35
Avatars and below allowed in. By the looks of this big bouncer, he's here to
make sure that of that too!

{MAGENTA}{BOLD}The beginning{magenta}{bold} {BLUE}of a really, really long line{blue}~
   Wouldn't you know it, a line up! Well, what can you expect from a club!
Everyone seems to be ready for some serious partying. From behind the wall,
the deep bass thud of dance music continuously pounds away. It seems like this
is really the place to be. Now if you can just get past this line...

   Hey, that wasn't so hard! Best of all, the wait wasn't that long. If the
rest of this line is going to be this easy, you should be joining the party
rather quickly! But, looking at the line up, it doesn't seems like it's going
to be as easy as the first. Well.. you've started, and considering the line
up that has formed behind you, there's no real way you're turning back anyways!

{MAGENTA}{BOLD}Moving{magenta}{bold} {BLUE}along the line{blue}~
    As you get closer to the front of the line, the music seems to get clearer
and the bass, even louder! You can hear the yells and shouts of a pretty
jumpin' party! Thankfully, the line's moving pretty well.. but not well 
enough for your tastes! You can feel the rhythm in your bones and taste the
sweet alchohol on your lips. I guess this line's gonna need a little 
"friendly" persuesion.

   Finally, you can actually see the front of the line up from here. Maybe
this line wasn't so bad after all. However, there's a few people left that 
are in your way from having a truely good time! You can hear the music
calling you from here, like a mermaid's call, drawing you closer and
closer to the front. Well, a little pushing and shoving never hurt anyone,
except the people in front of you!

absolutely huge and jammed packed tonight too. Everything seems to blow 
your mind: the loud music, the pumping bass, the light and laser show and
best of all, all the people! Now it's time for some fun. The better 
question now is where to start.

At the lounge entrance~
     You approach the entrance of the lounge, with the usual assortment
of pool players, on-lookers and people just chillin'. In the distance
you notice a large crowd gathered around one pool table. Something must
be exciting in there to stir such a commotion. To the west, you notice
the bathroom, where, by the sounds of things, it ain't a pleasent place
to visit. Damn, and some jerk locked the door and stole the key. Until
you find the key, you'll never know what's in there! Maybe someone in
that crowd knows where that key went

    You stand before the heart of the club, the dance floor. You look
at what seems to be an endless sea of people, all grooving to the latest
jams. From the size of the dance floor and the amount of people on it,
you figure its pretty east to get lost. I'd watch your step in there,
'cause you may never know where you're gonna end up!

people getting quiet personal with each other over drinks, getting to 
know each other better. Hmmmm.. they seem quite annoyed at you for 
interupting their private moment.

    Yet another private little corpner of the club, just overlooking the
dancefloor. A few people are gathered here, sharing in idle talk, having
a drink or two and getting very intimite. They seem kinda busy, so maybe
they don't wanna be disturbed. However, they will make a little time
to discuss this little intrusion though.

you find yourself in front of a large stack of speakers. The bass they're
cranking out starts to make your chest hurt and your head pound. You look

dancing up a storm up here, and giving all the guys below a great "show".
She looks over and stares at you with her glazed eyes and says "What are

of the booth. From here, the club looks even bigger than before and
several times more crowded. After considering all the work you've gone

jumpin' till the next day. The boys at the turntables seem hard at work
cueing up the next tune. With one ear in a headphone and a hand on the
tables, they turn to you and stare with very unwelcome eyes. Maybe they

this is where all the MC's do their thang, keeping the party happening!
Infront of you is a large control board, with a mic to make those shouts
out to the crowds! You think about saying "Yo" to the crowds when you notice
the MC look evily at you. It doesn't seem like she likes you touching
her mic.

At the catwalk entrance~
    At this corner of the DJ booth, away from all the glamour and gliz, is 
the most ignored part of the club. Beer bottles, papers and junk litter
this entire area, generally making it a mess. No wonder nobody really 
works in this portion of the booth. Just above is the catwalk, interconnecting
all the Gogo dancer's platforms together. Hmmm.. I wonder what they do
up there besides dance up a storm..

On the catwalk~
    WOW! Is the view from here great or what! The whole club can be seen
from WAY up here! You seem to be standing on a small, but decently stable
catwalk. With every step you take, it creaks and sways ever so slighty,
causing you to lose confidence in the integrity of your footing. No 
wonder they only made this thing for one person at a time. Additional
weight would probably break this thing in two, and it seems like a REAL
far fall until ya hit the bottom too.

A Gogo dancer's platform~
    You find yourself looking over the entire crowd of people jamming away
to the funky grooves that's being pumped out. From here, everyone has a 
pretty damn good view of ya. I guess this why these Gogo dancers are putting 
on the show that they do! They look pretty comfortable, dancing away in those
skin tight outfits. Those strips of clothing doesn't leave much for the 
imagination. However, they are VERY fit and thier bodies look like they
just won't quit! You'll just have to see how well they fight...

On a connecting catwalk~
    After stepping off the Gogo platform, you reach another catwalk,
which seems even less sturdy than the last. It continues to sway and rock
on those old and aging chains. Better watch your step and play it safe,
since you'll never know when this thing will just snap.

the front and the sides, forming a make-shift cage. Although the platform
is slightly different, the dancers are basically the same. Each of them
is dressed, if you can really call that dressed, like those dancers you
just dealt with. They look over to you and say "HEY! Only dancers are 
allowed up here!!" Jeez, the attitude on these ones. Better teach 'em...

Last bit of the catwalk~
    Now you've completely lost confidence in the construction of the
catwalk by now. If it wasn't for the rust, there wouldn't be anything
holding it together. Count your prayers, since it seems that only faith
is keeping this thing from falling. Better make your move quick, or it
just may be the last move you make

The last Gogo dancer~
    You've reached yet another platform, fairly similar in comparision.
This one, however, it almost over the middle of the dancefloor, suggesting
that this platform is where the main dancers perform. The crowd seems to
have a great view of the entire platform, as well as anyone who'd be 
performing on it. And what a sight they'd have too! These dancers, dressed
even skimppier than the previous ones, have figures that put the rest to
shame. Don't stare too long at them, though! They're gorgious and they
know it too! Caught peeking too long may just end up in a whole world of
pain.

    Jeez, I wonder what all the activity's about?! Must be someone cleaning
up on the tables. If you could just get a little closer, you may just be
able to make out what's going on. However, this crowd don't look too willing

    From this spot, you can get a better idea of what's going on and
what everyone's watching. Some guy's playing 9 ball and is just cleaning
up! Then again, his competition doesn't look too hard. Maybe you should
try giving it a shot. How hard can it be, right? Now if you could just
get a little closer to the table itself.

On the pool table~

     So now you have the chance to show them what you're really made of!
But it seemed a few people heard ya braggin' about how good ya are, so
your opponent wants to call your shots! He wants you to play it like this:

1 Ball, 5 Ball in the North East Corner pockets
2 Ball in the West side pocket
3 Ball and 7 Ball in the South East Corner pockets
4 Ball and 8 Ball in the North West Corner pockets
6 Ball in the East side pocket
and the 9 Ball in the South West Corner pocket

Also, he won't let you sink the 9 ball in first to win, so you've got quite
the challange before ya! Good luck...

action. The felt is kinda worn down, yet the table remains very true. To
both the east and the west are the corner pokets. To the north of here
you notice the coin return slot. Hey! That just may be way outta here!
You just gotta find a way to jimmy that slot and you're home free!

How hard can that be?! Heck, there's a pocket here, just waiting for the
right ball. It should be easy, but don't get too cocky now, you still 
gotta win this game first. The last thing you want to do is mess up and
make some kinda of stupid mistake. And with all these people looking on,
a mistake could be very embarrassing, and costly.

and tear are evident in this corner as well. Regadless, what still works
and what counts the most right now, are the pockets! Two of them lie to
the south and the east of here. Just make sure you don't scratch now!
Sinking the white ball means you lose, and losing ain't a good thing! 
Anyways, you gotta sink those other balls first, so forget about the cue 
for now. Playing with the cue ball won't win you this game!

    Damn that was easy! No sweat right?! Finished the game and he didn't
even get a chance to shoot. Boy, did you show him who's da king at pool.
And by the murmers and giggles in the crowd, they're kinda happy you won
too. Nothing like showing up some punk like him. However, this "punk" 
doesn't seem to handle loss very gracefully. The expression on his face
would be a testiment to the anger he has inside. He turns and says "NOBODY
makes a fool of me and lives to tell about it!!" Is he ticked off or what?!
I guess you'll just have to show him how to fight tonight, as well as how
to play pool.

between concenting adults. Maybe load up on one, just in case you get a 
little lucky tonight. But this machine looks like its been abused in the

About the VIP Lounge~
     In comparision with the rest of the club, this place is empty. A
few people can be seen at the bar, to your eest, or having a casual drink
while overlooking the dancefloor, to the west. It seems, though, there's
nothing really ahead of you but lonely tables and empty shot glasses. It
seems everyone else is attracted to the other "activity". Regardless, the
thought of pulling up a chair and taking a load off is pretty tempting.
It's been a long night and you haven't sat since you got here. As 
comforting as the thought may be, those shot glasses don't look normal, 
since they're trying to kill you now. I guess now's definately not the
best time in the world to have a rest.

Looking over the dancefloor~
   This part of the lounge seems to go very well with the rest of the 
lounge itself: marble tables, leather sofas.. very luxurious stuff for a
night club. You begin to approach the railing, which creates a kind of
balcony to overlook much of the dancefloor. The view is pretty decent and
the music still comes in crystal clear, so it makes this area an ideal 
place to kick back and relax a little. From the looks of things, that's
what alot of people are doing now: relaxing and having a few drinks. Funny
this is, though, you haven't had a drink yet and funny things are starting
to happen. I mean, if you didn't know better, you'd swear those empty 
glasses are moving on their own...

In front of the bar~
    The crowd around the bar seems pretty set on getting their drinks. 
Although not pushing and shoving, like some people, they're definately not
going to let anyone in ahead of them. They want their booze and they want
it now. Most of them seem pretty cool, having only one or two drinks so 
far. They don't look overly upset or anything, but I wouldn't push it.
From what you can see of the bar, it's pretty long, with many bartenders
running back and forth, serving each paying customer. Their selection seems
pretty good, one of the best so far. Decisions, decisions! Maybe if you
get a little closer to the bar, you may just be able to see if anything
catches your fancy.

About the VIP Lounge~
     From the empty glasses and solitary tables, it would seem that
whoever was drinking here before has since left. And from all those 
empty glasses, whoever was here was a heavy drinker. The table seems full
of empty shot and cocktail glasses. Looking around the lounge, you notice
that everyone has stayed away from the middle of lounge. They're probably
doing something else, drinking at the bar or working up a sweat on the 
dancefloor. Regardless, like alot of the glasses in this lounge, they're
not normal, since they're turning to you.. probably wanting to kill you.

Looking over the dancefloor~
    From here, you have a rather comfortable and pleasent view of the
dancefloor and all the action on it. You're surrounded by tables, all
tastefully chosen to match the posh VIP lounge decor, and matching chairs
and sofas. Clubbing doesn't get much easier than this. Upon those chairs
are the usual club goers, taking a small break from the hectic dance scene
on the dancefloor. And by looking at the empty glasses, this small break
has probably lasted alot longer than it should have. They're all pretty
out of it, but becareful, booze makes people do the strangest things.

Looking over the dancefloor~
    Just overlooking this dancefloor makes you tired. Those people are
just working up a sweat, movin' their bodies like that. On this side of 
the railing, however, things are alot more comfortable. People are here, 
having a few drinks, talking and socializing. It seems like they're having
a pretty cool time, just chillin' out like this. Although they seem pretty
content just sitting there, enjoying themselves, their empty glasses seem
less likely to do so. Hey, and what's this? How'd one of these guys get a 
crowbar this far into the club without being caught. Now that's scary.

Looking over the dancefloor~
     Although a little farther away, this part of the lounge still offers
an excellent view of the dancefloor, albeit a little more obstructed in
comparision. Much like the other tables near the edge of the dancefloor,
the tables are littered with empty drink glasses and mellow clubbers. Even
though the view isn't as nice, it's still pretty crowded. You try to 
navigate your way around these tables, disturbing as few people as possible.
However, the more you walked, the more annoyed these people seem to get.
Regardless, it seems they're not gonna let you get by without a little
fight.

About the VIP Lounge~
     Broken glass after broken glass! It's going to be interesting to see
how this place stays in business without any glasses to serve drinks in.
But hey, it's not your fault, they attacted first. Regardless, that's all
history now, since before you lies a few other glasses, waiting for you.
If you hurry past these few glasses, maybe you can check out what's all 
the action happening north of here, at the VIP table.

In front of the bar~
    Even though it's a little less crowded, these people seem as determined
as the rest of the lounge to get their drinks. Alteast waiting in line
here is alot more civil than the other bars. Hey, enjoy the good life 
while you can! It's not every day you get into the VIP lounge. Every
minute of this pampering in this luxurious lounge is very enjoyable. 
Anyways, the selection here is so good, it's a chore to decide what to 
start off with. Hmmm.. maybe if you get a little closer to the bar, the
decision won't be so hard to make. Now.. to get a little closer...

Before the VIP table~
    Boy, doesn't she act like shes God's gift! Sitting around on a leather
couch, she's surrounded by empty glasses and sex craved men. She's very
beautiful, and she knows it. I bet she's just teasing these guys, taunting
them with what they can't have. And the clothes that she wears: low cut,
skin tight and really short. If she shows more skin, she'd be naked. She
notices you walk up to the table and gives an unapproved smirk. She obviously
thinks that you're not worth her time. What a snobby bitch! She continues
to talk to her "boyfriends" even knowing you're standing before her. And 
what's this?! Everything's jumping to her defence at the slightest of words.
I think she needs a little humbling and you're just the ones to do it.

At the bar entrance~
    You find yourselves infront of the server entrance of the bar. People,
mainly shooter-girls, can be seen coming and going, getting their drinks 
and then leaving to serve them. Wouldn't be interesting if you could 
somehow just slip through this entrance and get behind the bar. Now that'd 
be cool. Think of all the free booze! But how can you get behind the 
bar without the proper key. Heck, only the shooter girls have the keys
to this place. Hmmmm.. shooter girl?

Behind the bar~
    Now that you're actually behind the bar, it's time for the party to
begin! Just soth of here lies endless shelves of booze, just waiting for
you. Some people have only dreamed about this.. now you're living that
dream. However, with all this booze lying around, it's going to be pretty
heavily guarded, bartenders everywhere. Heck.. there's a couple right here.
They don't seem impressed that you're here, where you're not supposed to
be. You better get ready, cause I think they're going to try to kick you
out.

Behind the bar~
    Now this is what I call heaven! Shelves of all the good stuff in almost
endless supplies. Bottle after bottle, just all waiting for you. You 
could spend the rest of your life here, drinking yourself silly. The 
greatest thing about it is that it's all free!! Enjoy it while you can.
You're living the dream others can only wish and hope for. Reality, however,
isn't that nice, since there are several "not so friendly" bartenders
making sure you remember what's a dream and what isn't. And from the
looks of things, they wanna wake you up and wake you up soon!

Behind the bar~
     This must be a dream! Row after row and shelf after shelf.. it just
doesn't get any better than this. Regardless, you're not going to have 
much time to enjoy this with these bartenders watching your every move.
I'd watch it, since they don't like the friendly type. They obviously know
something's wrong since you're here. Considering the way they're reaching
for things that obviously can be used as weapons, I think they're going
to correct what's wrong.

Behind the bar~
    And the dream continues. You stand before what seems to be an endless
supply of beer and booze. Shelves and shelves of it, just waiting to be
consumed. However, much like the other parts of the bar, these bartenders
don't seem to like the idea of you standing here. They're having a rough
night already, serving these people, so they're pretty cranky. They turn 
to you and stare at your with evil eyes. You mention you just got lost
trying to find the bathroom, but I guess they're not buying it. You'll 
just have to fight them off I guess.

Before the till~
    Wow, behind the bar and infront of the cash registar too! Tell me this
ain't an ideal dream or what! All the free booze you want and now you're
gonna get rich off it too! You better hurry up though.. once security
finds out your behind ya, they'll be swarming the bar looking for ya. Don't
matter much though.. you're almost done sampling thier fine selection of
liquirs and spirts. Now all ya gotta do is get this darned till open and
then you can split.

In the back office~
    This is ssssoooooo uncool! How can a happening place like this have
such a crappy office like this?! I guess they really put all their efforts
into the club itself and not the back room. Papers are all over the place
and a small desk lies in one corner, gather bills and dust. You work so
hard to get into this place and all you get is this!? What a rip! The only thing
that's half interesting is the backdoor, lockated just east of here. Well,
atleast you don't have to go through the usual crowds leaving the joint!

Through the back door~
    The pounding of the bass and the screams of partiers will be heard
for miles, you imagine. However, your ears won't probably hear much for
the next few hours. All that loud music and screaming has left your ears
ringing pretty nicely and your throat pretty raw. You notice on the ground
an under age ID bracelet that the club gives out on its all ages nights!
I guess you're not the first ones to exit that establishment through the
back door.

{M,BOLD}Portia's Palace of EROTIC Pleasure{m}~
You walk into a room that looks remarkably like your most erotic dream.. no, your most
erotic fantasy. You feel parts of yourself tingle as you notice the assortment of toys
and sexual aids lying scattered about. A loud moan of pleasure emminates from a nearby
shadowy corner, followed by the continue squeeks of an old bed.. a sound you recognize
for too easily coming from this room. You tune in and can easily hear Portia's sultry
voice moan.. as clear as a summer's day.. but the male's voice is somewhat distorted and
garbled. Doesn't matter, since it's probably just another one of Portia's men. You 
decide to take a couple firm back.. even this may be too much for you to handle.
