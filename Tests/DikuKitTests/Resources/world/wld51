{R}The Entrance to the {R}{BOLD}City of Drow{r}~


 {Y} You are at the entrance to a small underground city.  A great
  adamantite gate lies closed to the west.  You see two small watch
  towers in the distance along with slow-moving pacing forms.  Heavy
  carts and wagons are being pulled and dragged every which way by 
  goblins which make your movement somewhat difficult.  A rather large
  well-built Drow stands directly in the center of the Main Gate.  He
  seems to be checking all incoming and exporting goods from the 
  city.  A faint rancid smell can be caught by the upward wind, along
  with distant screams and howls of agony. {y}

{R}The East Gate of the {BOLD}{R}City of Drow{r}{bold}~


  {Y}You step through the large adamantite gates to give yourself a
  somewhat clearer view of the vibrant city of Drow.  Various shops 
  are present further into the city as you pass through the busy 
  streets.  People of all size, stature, race and color seem to
  take no notice as you are shoved carelessly into a wall.  A small
  green man runs up to you and tugs on your shirt, asking for a 
  small patronage, only to be dragged away by its master and 
  beaten.{y}

Executioners Lane~
    You walk along a highly ornate street going north and south.
Various rubble is strewn along the street that seems to have been discarded
without caring.  Various bums and homeless people of all ages line
the sides of the street, each having a small tray in which to place
any donations.  While passing by, you notice a small child that looks just
like you when you were a child.  You stop in your tracks, in the middle of
a pushy crowd, and gawk at this sight.  You have a flashback of your youth,
and how it would have been if you had lived like this.  You decide to
take pity on the child and sit by it.  The child is pale and dirty and
shows lack of nourishment.  He politely asks you to put some gold ( 10 gold )
in his tray, so that he may eat a hardy meal for once.

Intersection of Executioners Lane and Torture Street~
  Okay, you've seen some dirty streets back there but this has to be the
worst.  Everywhere you step seems to be trash.  You shake your head at the
sight of so much filth, and the fact that roaches and mice are crawling
around your feet doesn't help any.  While kicking at the trash around you,
a piece of trash makes a noise.. "Ow!," The trash says.  You have seen some
odd things in your time, but this has to be the oddest.. talking trash ?
The trash rolls about the ground until finally it stands up to reveal a
filthy, short green goblin.  He demands the reason for you kicking him, and
you profusely apologize.  He nods and questions as to why you are here.
You go on to tell him that you are exploring, in which he nods, and asks
if you will help him and his race fight the Drow.  He states his name is
Vuga and will gladly accept any assistance to fight for him and his race.
You shrug helplessly, will you 'help vuga' ?

friend Vuga you have been watching where you step, making sure not to
step on any other goblins who might not be as nice.  The road extends to
the west and east and a small adobe can be seen to the north.

at them.  You walk towards them and all they do is cringe and shake more.

  This house is extremely small and cozy, except for the trash. ( of course )
The clearing of this house is so low, you had to duck when you walked in.
There seems to be a small family a few yard away eating dinner.  You try
not to be intruding and make a slight knocking noise on the nearest item.
The family immediately turns to you and shrieks.  They left up their dinner
table and try to cower behind it to defend themselves.  You try to explain
that you mean no harm but it seems unlike Vuga, they cannot speak your
tongue.

Why are they so afraid ?

of all sorts are crawling here, feasting on the remains of various
edible objects.  Surrounding you as you enter the room are scrawny
malnutritioned goblins.  They seem to have all spotted you and are
walking like living zombies toward you.  You attempt to back up
but are surrounded.  One of them got close to you and managed to
slip his hand into your pouch and steal a few coins.  With the 
attempt to steal your gold, you have had it. You draw your weapon
and prepare to fight these helpless victims.  With weapon high the
goblins seem to get frightened and cringe in terror.  You hope they
wont try any sort of thievery attempt again, but you doubt it.

You are standing before the edge of a cliff that appears to be

around it.  While peering down into the vast bottomless pit you
notice in the corner of your eye a large bunch of furry animals
that resemble hamsters.  The only difference is these animals have
blue fur and green hair! There must be at least twenty of them!
They appear to all be getting into line formation and are running
their furry bodies one by one off the cliff.  You ponder as to
why these cute little fuzzy guys are so suicidal.

Intersection between Executioners Lane and Trinidad Avenue~
   This is another crowded intersection, with the normal pushing and shoving
that you have learned to get used to.  While pushing forward, you peek up
above the crowd and notice a large brigade of elite drowish troops pushing
people away from a large moveable throne.  You scratch your head, wondering
if it really _is_ a throne.  Upon closer examination, you notice the throne,
has a very evil-looking king upon it.  He motions to his guards to set his 
throne down and step aside.  He takes a light step off the throne, brushes
himself off and clears his throat.  
Do you want to 'listen' to the 'king' speak ?

a gold embroidered overcoat and is wearing a diamond-studded tophat.  He
seems to take notice of you, nor of anything, for that matter,  His nose
is in the air and he glides down the street with ease.  While walking however,
he briefly looks down to notice that his boots have a smudge of dirt on them.
He shakes his head and ducks out of the crowd and into an alley. You wonder
if maybe you should deprive this man of his clothing and gold.. 
Now's your chance, he's not looking! Quicky.. !

screaming at everyone, blaming anyone who will listen.  Some teenagers
of the Goblin race come charging at the screaming Drow, knocking him
down, causing a wrestling match.  The teenagers succesfully rob the
remains of the Drow-merchant and flee the scene before guards could
arrive.

heads in your general direction and proceed to the building to the south.

down the street you look at the sky, and are shocked to see bluish-greyish
masses conglomorate into a devastatingly poweful cloud.  You can make out
electrical currents that are flowing in and around this cloud.  As you
try to continue to watch your extraterrestrial event take place, a hefty 
man gives you a powerful nudge, which causes you to fly into nearby barrel.
You stand-up, brush yourself off and curse at the man.  Instantly you watch 
as a huge purple bolt incinerates the man where he stood.  You stand there
in awe, mouth open, wondering.. What is that cloud ?

above the building to the north.  To the north you here various battle and
war cries.  Both buildings are decoratively embroidered with purple-adamantite
letters that describe their reasons for being built.  You step up to the 
northern building and read "Mage Hall of Training".  Nodding to youself,
you take a step back and go to the southern end of the street and read
"Warrior Hall Of Training".  You cautiously think about the dangers of
walking ito a _drow_ training hall.  Decide wisesly my friend..

flows pleasantly in the center of the yard.  The two Guardsman 
in the room seem to have temporarily left, leaving you with the pleasure
of tasting this delicious water.  As you near the fountain, a small
button appears to be pressable on the bottom of the fountain.  You 
curiously press the button which instantly explodes a large vibrant
portal.. To where? No clue.. Hmm..

At the far northern end of the room is a rather fat man who is
cackling loudly over a bellydancer who slipped on a banana peel.
Throughout the commotion however, you fail to notice the throne
guards sneaking behind you.  In an instant the room becomes quiet
as you quickly unsheathe your swords.  You find it odd that the King
is still laughing..

Above The Sacrifical Pit~
  You are standing below a freshly bloodstained pit.  Engraved on
the top of the pit is a picture of a giant spider with a human head.
Looking down the pit you seem to notice nothing but an endless void.
Looking to the north, the King is still cackling away.  The man is
still drinking and feeding his face while pointing at you and
laughing.  Isn't odd how he is about to die and could care less?
Hmm.. oh well.. heh

  You have found the infamous Treasure Chamber of the Drow palace.
Several items are strewn about on the floor waiting to be picked
up.  The room is lavishly decorated with ancient pictures and
murals of past Kings and leaders.  You greedily take the items,
wiggle your litle buttom and pat yourself on the back.

Weaponsmaster's Chamber~
  You are in a room in which an assortment of weapons hangs from
each of the walls.  The owner of the weapons seems to take much 
pride in his weapons as he paces about cleaning them and sharpening
those that need sharpening.  A few local guards off duty appear
to be in the room chatting with the smith as he completes his
daily cleaning.  In the midst of a conversation one of the guards
notices you and unsheathes his sword.  The smith ironically shrieks
in utter terror and huddles beneath the counter.  The guards snicker
at each other as they glance at the smith then instantly charge
you.

barracks so close to the gate of the city to enable themselves
to defend their city quicker in case of an invasion.  Various swords
and weapons hang on the walls, ready to be used at any given time.
You notice a small man holding a pair of binoculars in the room

up a nearby glass of water and takes a sip, still looking into
the binoculars.  The room has nothing in it but a chair that
lies by the window.  You would assume it is there to help the

goblin slaves that appear to be pulling the wagon that he is in.  The 
goblins appear to be nearly dead as the so-called Drow Master furiously
whips the life out of the innocen and helpless.  You wish there was something
you could do, something you could say to _help_ the goblins.

The Shop of the Drow Armourer~
An average-sized Drow with an emotionless face is sitting on an
oak chair, with his legs kick backed.  He is reading the newspaper and
seems to take absolutely no interest in you whatsoever.  You calmnly
yet firmly walk up the desk where he sits and ring the bell.  The
Armourer does nothing but itch his nose and make a slight cough.
You are quite distubed at this and begin to furiously ring the bell,
hoping that he will help you.  The Armourer stands up, walks around his
desk, unsheathes his sword, takes a fighting stance, and
says, "I'll show you what happened to the last person who interrupted me
while reading the comics!" and charges you.

The Shop of the Drow Weaponsmith~
As you enter the room, a large argument breaks out between the weaponsmith
and a customer.  You try to eavesdrop a bit while scanning the large array
of drowish weapons that have been displayed.  It seems that the customer had
bought a weapon that he claims has no magical value and demands his money
back.  You curiously wonder what magical item this individual is talking 
about, but you are a bit too far away to get a good hear, and inch a little
forward.  The weaponsmith turns his head and notices you and completely
ignores the other customer, and asks you if there is anything he can do.
You nod in your head, and tell him you are looking for a good sword, and would
be willing to pay well for one.  He shows you an assortment of swords and 
blades but none seem to take your interest.  He then continues to show you
his other wares, but still nothing satisfies yo, until he comes across
a unique pair of boots.. Should you "buy" the boots for 20 mil ?

Various mechants, peddlers, beggars and thieves are all joined
and condensed in this intersection.  Loud shouts and arguments
can be heard and seen from every which way.  Guardsman seem
to attempt to watch the crowd and prevent as much crime and
disturbances as possible.

To the North lies the Palace of King Dai'Shan.

To the South lies the Slave City of the Goblins.

To the West and East lies the Dark Wilderness.

Western Center Avenue~
You are pushed and shoved every which way by the massive crowd.  Maneuvering
through this is extremely difficult.  You manage to get to a part of the
street that is a little less crowded and give a sigh of relief.  You wipe the
swear from your brow and gain your posture.  You bend over to brush your pants
off and notice in the corner of your eye a woman being robbed.  You take a quick
moment to decide on what you should do, either let her be, and avoid danger,
or help an innocent woman.  You go with your conscious and decide to help the
woman out.  You run towards the thugs and draw your weapon.  Upon seeing you,
they immediately shriek in terror and drop the lady and her possessions and
flee the scene.  The lady gains her posture and thanks you heartily.  She tells
you of a red dragon that can be found to the south that has great treasure.
You thank the lady for the information and politely escort her to her house.

The Drow Wizard's Shop~
A fairly plain-looking room with nothing in it but a small globe sitting
on a pedestal in the center.  You curiously look at the globe, and notice
nothing amazing about it.  While looking, a small, old drowish man walks in
from the backroom and greets you happily.  The man pulls up his multi-colored
pants and walks up to you and the globe.  "You like the globe, yes?," he says.
You nod your head, still completely confused as to what its purpose could be.
"This here globe will tell ya something that will most likely aid you in your
journeys.  I can't tell ya what because it varies on the person.
"During my younger years, while adventuring, I found this in Dargamoth Castle
under a bed.  I brought it back to my house and studied it.  After years of
fiddling with it, it shocked me as to how its powers worked. While cleaning
one Spring morning like this, it started to glow.  You try.. "rub" it like so.

A strong stench fills your nostrils as you enter the room.  You gag as
you proceed to the desk in which a small little girl is happily mixing
various colored potions together.  You notice one of the beakers is starting
to vigurously shake until it shatters.  The little girl screams and ducks
under the desk.  A moment later two older drow step in from the back and
peer around and sigh.  Realizing the young girl must be their daughter,
you wonder if now would be the right time to ask the merchant about his
wares.  While putting all his effort into cleaning, he looks up and notices
you.  He politely asks you what he can do and you tell him you are looking
for a good potion.  He motions his wife to bring an odd-colored beaker to
him.  He takes the beaker and explains that this potion is mystical.
It has the power to protect you from enemies before and during battle.
You gasp in astonishment and ask the man his price... 250k he says.

Inside the Western Gate of the City of Drow~
  A lone drow guardsman stands here.  As you approach him, he proceeds to
explain that the wilderness to the west has not yet been created by the
almighty God Zoharn but will soon exist.  He goes into detail about the many
powerful items and monsters that have been rumored to soon exist in this
wilderness.  Obviously this guardsman isn't the brightest.  First, he isnt
supposed to be speaking with anyone but his comrades or of the Drow race. 
Second, he shouldnt be revealing such confidential information.  No matter,
you think.  He seems harmless enough.  You thank the drow for his time and
proceed back to the east.

You approach the gates and ask them to let you pass, but get nothing but
a snicker and a chuckle from one of them.  You reach for your money pouch
and show it to one of them who starts to chuckle even louder.  Obviously,
these men are dedicated to their King.  You notice a small slot in which
could fit a piece of paper adjacent to the door.  You wonder what paper 
, parchment or scroll is to be placed there.

for the occasional begger or merchant who brings wares to the
palace nobles. Although somewhat afraid of what lies ahead, you

appears to have the movements of a master.  The small double-bladed
twisted dagger to his side indicates a man that you probably do
not want to mess with.  Beyond the figure lies a small slot in which
a card is placed.

man stand out from the rest.  Clad in pitch-black armor he seems to fight
with undeniable passion.  You start to move toward the soldier, hoping
he will have some useful information.  While moving closer, you overhear him
say, "Thats it! Good work! Think of them as humans, dwarves, giants, elfs
or those puny halflings!".  You take a gulp and start to step backwards 
when you realize it is too late, he notices you.  "Ahh! Good! Better practice!

  Sparks of electricity fly about the room, bouncing everywhere.  A pure
white bolt of mana is released from one apprentices hand and flies directly
in your direction.  Frozen with fear, you manage to raise your shield in
defense.  You wince and duck, hoping this bolt of magic will not harm you.
Moments later you hear cackling and laughing in the distance.  A powerful
Arch-Wizard wielding a long-white staff is standing in front of you.  He 
helps you up and explains that the bolt was nothing more than an illusion.
You brush yourself off and go on to tell him you saw a cloud of electrical
currents hovering above the building.  The Mage nods and states that when
mass amounts of mana are used in this area, it forms into a cloud, not a
regular cloud though. More like a being, when created, it will either help
you or hurt you.  Watch out for that lightning in various places..

cross in the hands of one of the priests that seems to be in a deep
trance.  You lick your mouth and smile, knowing that it has to have some
decent value to it.  You stealthily sneak up to the robed figure and
reach for the cross when the priest jumps up and shouts, "Ala Viern Dierce!"
and you begin to shake and shiver.  He then speaks in a very calm voice
the words, "You seek this?", and points to his cross.  "Let's see you 
attempt, little man." the cleric mutters.  He motions the clerics to stand

leathery armor.  As you examine the pupils, a figure grabs you from behind
and enfolds his arm around your neck, and positions the point of his
dagger into your back.  You gulp and frantically attempt to explain that
you were just observing.  The man utters in a low, calm, monotone voice
the word, "Rasa Ia Adib" and inserts his dagger into your back..

the direction, that this figure is watching you.  You cant possibly
think of the reason for this figure and persist to move to the adjacent
room.  As you begin to move, you feel a slight push and notice your
legs have been swiped from beneath you and you are flat on the
ground.  The huge figure in the center of the room seems to have
slipped behind you and tripped you.  You demand the reason for such a
foul deed.  The figure tells you that you must be of the Drow race
to enter the shops, and no other.  Although, while he talks he
seems to take a large interest in your gold pouch.  At the end of the
conversation, the so-called body-guard, coughs very low, and you can
make the faint sound of the word five-million leave his mouth.

A Goblin Meeting House~
You have come to a rather small room in which several Goblins stand
guard.  They watch your every move and seem ready for combat at
any moment.  To the north-eastern part of the room lies a spiral
staircase that continues upwards.

Second Level Of The Goblin Meeting House~
The room is of average size but the amazing amount of furniture
and statues makes the room cluttered.  Standing by an oak table
stands three men.  One of the men is extremely large and seems
to be staring at a piece of paper on the table while the other
two men just nod and smirk at each other.  As you walk up the 
stairs, however, the man jump back and within a flash of an 
instant one of them is behind you.  You are trapped! Ironically,
the large men is still in deep concentration over the piece of
paper on the table.

The Hidden Cellar~
A dusty old cellar with cobwebs and insects.  It appears to be
an old cellar that was once used to hide themselves from the
Drow during invasions.

Blackadder Lane~
You have come to a cleaner part of the street in which the dirt
and rubble has been pushed aside.  To the south lies a somewhat
run down building in which several well-fed Goblins are standing
guard.  To the west lies a house which looks old and beaten down.
To the east the road continues to a large Central Dump site.

A Museum~
A completely empy room with nothing but a single painting at
the far end of the room.  The room is amazingly clean and shows
no sign of wear or tear.  The walls are all white and it seems they
have been recently painted.. by who? Good question..

The Entrance to the Goblin Kings House~
You stand before a house that seems to be hidden amongst a huge
pile of trash.   There must be something or someone of importance
in that pile of trash or else there wouldn't be these huge burly
guards here to defend it.  Soon after you near the house a large
pile of trash falls behind you blocking your way back.  You
realize that your only choice is to either kindly ask these guys
to let you pass or fight them.  Well, since you cant talk to them
to convince them because I dont feel like waiting twenty years for
a comm to input a specproc your just going to have to fight 
them. :)

Outside the Goblin Kings Bedroom~
You have defeated the four guards in the previous room and strut
your way into this room only to notice another guard.  This guard
is, however, different.  He sees you walk into the room and does
nothing more than give a smirk and chuckle.  As you draw your 
weapon the soldier does nothing but laugh harder.  After several
minutes of watching him continue to belittle you he unsheathes his
long black sword, cracks his neck, and exclaims, "Now, Let's Dance!"
The soldier charges at you...

The Goblin King's Bedroom~
You have finally made it to the Kings Bedroom.  He is sitting here
on his bed staring at the floor and shaking his head.  Upon your
entrance he jumps out and screams, "Ack! Guards! HELP!".  You 
give a loud cackle and ready yourself to have the poor King
meet his maker.  In a flash of a second the King is on the opposite
side of the room in which he presses a dark blue button.  The
door behind you fades away while the walls to the left and right
of you become transparent.  You shrug helplessly and charge the
King.

The Bad Part Of Gravity~
As you can now see this room is a complete mirage.  The DT was 
nothing more than a mob.  I wouldn't suggest telling anyone about
this little mirage, though.  All in all this room gives the image
that you are standing in between two cliffs which is actually
quite frightening.

Other Side Of The Cliff~
You have reached the other side of the cliff.  It has beautiful
scenery that expands all the way up to the top.  Red roses and 
an assortment of trees and bushes pop up all around.  While
taking in the amazingly beautiful scenery you notice a small 
lizard zip by your feet.  You shake your head in disbelief..
Then.. All at once, another lizard-shaped figure nears you,
except this time even closer.  The lizard-like beings slowly
near you and circle you as if circling a prey.  You shake and 
shudder, hoping they arent hostile.  One of the snaps at your
ankle but you miraculously leap away and unsheathe your weapon.

Climbing the Mountain~
As you climb this mountain you realize the heat is really starting
to get to you. Sweat seems to be drenching your body and making
visibility hard.  You notice a massive figure that must be at least
fourteen or fifteen feet tall standing before you wielding a huge
spiked club.  He seems to take no notice of you yet but once he
does, I would ran away as fast as possible.

Entrance to the Dragons Lair~
You have come before a large cave that stinks of burning flesh.
A growl can be heard from within and your attempts to peek inside
reveal nothing but a few decomposing corpses.  A warm wind is 
slowly blowing out from within the cave making you as fearful
as ever.  You gather your wits and courage and prepare to enter
the dangerous cave.

Entrance to the Dragons Lair~
As you enter the cave the amount of decayed corpses and distorted
bodies increases more and more.   You gasp and shake your head in
despair, deeply pondering as to who or what could have done such
a massacre.  The lifeless bodies were seem to have burned alive 
and had no chance of survival.  Searching of the vicinity shows
that there is a small feather in one of the corpses that looks
fairly unique from any other kind.  You push your fears aside and
press onward.

A Pool of Radiance~
You have arrived in the lair of the King of the Dragons.  The
lair has a huge pool of translucent water in the center.  It seems
the King is asleep right now and has been for quite a while.  
According to ancient stories the Kings wife was killed by a 
warring raid of Orcs.  Since the occurence the King has been 
asleep in his cave.  The estimated size of this beast must be 
at least fourty feet tall and at least 30 feet long.  You definetly
do not want to wake up this monster without preparing for the
consequences.
