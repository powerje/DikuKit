Deep in the bamboo forest~
  {GREEN} ][, ,{green}     The sound of a hundred hushed whispers haunt this
{GREEN}  '][ /`{green}     forest with every passing breeze. The weather
{GREEN}   ][/  {green}     remains cool and comfortable during your travels
{GREEN}  `][,  ][,{green}  through this new land, yet the sound of the same
{GREEN}  ,]['  ][`{green}  comforting breeze almost deafens you with each
{GREEN} '\][  `][ ,{green} passing through this grove of bamboo. It's a perfect
{GREEN}   ][,  ][/'{green} balance peace and chaos. The forest remains void of
{GREEN}   ][  `][{green}   all forms of life, other than yourself. Yet, this
{GREEN} , ][`  ][,{green}  errie lifeless forest does give you an increadible
{GREEN}`\ ][ , ][`{green}  sence of peacefulness and serenity. You continue
{GREEN} `\][/` ][/`{green} your travels through this thick grove of bamboo,
{GREEN}   ][   ][ {green}  searching for any sign of life.

{G}  `][,      ][, {W} off the main path. This offbeat path, which veers 
{G}  ,]['      ][` {W} to the east, meanders through some of the deepest,
{G} '\][      `][, {W} darkest and thickest parts of the bamboo forest. It
{G}   ][,      ][, {W} draws you forward, your curiosity now peeked, as 
{G}`\ ][ ,     ][` {W} questions of what is at the end of the path begin
{G} `\][/`     ][/`{W} dance in your mind.  You journey forward, but

Deep in the bamboo forest~
{G}   ][, ,    {W} Your journey along the beaten path continues, but this
{G}  '][ /`    {W} time,  it presents a unique choice.  Here,  the path 
{G}   ][/      {W} splits into two, one heavily travelled path headed to
{G}  `][,  ][, {W} the north and another, less travelled one pointing to
{G}  ,]['  ][` {W} the west.  The forest, however, continues it's errire
{G} '\][  `][ ,{W} silence even though the forest grows thicker and 
{G}   ][,  ][/'{W} thicker with each step.  Life,  which would seemingly
{G}   ][  `][  {W} thrive in this part of the forest,  seems to be 
{G} , ][`  ][, {W} strangely absent.  You begin to wonder, but refocus
{G}`\ ][ , ][` {W} on your goal and the decision at hand.  What secrets
{G} `\][/` ][/`{W} can this forest be hiding? Perhaps the answer lies at
{G}   ][   ][  {W} the end of these paths, or even in the forest itself.
