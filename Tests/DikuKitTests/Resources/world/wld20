{BO,RE}Chamber of {bo,re}{RE}Assassins{re}~

   {RE}You step into a ceremonial chamber where the {BO,RE}Assassins{bo,re}{RE} meet to discuss
   the most brutal and devious plans of murder.  There are rich velvet
   curtains strewn to cover up the barred windows, hardly something as
   comforting as you'd like.  The stone floor is stained with patches of
   {BO,RE}blood{bo,re}{RE}, although there have been attempts to wash it away.  Even at their
   most calm gatherings, people are {BO,RE}slaughtered{bo,re}{RE}!{re}

 {RE}  You walk into a small office where there the editors, stenographers,
   photographers, and writers for the famous Northern Crossroads Idea Center
   do their work.  A cute secretary walks up to the counter as you approach
   and tells you "On this board is a few ideas.  If you want to submit an
   idea to the editors for review, just post it on the board over here
   okay?"  She then sits back and continues her work.{re}

   This is the most beautiful room you have ever stepped foot in. You can
   watch over the entire town of Midgaard from here with out even moving a
   muscle. In the middle of the room lies a huge desk. Unlike the endless
   stacks of uncompleted work resting upon the GODS desk, the stack resting
   on this desk is smaller then usual, meaning someone has been doing their
   job. In the northeast corner of the room rests a printer, which is used
   to hardcopy all the pages of code, the High Gods produce.
   
   A ton of little yellow sticky notes can be seen stuck about the room with 
   reminders of what needs to get done.

The Room of Appointment~
You are surrounded by the opulent benefits of immortality.  Sleek
furnishings decorate the room and lend an air of dignified grand and style.
Illumination from an enormous skylight in the vaulted ceiling falls upon
white marble busts of the mighty beings known collectively as the Gods.
Inlaid into the floor is an incredibly detailed map of the world.  Peering
closer, you are stunned to see movement across the expanse of what you
once thought to be a mere map.  You realize that before you lies the entire
realm in miniature with all the hopes and fears of its denizens contained
within. Awestruck, you stand back and reflect upon the true meaning of the
words duty, responsibility, judgement, power, and the appointment of God.

You humbly approach the altar towards the board to write your name to
nominate yourself for the position of a God.

Encino's small, little Private Chamber :)~
     You see a giant hall filled with all kind of memories, the owner has
collected in his long-lasting life. You see lots of ancient weapons which
have crossed his way a long time ago, shelves of old, dusty books which
he may have read once centuries ago, chests of all sizes and contends that
are opened and unopened. In the distance you notice an incredible ugly
stone statue that is merely covered by a half-rotten carpet.  You can feel
the long past and forgotten ages, which are still memories here.  On a huge
desk in the front you notice a computer, a diary and a folder what apparently
have been in use currently.

aggressive~
                        Aggressive... how it works
 
this is how it works with prot from evil:
 
If a mob has anti-rune, it attacks anyway
otherwise, if you have prot from evil, and the mob is evil, and you are
less evil than the mob, it WON'T attack you, otherwise, it will.
 
please test this.

  {BO,RE}You are standing inside a very dark smithy. You notice the absense of
  windows, only the red light of the {YEL}fireplace{BO,RE} lightens the room. A lot of
  useless broken weapons and pieces of armour are lying around, making
  it difficult to cross the room. There is a sign up by the entrance door.{bo,re}

{R}IN THE JAIL{r}~

You are now trapped in a dingy-looking jail.  A stern
looking bailiff stands at one corner, staring balefully
at you, expecting no nonsense.  He doesn't look like a
guy to mess with.  

YOU ARE TRAPPED HERE UNTIL YOU CAN TALK TO A GOD.

{RE}
   You step into a clean, but chilly shop with a glass display
   case where many different types of select meats are piled.
   An odor wafts toward you, reminding you of the farm - both
   the kitchen and the barn!  The staff may not be the most
   pleasant, but the product is excellent - and fresh!

Ruinan's Super Hideout!~
   You stare around in this room.  It's pretty dark, and there is a large
control panel set in the middle of the floor with a kazillion switches and
buttons on it.  Curious, you press a button, and to your astonishment, the
far wall rumbles slowly upwards to reveal a thousand television screens
behind!  Each screen shows each player and their actions!  At first you are
disgusted with this blantant violation of privacy but then become intrigued
as you watch some of the players secretly scratching themselves, others 
picking their nose while pretending not to, and others performing even
more bizarre acts that they'd die if anyone else even knew their secrets.
You wonder if Ruinan must have a blackmail racket going on.... and you wonder
what he knows about YOU!

   {RE}COMMITTEE {re}{YEL}member of our {BO,RE}Northern Crossroads{bo,re}{YEL}
   community.  It is a gravel road which leads all
   the way to the city dump.  you walk up to one of 
   the mounted plaques along side of the road and
   read it: "Here lies the remains of the statue
   that was once dedicated to{BO,YEL} Zapper{bo,yel}{YEL}.  It was
   demolished during a citizen riot during his reign
   and turned into the gravel that is now underfoot."
   Unluckily, {BO,YEL}Zapper{bo,yel}{YEL} escaped and exiled himself to
   become a graduated Computer Engineer.{yel}

   This western part of the Common Square gives
   access to a small alley a bit further to the
   west. The raucous sounds of bar music can be
   heard coming from that direction. The local
   healer can be found mixing some potions
   to the south.

{BO,YEL}Remembrance of {BO,CY}Nixdorf{bo,cy}~
{BO,YEL}
   You are in a large open area with a large
   rock pedestal in the middle. On the pedestal,
   you see a dozen bronze waffles.  Beside it, 
   you see a sign with the following inscription:
   "Here lies Nixdorf's last breakfast before he 
   was assassinated by the sponsors of Kellogg's 
   Pop Tarts." He is now a rich computer programmer
   working for the richer powers that be.  
{bo,yel}{YEL}   
   You grab the nearest waffle and pay your respects.

{YEL}Monument of {BO,YEL}Apolo{bo,yel}~
{BO,YEL} 
   There is a large stone statue of Apolo riding
   the back of a fierce dragon. In one hand, he
   holds a bright red juicy Apple, and in the 
   other he holds a huge paper bag filled with
   groceries.  Obviously he had just gone shopping
   for supplies. You have no idea where he is, but
   it is likely that he is working in Taiwan 
   making more money than you'll ever see.  You 
   bow your head and pay your respects to Apolo 
   the great Computer Engineer.

{CY}{BOL}West Side{cy}{bold}{CY} of{G}{BOLD} Market Square{g}~

  The west side of Market Square seems to be
  filled with shady looking characters. You
  can see stalls where they sell swords and 
  armaments. The crowds bustle, and heroes seem 
  to be pushing through the throngs everywhere
  you look. A bit further to the west the main 
  street continues, leading to the western city gates.

{M}The Creators' Room{m}~

You have entered a room where creation is the ultimate
goal. A huge skylight lets the bright blue sky penetrate
this incredible chamber and giving it the feeling of home
and inner-peace. A small tapestry is hung upon the northern
wall, depicting various stages of creation in our wonderful
land. At first, you don't notice it, but you notice a putrid
stench rising from a hole in the ground. To one corner of
the room you notice a small board, while exits lead in all
directions.
