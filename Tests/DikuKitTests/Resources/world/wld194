A Narrow Trench~
  It appears that you have stumbled upon a path leads away from the
putrid marsh.  The path, worn from centuries of use, stands before
you.  Along its edges can be seen small animals of various colours.  Oaks,
maples, and elms seem to make up this small enclave.  Further to the
east you see a small mound of earth rising to meet the sky.

Along the Trench~
  As you continue down the path you slowly start to notice a change
in the local vegetation.  Small bushes of various sizes now make up
the colourful landscape.  Overhead can be seen both birds of prey
and birds of fancy.  In all, this seems to be a somewhat peaceful land.
As you return to the path, you notice that the large mound of earth
you saw earlier is just over the horizon.

A Mound of Earth~
  It appears that you have finally reached the end of the path.  A large,
yet natural, mound of earth now stands before you.  Flowers of every
colour cover its sod exterior.   Hundreds of insects seem to dance with
delight as they go about gathering their precious nectar.

  To your dismay, a door appears to have been cut directly into the mound.
It's wooden frame shows signs of neglect, but other than than that, it
appears to be in good working order.

The Sod House~
  You appear to be standing in what seems to be a house.  Each wall
is blanketed with large oaken beams which support the enterior.  Debris
of all shapes and sizes has been scattered throughout the house.  Pieces
of moldy bread seem to have been discarded in haste - almost as if the
previous occupant didn't have time to collect his things before his
untimely departure.

  Towards the back of the house you see a small burrow.  From the looks
of things, this is a somewhat new addition to the house.

dark altar.

  The chant of, "Death from life.  Life from Death.  Take me.  Take me."

The Dream of Klennan~
  You stand within a long and winding tube of energy.  The walls, floor, and
ceiling are made of a pure and pulsating light.  A slow, and methodical, hum-
ming noise can be heard - making it almost impossible to concentrate.  You
only have one option - continue forward.

{BOLD,BLACK} The Smithy {bold,black}~
  You are standing in a small and very dark Smithy.  You notice the absence
of windows, and only the red light of the fireplace lightens the room.  Small
pieces of discarded armour and weapons have been thrown about the Smith.  The
only exit out of the Smithy seems to be a small walkway to the south.

  You seem to have entered a small room.  Along each wall stands a 
cabinet filled with all kinds of candy.  A small fountain, filled with
chocolate milk, has been placed directly in front of you.  A sweet song
of happiness is being pumped from four small speakers mounted in each
corner.

{WHITE}The {BOLD,GREEN}Break{bold,green} {BOLD,WHITE}Room{bold,white}~
  Four long tables have been placed strategically throughout the room.
A five-bladed ceiling fan slowly rotates above you, powered by the wind.
On the western wall a small sign reading, "This is an equal opportunity
employer", waves in the breeze.  Along the eastern wall rests on old,
weather beaten{BOLD,BLINK,GREEN} Jolt Vending Machine{bold,blink,green}.

{BOLD,MAGENTA}Queen Anne's Pastry Shop{bold,magenta}~
{BOLD,MAGENTA}
   Pies, tiny pastries, tarts and cakes lay cooling on the shop's
   counter, their aromas filling your nostrils. Your hungry belly
   yearns for something sweet, and filling. Queen Anne seems to
   have enjoyed a tart or two herself. The rotund woman approaches
   the counter, awaiting your purchase.

Towards the Dream~
  You stand in an old and musty chamber.  Constructed out of marble, large
one-foot by three-foot blocks make up the floor and the walls.  Above you
stands a ceiling wooden beams and plaster tiles.  A large eating table,
measuring twelve-feet by five-feet rests along the northern wall.  A small
{BOLD,YELLOW}T{G}a{Y}p{G}e{Y}s{G}t{Y}r{G}y{white} hangs above you.
