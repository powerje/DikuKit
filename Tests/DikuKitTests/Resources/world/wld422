{Y}  As the wisps part, the path appears briefly but always seeming
{Y}  in a different direction.  Nothing is stable yet the mist is
{Y}  constant.  A pungent odor, like that of death itself, assails
{Y}  your nostrils.  There is no alternative but to plunge ahead.

{Y}  The mists swirl, sometimes obscuring your vision completely, 
{Y}  at other times clearing enough that you think you see the path.
{Y}  Reality fades as the cold damp mist permeates your very being.
{Y}  As the wisps part, the path appears briefly but always seeming
{Y}  in a different direction.  Nothing is stable yet the mist is
{Y}  constant.  A pungent odor, like that of death itself, assails
{Y}  your nostrils.  There is no alternative but to plunge ahead.

Endless Maze~
 
  Sliding down you can almost feel eternity passing you by
  and tugging at the strings of your sanity.  Perhaps the
  phrase slipping into insanity is more accurate than any
  has given credit for.
