The hills~

  You are on a worn dirt path leading north, small hills surrond
you. As you approach the mountains to your north you sense an air
of evil, and the sky itself seems to darken.

The hills~

 You have continued north on the worn dirt path. The sky seems
even darker here and the hills loom ominous all about you. All
around you are threatening hill and you feel eyes upon you as 
you walk. To your east the path continues and the sound of evil 
laughter draws you. Its time to chose your path, choose carefully.

End of the path~

  The path stops here, before you is an incredibly large mountain.
The evil eminating from it shakes you to your very soul. To your 
north appears a dark and frightening cave opening. The lure of the
unknown compells you to venture forth and explore. On the side of
the path is a sign worn and covered by debris.

flowing from west to east to a waterfall. To the north you can see a large
mountain range, covered in the most part by a dense forest, but with the
snowy peaks glaeming in the light. A rough trail leads down to the valley
floor, and to the south a dark cave opens ominously into the mountains
of Moria....

At the Valley~
What a beautiful place !  You sigh as you hear the birds singing
and the water from a small stream gurgle as it flows by.  You would guess
that no-one has used this path on which you trod since the Dwarven Invasion!
Just the thought of the dwarves makes you shudder, but they haven't been
seen in years.  There's nothing to worry about.  The small path leads
north and up to a ledge.  If you want to, you could also walk on the rocks
in the stream and go south.

By the small stream~

The sounds of nature calm your nerves as they bring pleasure to your ears.
Still, you can't help but feel uneasy about the tall, brooding mountains
that surround you.

At the mountians~
        The valley ends abruptly at a large mountain.  To the West, a
small stream splashes its way from a hole in the mountain face.  
There must be an underground water system around here.  You feel a
strange rumbling coming from the ground and from inside the mountain.  
It could just be an underground waterfall, but you aren't sure.  
The path leads up the mountain side and south to a lake.
