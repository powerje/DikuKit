A Meditation Chamber~
  You enter a room wrapped in royal purple curtains that flow onto the floor
and encircle a brazier that emits a dense encloakment of incense.  Ranged across
the flowing curtains are soft and shiny colored strips of cloth...it almost looks
like one big flower.  Near the brazier are several cushions for you kneel on
so that your body may rest while your mind ranges across the cosmos in perfect
reflection.  The sound of your breathing echoes but softly before being absorbed
by the room.

Western hallway~
  More allegories written on parchment scrolls hang along the walls.  By soft
candle-light you read of the warrior who forsakes the sword.  Known across the land
as the 'Right Hand of Doom', this warrior meets a young nun who he attempts to 
kill.  Yet, the trees and roots of the forest themselves protect her from such
earthly danger.  In shame, bested by Nature and the Nun's piety, the warrior
casts off his earthly entanglements and joins in the harmony of peaces.  Hmmm
perhaps you should consider this too....

merely walls and wood, for along the sides of this hall hang large scrolls that
contain parables and allegorical tales of piety and sanctity.  Pausing for a
moment, you read about the donkey who meets the dragon...how delightful.

  More candles greet your vision as you continue down the hall deeper into the 
solitude and silence.  Despite the sparce design of the temple, there is a
craftmanship to the walls and panelling that indicates a patience and 
dedication to this sanctified temple.  Absent the opulence of those bloated
on wealth, these halls are rich in stained woods that make you feel at one
with your self.  Though shadows dance and darkness creeps around the 
flickering of candlelight, there is a sense of openess and security.

  You feel a cool breeze brush across your face and slip underneath your 
heavy load of equipment....SIGH* that feels good.  Although still extremely 
quiet, you feel quite alive and energetic.  You notice that this section of 
the hallway, unlike others has a large tapestry that depicts a sleeping 
dragon being read a fairy tale by a kindly old man.  Hurry along...theres 
much more to see.

   You re-enter the isolation of the temple with its candles and quiet 
solitude. Alternating on each side of the hall you notice stained wooden 
paddles each engraved with a proverb of peace, solitude and harmony.  As 
you peer down the hallway you see a dark shape moving around...perhaps its 
not so harmonious here.

that the danger is over, you notice that the curtains all have the Chi symbol 
embroidered in black surrounded by a circle of green stars.  Perhaps the 
monks here created these banners as method of meditation and concentration.  
Although the curtains block your view, you notice the hallway continues west.

   Directly in front of you against the wall is beautifully stained oak 
bannister with golden dragons as handles and legs.  Polished to a shiny 
cherry red, the wood seems to almost absorb the light of the candles ranged 
along the walls.  On the top of the bannister sits a platinum water bowl 
gracefully designed and polished to a bright sheen.  You'd think the 
bannister was too rich a piece for some quiet monks....You hear a slight 
murmer fromt he north passage that fades quickly, and then total silence 
again from all directions.

   A small pitcher of water and several glasses rest upon a table near two 
short and squat benches.  These benches look extremely uncomfortable and you
doubt that anyone would want to sit here long.  A large tome on a pedastal
lies open that reads...  "seek not to escape thy fate; our path has been chosen
ere long we forget."  You begin to puzzle over such a phrase when you hear that
muffled murmer once again coming from the north.

   You turn a bright red when you realize you have burst in on a confession by 
a penitent wanderer.  The elegant marroon curtains that cloak this room only serve
to highlight your flushed face.  You wonder whether you should exit gracefully
or stay and wither under the icy glare of the monk.  But then you'll never find
out what secrets are held farther along to the east...

saint.  Arranged in a web like pattern that reflects their connection to all 
life are several wooden flat disks, each holding a burning rod of incence.  
The aromatic smoke wafts upwards in wispy clouds of floating dragons and 
flying machines.  How peaceful to dwell in the sanctity of the mind and touch 
the soul.

   You feel ashamed of violating the sanctity of this chamber for arranged in
perfect symmetry are rows and rows of candles that cast rays of golden light 
through a cloud of incense.  Absent are the frescos and colors found in other 
rooms--this room stands start in its purity and empty of all distractions to 
the body or mind.  Engraved around the candles is the worm Ourorouboros--the 
snake that eats its own tail--the symbol of continuity and connection with 
the self.

  So enganged were you by the stories that you just now realize that you have  
come to a split in the passageway.  On the wall across from you is a mural of 
a doe resting in a beautiful flower garden, surrounded by an amorphous light
of unknown source.  You wonder what significance such a mural holds and perhaps
imagine that you can even smell the fragrant aroma of the mural's garden. Maybe
you would cast off your armor if you ever found such a heavenly place to rest.

and innocent child of 6 years old. This time the monk's face is filled with anger
for the shame you bring to this child.  Damn...you better get out of here fast...

pennants of subdued colors signal the changing of the seasons and or prayer 
time.  Distantly, you hear the towel bell echo and reverbate through the 
temple.

  So enganged were you by the stories that you just now realize that you have  
come to a split in the passageway.  On the wall across from you is a mural of 
a doe resting in a beautiful flower garden, surrounded by an amorphous light
of unknown source. You wonder what significance such a mural holds and perhaps
imagine that you can even smell the fragrant aroma of the mural's garden. 
Maybe you would cast off your armor if you ever found such a heavenly place 
to rest.

Entrance to the Temple Gardens~
  You stand before an arch engraved with icons of the sun, the moon, and the
the seasons--symbols of prosperity and life. Your eyes wander across a vast 
expanse of color that has no shape but blurrs and weaves in myrid patterns, 
yet you sense a deep order in the pattern grounded in the very ebb and flow 
of life.  Pugnent aromas waft upward and fill you eyes with sensations of 
warm days and cool nights.  Tread carefully here...every step is tranquil 
beauty and every mis-step a violation of the order embodied in the world.

A Meditation Chamber~
   From the center of the room a cloud of incense arises from a pit in the 
floor. Peering down into the cloud, you become quite serene and notice almost 
dreamily a glossy black grey etched stone that emites a soft wave of warmth.  
Heady with smoke, you rest your bones on the warm floor and focus your eyes 
on a series of symbols that seem to blur and shift.  Stay here much longer 
and you may fall asleep.

North East Passageway~
   Directly in front of you against the wall is beautifully stained oak 

bannister with golden dragons as handles and legs.  Polished to a shiny 
cherry red, the wood seems to almost absorb the light of the candles ranged 
along the walls.  On the top of the bannister sits a platinum water bowl 
gracefully designed and polished to a bright sheen.  You'd think the 
bannister was too rich a piece for some quiet monks....You hear a slight 
murmer fromt he north passage that fades quickly, and then total silence 
again from all directions.

quiet, you feel quite alive and energetic.  You notice that this section of 
the hallway, unlike others has a large tapestry that depicts a sleeping 
dragon being read a fairy tale by a kindly old man.  Hurry along...theres 
much more to see.

   You come to the end of the passage where a large stained glass window is 
thrown open and the air is soft and fresh.  The stained glass windows are 
immaculately crafted with a radiant spectrum of colors depicting a flock of 
sheep under a massive willow tree with braches brushing the ground.  Your 
eyes glance out the window to the expansive night sky filled with soft clouds 
illuminated by a half crescent moon.  You almost fall asleep staring at such 
beauty...but you hear several large bells ringing from the east of you.

Head Monks Private Chamber~
   You feel ashamed of violating the sanctity of this chamber for arranged in
perfect symmetry are rows and rows of candles that cast rays of golden light 
through a cloud of incense.  Absent are the frescos and colors found in other 
rooms--this room stands start in its purity and empty of all distractions to 
the body or mind.  Engraved around the candles is the worm Ourorouboros--the 
snake that eats its own tail--the symbol of continuity and connection with 
the self.

   You always thought monks lived in sparce purity yet this room seems to 
glow with a feeling of life, despite the solitude and quiet.  On each side 
of the room is an alcove filled with candles and...yes a fresco of a patron 
saint.  Arranged in a web like pattern that reflects their connection to all 
life are several wooden flat disks, each holding a burning rod of incence.  
The aromatic smoke wafts upwards in wispy clouds of floating dragons and 
flying machines.  How peaceful to dwell in the sanctity of the mind and touch 
the soul.

   Several chunks of amythyst reflect light from candles into the cloud of
incense wafting around the rooms.  Engraved into the floor are 7 concentric rings
that flow with bright clear blue water which surround a tripod burns seasoned
roots and herbs. You dip your finger into the icy water and listen to the soft
crackling of the tripods fire.  Here again, you find quiet and solitude for a
restful peace.

Though the room is extremely spacious, sounds seem to fade away without an 
echo. You feel that this is a perfect room for some peace and quiet.

  You are in an old basement painted with old asian designs and symbols in 
day-glo colors.  Hung crookedly are some paintings by Degas, Roger and Martin 
Dean's Dragons, and Michael Whelan.  Black lights illuminate several matresses 
laid on the floors piled hugh with colored pillows.  Curiously enough, theres 
about 8 booths along the side wall--dark and hidden--each with a bottle of JD 
and an ashtray. Stuck in one corner is an old Happy Days jukebopx with 
everything from the Platters to NIN and Indigo Girls.  You wonder how Meerlo 
can get any work done here but then maybe he doesnt...
