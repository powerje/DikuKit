{BO,B}Path to a Mansion{bo,b}~


  {BO,R}As lightning strikes you can see storm clouds gathering in the 
  distance and the silhouette of an old abandoned mansion.  Hopefully
  this will be a safe place to wait out the storm.{bo,r}

{BO,B}Path to a Mansion{bo,b}~


  {BO,R}As the first drops of icy water pelt against your face you 
  get the first good look at the mansion. A set of marble 
  stairs lead to an ancient wooden door.  The adjacent windows
  are boarded and it looks as if no one has lived here in
  years.{bo,r}

{BO,B}On the Stairs{bo,b}~


  {BO,R}After catching your breath at the top of the stairs you begin
  to bang against the huge oak door.  The rain starts to pour
  soaking through your cloak, so you decide it is time to break
  in and get out of this storm.  However, slamming your shoulder
  repeatedly into the door does no good.  Having given up hope 
  you lean against the door to rest and it gives way throwing
  you head over heels across the threshold. {bo,r}

{BO,B}Inside the Mansion{bo,b}~


  {BLA}After picking yourself off the floor, you try to look around only
  to find that you are surrounded by darkness.  Using your hands you 
  try to feel the walls around you only to end up elbow deep in 
  cobwebs.  Lightning strikes nearby and lights up the room through
  a window to the far right.  Luckily, there is a candle stick on 
  table near by.  You hold your breath and feel your way over to the 
  small table and grasp the candle.  Immediately the candle wick 
  bursts into flame.  After the initial shock you take a look around.
  All you can make out in the gloom is old furniture covered in
  spider webs.  Suddenly you feel something crawl across your neck. 
  Oh Gezzus!! Why does it have to be spiders?  You hate spiders.{bla}

  {BLA}Slowly you search the huge foyer noticing a balcony high above.  
  Odd, how do you get up there?  Your clothes are soaked, your
  skin like ice, and you're really not sure this is somewhere you

  {BLA}A grand set of stairs gently wind up into the darkness.  An old red
  stained carpet guides you up. Many of these stains look as if 
  they may be blood.  Maybe you would fair better in the storm? 
  Too late now, it would be impossible to find your way out without
  the light of day to help you.  Hopefully you will find a dry change
  of clothes and a warm bed upstairs.  If you are lucky that will be

  hanger. Wow the owner of this place really does have skeletons
  in his closet. You chuckle and reach around the skeleton to fumble
  through the moth eaten clothing. As you look for something warm
  to change into you suddenly stiffen as you feel the cold touch of a
  skeletal hand close around your arm. When you attempt to back out
  of the closet the wind is knocked out of you as you take a hard blow
  to the chest.{bla}

  you look around a gigantic rat emerges out of the corner.  He's
  walking on his hind legs and is almost as tall as you.  Suddenly
  the rat starts hissing and you see fangs, before you can react
  he darts at you trying to take a chunk out of you.{bla}

  there is a caretaker still keeping the grounds.{bla}

  lightning and hear distant thunder.  But anything has to be better
  than the rats in the kitchen.  Somewhere ahead you see a white
  marble fountain.  It's beauty is too much for words.  The fountain
  emanates an eerie glow that tugs at your soul and pulls you closer.{bla}

  {BLA}Climbing the stairs toward the second floor you are attacked
  by a swarm of bats that swoop down at your head. They are pesky
  little creatures but with luck you will not get bit.  Once,
  you saw a documentary on TV about how they treat rabies and it
  does not look appealing.{bla}

  {BLA}After fighting your way through the swarms of bats you finally
  make it to the second floor. The hallway stretches east and west
  into the darkness. You see one door on each side of the hall
  and wonder what else could be here.{bla}

{BO,C}East Hall{bo}~


  {BO,R}You feel plush expensive carpet give under you as you step into
  the east hallway. The walls are lined with dark paneling and 
  once again covered in cobwebs. Old paintings line each side of 
  the hall. Each one depict a soul more disturbed than the one 
  before. With each step you take you feel the eyes of these long
  dead people following you.{bo,r}

  {R}You have entered the study, which is now eerily quiet.
  Books lie piled up on a desk in front of you, covered
  in dust and cobwebs. A small typewriter in the corner
  of the room draws your attention. A broken typewriter
  key sticks out and you can tell that the typewriter has
  not been used in a long, long time. A red substance,
  seemingly blood, stains the typewriter.{r}

  {R}This room seems to be fit for a king. A large bed
  sits in the middle of the room, warm and inviting.
  You contemplate taking a nap but then it dawns on
  you: who would possibly sleep on such a huge bed?
  You can only imagine the monstrous being that might
  lie down on this mattress every night...if they even
  sleep at all during the night, that is.{r}

  It is covered in red Velvet and looks like every chamber 
  you have seen in every cliche Vampire movie. Right 
  down to the coffin in the middle of the room. I am sure
  he will not be too happy if you wake him up, especially
  when he sees the stake in your hands.{bo,r}

   {W}You enter a small alley and are immediatly jumped
   by a demon. Another jumps in behind you blocking
   your way. Looks like your only option is to fight.
   But the alley is very narrow making it hard to 
   manuever. If you can get past them the alley opens
   up into a wide area. {w}

   Here in the back of the alley you see the leader
   of the gang and a couple of his thugs attacking
   some innocent people. You run up to him and punch
   the leader right in the back of the head. He turns
   and laughs at your pathetic attempt to hurt him.

   After all the stress of being dead and coming
   back to life then digging your way out of your 
   grave you come home for some rest. But as you 
   get home everything seems to start going wrong. 
   It seems you have brought something back with 
   you and the only way for it to live is to kill
   you. This will be easier said then done you hope.

   You are heading up the stairs to the second floor.
   One of the steps creak loudly on your way up. Just
   as you reach the top landing the mist comes out of 
   the wall and hits you causing you to stumble
   halfway back down the stairs until you recover your
   balance.

   of you is Dawn's bedroom and to the west is 
   Willow and Terra's bedroom. So which of these
   girls bedrooms will you hit first. So many 
   choices so little time.
