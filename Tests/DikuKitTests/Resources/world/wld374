{B,BO}A street in Osaka{b,bo}~

    {CYAN,BO}Every stupid street in this place looks
    the exact same, because the houses are so high
    you don't even know where the castle is anymore.
    none of the villagers speak any english so
    they're no help.  The only way to get to
    the castle is run around.... hopefully not
    in circles.
