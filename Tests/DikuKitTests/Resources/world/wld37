The entrance to the catacombs~
    The air smells rotten and heavy. The breath of death
surrounds you. Silence all over the place. You shiver!
The little room you are standing in is dirty and looks,
as if no mortal has been here for a very long time. You
can go north into the catacombs (if you really want it),
or up to some fresher air.

	You are at the bottom of the black shaft. Your feet stand on (of
better in) something you don't even want describe. The smell is breathtaking.
There are bones scattered onto the floor. The walls are wet. On the northern
wall you can see some scratches, as if it hase been moved very often. Spiders
and rats would like this place, but not you. There is a metal ladder leading
up.

At the end of the winding tube~
	You are at the end of this winding little tube. Some water is at
the bottom of this room. The northern wall is full of scratches. As if
it hase been moved very often. The tube leads up with an angle of about
45 degrees.

The rusty metal grate looks very heavy and old. There are little runes 
engraved on some parts of it. But you can't read them. They seem to be
very old too.

The quiet room~
	This is a neat little room compared with the rest of the Catacombs. 
The floor and the walls are dry, and there are NO bones lying around. The
walls are made of a black, strange looking material, absorbing most of
the normal sounds. Near the middle of the southern wall you see a rusty
metal grate. There is a wooden door leading north.
