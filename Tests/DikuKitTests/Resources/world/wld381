{M}Valet Parking.{G}~

{M}     As you walk towards the large building, the bright
     flashing lights displaying the racetracks name is
     almost blinding you at times.

     You feel the {G}{BLINK}Moneylust{blink}{M} run through your veins as
     you are pulled towards the building by a force unknown.

{R}Entrance to Woodbine Racetrack.{G}~

     As you walk into the racetrack, you smell
     the overpowering smell of success and 
     utter failure.  Yet your legs still carry
     you onward.

     To the north of you is where they check
     your ID, better hope you have yours.

{B,BO}     As you wait in the short lineup for the large man
     in the bullet proof vest to check your id, you
     study the faces of those around you, many asians
     and women wearing tacky seemingly spray-painted
     gold bags and shoes.  Men with open shirts hairy chests
     and excessive gold chains. Finally the line moves
     forward and you come closer to the {W}Bouncer.{G}

Bathrooms.~

     Somewhat clean bathrooms, with the likely
     smell of urinal pucks, cologne/perfum,
     and on the wall a dispencer for needles.
     whoa, what have you gotten yourself into?
     Seems that there may be a hidden underground
     world to this racetrack afterall...

     {C}Nice elevator music is playing in the 
     backround as you walk into the beautifully
     decorated bar. Everyone seems to be dressed

{R,BO}     Strange, as you only walked up one small flight
     of stairs, yet you are in a very nice revolving
     upperclass resturaunt. Immediately the hostess
     comes over to you and points out that you must
     wear a tie to be a patron of this establishment.

{B,BO}

     Carnage and death everywhere. The seemingly
      nice rich folk who frequent this establishment
     have turned on you. Luckily, your brains and
     cat-like reflexes have taken you this far into
     the Night Mare.
     Enjoy your food.

{C,BO}The Stands. {bo}{G}~

     {C}You are standing in the shaded stands
     the horses are going around and around.
     The heat is making you feel so heavy and 
     drained.  Maybe a nap would be nice?

     But then you wont know if your horse won...
     Oh what to do...

     As you walk into the entrance of the V.{W}I.{B}P.{R} area
     A man comes quickly over to you with a radio. 
     He thinks he is important, simply working here.

     Money dosen't qualify you for V.{W}I.{B}P.{R}
