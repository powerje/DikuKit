Walkway~
{WHITE}{BOLD}You find yourself on a cement walkway leading up to the kind of 
two-story house you would expect to find on any quite street in 
Smallown, USA.  A nicely cultivated lawn spreads out on both sides of 
the walkay.  It seems very peaceful... birds chirping, a dog barking in 
the distance.  As you are about to settle into the peaceful scene, you 
hear a lawn motor start up nearby.  The sound of its motor wrecks the 
peacefulness of your surroundings.  It sounds angry.{bold}{white}

Walkway~
{WHITE}{BOLD}You are on the walkway in front of the porch.  As you approach the 
house, it seems like you may have shrunk.  You didn't notice it before 
but you seem to be looking at the things around you from the 
perspective of a toddler.  Interesting.  You wonder what other 
surprises are in store.{bold}{white}

Under the Tree~

and you feel like settling down to take a nap.  Looking up, you 
notice a small tree house with a rope ladder leading up to it.  
It looks cozy and you can hear laughter of little girls coming 
from inside.{green}

The Treehouse~
{MAGENTA}After climbing up the ladder, you find yourself in a small treehouse.  
Looking around, you find it to be like most other childhood hideouts.  
There are numerous toys and dolls spread around.  In addition, on the 
walls, drawings have been pinned up.  They were  obviously done by 
children, depiciting fantasy scenes of unicorns prancing with 
princesses or a heroic knight rescuing a fair damsel.  All of these 
done in the brillant colors of crayons.  You notice two small girls 
playing with toy horses in the center of the clubhouse.  One of them 
looks up at you innocently and sweetly asks you, "{magenta}{CYAN}{BOLD}Would you like to 
play Magical Pony Princesses with us?{bold}{cyan}{MAGENTA}"{magenta}

Hallway~
{CYAN}You enter the house and look around.  You are in a hallway.  There is a 
table next to the door with some flowers on.  It seems huge to you.  
You can just peer over the top of it.  Judging from the numerous family 
pictures on the wall, you are in the house of a family consisting a 
father, a mother, and two kids.  Gosh, they seem so happy... now you 
know you have entered a land of fiction.  Look, there is a picture of 
them by the pool.  You notice they are all laughing as the father 
pushes his poor little son into the water.  The father and mother look 
middle aged.  You judge the age of the daughter about 8.  She looks so 
cute.  The son looks like the next Enrico Fermi.  He seems to be 
wearing the same lab coat in all his pictures.
To the north, there is an archway through which you can see a spacious
living room.  To the west, the hallway continues.{cyan}

Hallway~
{CYAN}In this section of the hallway, there are more family pictures 
containing happy images.  Oh look, there is one of the family in one of 
those restaurants you stop in on road trips which are filled with truck 
drivers and the waitress is invariably named Flo.  The father is 
engaged in an arm wrestling match with a big hairy guy that looks like 
he could squash any normal sized man without even breaking out in a 
sweat.  Funny... the father's right arm is encased in a huge metal 
gauntlet with steam coming out of it.  To the north, you see the dining 
room.{cyan}

Kitchen~
{CYAN}The first thing you notice about this kitchen is that is impeccably 
clean.  The next thing is how big everything appears to you.  All of 
the counter tops are over your head, leaving you wondering what could 
be on top of them.  There is a woman wearing an apron bustling 
around preparing dinner.  She has her back to you but you can still 
recognize her as the one from the photos in the hallway.  As you enter, 
you hear her say, "{cyan}{MAGENTA}Is that you, Dexter?  I told you that you have to 
wait until dinner, honey.  No cookies... they will spoil your appetite.{magenta}{CYAN}"{cyan}

count the chairs and come up with 6.  There is a also the standard 
setup in the center of the table with salt and pepper shakers, a napkin 
holder, as well as a lovely flower arrangemnt.{cyan}

Against one wall, there is a 35' TV with a couch facing it.  There are 
also two recliners, one on either side of the couch facing the TV.  
Over in another corner, you see a man you recognize from the pictures 
in the hallway.  He must be the father.  He appears to be relaxing 
after a hard day's work, reading the newspaper and smoking a pipe.  As 
you enter, he says without looking up, "{YELLOW}Hello Dexter.  Please, try to 
keep the noise down.{yellow}{CYAN}"
You notice a door to the west and a stairway leading up to the second 
floor.{cyan}

comfortable.  There is a nightstand on either side of the bed.  
They both contain night lamps.  On the one on the left, there is a 
plain looking phone.  On the one on the right, there is a book.  On 
closer inspection, you see it title "Atlas Shrugged," by someone named 
Ayn Rand.  You shake your head wondering at why someone would read that 
many pages of nonsense.{cyan}

floor.  Looking over the railings, you can see down into the living 
room.  There are two doorways at each end of the hall.  The one of the 
left is pink and has heart stickers all over it... very obvious the 
room of the daughter.  To the right is the door which could only be 
that of the little boy's.  You see a large padlock intended to keep 
unwanted guests out.  As if to leave no questions, you see a large sign 
that says "DANGER! KEEP OUT" on the door.  Hmmm... which way to go.{cyan}

{MAGENTA}As you walk in, your senses are assaulting by undoubtedly the cutest
little room you have ever seen.  Ever where you look, you see pink.  
Pink wallpaper with pink hearts.  Pink lace curtains covering the 
windows.  Pink teddy bears piled around.  Gosh, sickening.   Finally, 
your tortured gaze rests upon the little girl bouncing on the pkink 
bed.  She notices you about the same time you see her.  She hops off 
the bed, smiles the biggest, cutest smile, and says in her high pitched 
voice, "{magenta}{WHITE}Hi! My name's Deedee... what's yours? Hehehehehe.{white}{MAGENTA}"  You feel a 
strong desire to make the world a better place and kill her immediately.

{BLUE}You enter a room that is extremely well organized.  You see a bed that 
is made so tightly you could bounce quarters off of it.  It could be 
mistaken for a cot in an army bunker, if it wasn't for the bedspread 
covered in mathematical equations.  There is a picture depicting an
ancient galleon on a turbulant ocean on the east wall.Out of curiosity, 
you walk over to closet and yep, it is just lab coat after lab coat after 
lab coat.  You notice the desktop computer and are curious as to whether 
or not he has the latest P2-400 or not.  You touch the keyboard and 
immediately realize you have made a mistake.  Sirens start blaring and 
the room is immediately plunged into darkness, broken only by flashing 
red lights.  Two lazers pop out of the wall and start shooting at you.{blue}

Inside Dexter's Laboratory~
{WHITE}You slide down the chute ends suddenly when you land in a big pile of 
pillows.  Slowly you get up and look around.  You find yourself in a 
large underground complex.  It stretches off into the distance.  It is 
huge!  You look up and see that the cieling is so high it is obscured 
in shadows.  The place feels cold... all smooth featureless metal and 
sharp edges.  You hear movement in the darkness nearby and you feel a 
certain menace about this place.  You resolve to be careful.{white}

just did was pointless.  Did you think you would find treaasure it the 
oven?  Did you expect to find a monster?  If so, how would you fight it 
all cramped up like you?  Above all, the heat is starting to get 
uncomfortable.  Immediately, you start looking for a way to get out of 
here.  Luckily, it aseems that those few ponds you lost last week is 
going to allow you to just squeeze out.{r}

with this comes other side effects.  Things don't seem as serious as 
they once did, like you have less things to worry about.  As well, you 
feel a burst of energy like you could go running around the yard 
screaming your head off for no reason.  Hey, you feel like a kid

like the rest of the lab; cold, clean, smooth.  The major difference is 
there is a lot more activity here.  You hear constant bells, whistles,

amazement at all the robots here... each seeming to have a task that 
they are bent on completing before moving on to the next.  You see one 
little robot zooming around on tank treads, continously checking 
numerous gauges in the chamber.  Another is bent over a circuit board, 
welding away.  None of the seem to notice you.{white}

Computer Room~
{WHITE}Here you find the largest computer screen you have ever seen.  
It takes up almost the whole entire west wall.   On the other walls, 
there are numerous feeds of paper filled with data spilling out of 
slots, as well as numerous small screens with data flashing across 
them.  Amazing.  In the center of the room is a small desk with a 
keyboard built into it.  Seated at the desk is a small figure with dark 
hair typing away.  You accidently trip over some paper spilled across 
the floor.  He turns at the sudden noise.  The little nerd looks at you 
with a sneer and says, "{white}{MAGENTA}You can call me Mandark.{magenta}"  {WHITE}He then leaps at you 
and battle is joined.{white}

A Loose T-Rex!~
{WHITE}This room is in chaos.  You see whole sections of the wall ripped 
away exposing circuitry and wiring.  Scraps of metal lay 
everywhere.  You cautiously dodge swinging wires that are giving off 
sparks.  You are not left in wonder as to what has caused the 
destruction for very long though.  There is a gigantic {white}{GREEN}T-Rex{green}{WHITE} 
standing in the middle of the room.  It turns its head towards you.  
It looks hungry. Uh oh!{white}.

Control Room~

both walls running along the length.  There are numerous stools 
set at various spots.  You look at the controls to see if you can make 
any sense out of them.  You can't.  None of them are labelled and there 
are so many of them...  The screens filled with data don't make sense 
either.  Looking north, you see a door at the other end.  It has a 
clear panel in it through which shines a bright flickering light.   
Hmmm.... must be a power source.{white}

{WHITE}You have finally found the genius behind the wonders and horrors found
in this lab.  He is working on an experiment.  It must be extremely 
dangerous because he is wearing a mechanized exoskeleton that is about 
twice as big as he is without it.  As you enter, he looks at you.  His 
face twists in anger.{white}  {CYAN}{BOLD}Who are you?  Did stoooopid DeeDee let you 
in?  How dare you invade my laboratory?{bold}{cyan}{WHITE}"  He turns to face you.  
Normally, you wouldn't be frightened but that exoskeleton does look 
formidable.

{W}{BOLD}You are in a strange chamber. You can feel power flowing around
 you, which seems to sink into your inner being, bringing a feeling of 
inner calmness. It makes you feel as if you are ultimately powerful and 
knowledgeable, yet with the ultimate wisdom and intelligence needed to 
endure the temptation to abuse this. At first, you are disoriented 
because it appears you are floating in space, but on closer inspection, 
you realize that you are standing on an obsidian floor, polished to a 
high finish such that the stars that are shining through the huge windows 
stretching from floor to ceiling completely encircling the chamber, are 
reflected in perfect clarity.  There are a few objects in the huge room 
which are the only things that give you a sense of position. In the center 
of the room is a pedastal a figurine of an extremely beautiful woman on 
it.{w}{bold}
