The City-limits.~

  {BOLD}{B}Before you spreads a large metropolis. The moon is black
  and the sky is the color of de-oxygenated blood.
  Screams rip down the streets and alleys carried by
  maladorous winds. The people of this place trudge the
  sidewalks back and forth, to home, to work, and to the
  stores. Just as they do in any city, yet there is one
  dissimilarity. In this city, the people are dead.

{BOLD}{B}Before the city.{bold}{b}~

  {R}Hell{r} {BOLD}{B}is a city, not an endless lake of fire. It has evolved
  over the millennia, just as on Earth. It stretches, literally
  without end. A labyrinth of smoke and waking nightmare. Clock
  towers spire in every district, though by public law, their
  faces have no hands. Time here is not measured in seconds or
  hours, but in atrocity and despair.
  Welcome to Mephistopolis.
  Welcome to the city of {bold}{R}Hell{BOLD}{B}.{bold}{b}

hell~

  {R}You think back to the bible, and remember a small passage
  you have read. Revelations, Chapter 21. Saint John
  actually revealed the physical dimensions of Heaven. As
  big as this city appears to be, Lucifer must have used
  the same measurements when building this city. You think
  to yourself, thats a long time for hell to grow. Should
  you even be here?

  As you look around trying to clear your head from the impact.
  You realize what you thought while falling was true. You just
  slid right down into a freakin dumpster. To make matters
  worse when you fell the lid slammed shut. Trying to pick the
  filth off of your freshly repaired and polished equipment...
  you hear someone, or something grunt and realize that you are
  not alone.

  the poor woman can do is scream for someone to help her.
  She yells for the police over and over. Only to have one
  of the demons to chuckle and say. Honey we ARE the Police.

{C}Privacy Room{c}~

  {W}Opening the hidden door the real reason for all of the
  rumors about the {C}Champagne Room {W}becomes clear. Behind
  it is a hallway that leads on to another room. Reaching
  for the door a {B}muffled sound {W}resonates from the corner.
  There is {B}no one {W}or {B}nothing {W}to be seen in here. Yet,
  you can't shake the feeling that you are not alone.{w}
