A Well Traveled Road~
 Just off the main path there is a small
road that cuts mysteriously through a 
thick lush forest.  It seems to be safe 
as you can here the birds flitting through 
the tree tops chirping a happy song.

A Well Traveled Road~

Continuing along the small road the air becomes cooler 
as the forest begins to close in. The path is dimmer 
now as the tree tops have begun to block the sunlight.  
The birds continue to sing their merry song and a 
river quietly murmurs in the distance.

A Well Traveled Road~
What a nice day for a leisurely walk down a shady road.  
Then suddenly the path  is growing dimmer and dimmer.  
The forest is beginning to close in further, blocking out much 
of the sunlight.  This walk isn't so leisurely any more.

A Turn in the Road~
This point in the road turns towards the easterly direction.  
The forest gets thicker and a smarter person would wonder if 
continuing would be a good idea.  But the forest no blocks 
the way back.  The only direction to go is forward.

A Tidy Path~
This path seems to lead to a curious mound of dirt in the 
distance.  You also see some large black crows circling 
above what seems to be someone's garden.

A Tidy Path~
Up close you realize that the mound of dirt is a rabbit's 
burrow.  You conclude this from the sign here that says: 
"Rabbit's House".  In front of the burrow is a tidy little 
vegetable garden.

Rabbit's Vegetable Garden~
You see neat little rows of carrots, cabbage and corn here 
in the garden.  In the center of the garden is a funny, 
lopsided scarecrow.  Even the crows find it more 
amusing than scary because this garden is infested with 
them despite a sign here that shouts "NO KROWS!".
