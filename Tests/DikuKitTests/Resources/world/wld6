  WATCH OUT!!!! That rattler might come for 
  you as you venture through the fairway! You 
  never know what creatures you may find on your
  adventure through this course. Hope they aren't
  too distracting. Just keep your eye on the ball!
  With this being the first hole it won't be as 
  difficult, but best be on your toes!

{BLU}Lake Jezl{blu}~

  The calm surface of Lake Jezl is only
  disturbed by a few ducks that ignore
  all warnings and go for a swim. The 
  lake is the final resting place of 
  Lady Jezl, the dinner boat, which sank
  into the lake's floor. A piece of the
  boat peeks out at the surface to remind
  others of her presence. When the boat
  sunk, rescuers did all they could to
  save the crew, but failed. Lady Jezl
  awaits extraction from the lake.

{BLU}Lake Jezl{blu}~
{BLUE,BO}
  On the edge of Lake Jezl, the water is 
  shallow and clear. The lake's center 
  reaches depths that are unexplored. Rumour
  has it that the body of an unknown and
  unauthorized diver washed ashore some 
  time ago. To this day, golfers have been
  known to just leave their balls in the
  depths of Lake Jezl.

{BLU,BO}
  This large club house is for members only.
  The decor suggests relaxation and 
  socialization. Here members meet to network,
  schmooze clientele, and kick back with the 
  buds. In the corner is a solid mahogany bar
  tended to at all hours. Three oxblood leather 
  couches are arranged in front of the fireplace
  while three others are arranged in front of
  the large screen television. The showers,
  restrooms, and management office are hidden 
  behind a wall at the far north of the room.

  Hidden behind the wall are the 
  management offices, showers, and 
  restrooms. Since you are here just
  for the day, you will not be needing
  such rooms. However, if there is 
  something you need, be sure to ask
  any of the club's members for assistance.

  Looking out the rear window of
  the club house at the lush, neatly
  manicured greens, you can't help 
  but feel a rush of happiness. A
  day here at the club is sure to do
  you some good.
