  Peasants and the occasional Samurai pass you
  by, giving you and members of the Caravan a

  are disgusted at everyone's crude Gaijin
  appearance.

  From what you overheard from some of the
  people travelling in the Caravan, the road
  to the south leads directly to {y}{R}Kyuden Bayushi{r}{Y},
  apparently the capitol of something called the

  Suddenly, she turns around.

  Gazing upon her face seems to be staring in to oblivion

{R}The True path of the Scorpion{r}~
{R}
  The true path of the Scorpion is not an easy
  one.

  It is a path of self-sacrifice and pain.
  It is to become evil to fight evil.
  It is to do the most vile things to protect
  the future, that no one else would dare.

  Do you have the courage to see what is behind
  the Scorpion's mask?
{r}{BLU}
  You are in a tiny clearing at the edge of one
  of the palace walls.  Ther is a small door
  in plain sight.  There are no guards in sight.

  You fall in to the middle of a GIGANTIC POOL OF GREEN MUCK!

  You are up to your neck in Muck, and it appears that you are
  continuing to sink...

  Worse yet, you feel your entire body that is submerged
  below the muck start to burn...


  You die in a matter of minutes.

{g}{BO}The Caves{bo}~
{BO}
  Traveling deeper in this part of the caves, there is
  less and less light.  In the distance your ears pick
  up *something*.  You stop, and stand utterly still
  and try and listen.  It sounds like... rodents??

  To the north, the passage narrows to where you
  will have to turn sideways and squeeze through
  single file.

  you are loose.  It starts to feel like you might
  lose your footing any moment.

  You must get out of this passage!

  Upon entering this gigantic cavern, a mixed scent
  of bat feces, sulfer and decay assails your
  senses.

  There is an underground lake that takes up about
  half the cavern.  Nests of bats and other foul
  vermin cover the walls, ceiling, and floor.
