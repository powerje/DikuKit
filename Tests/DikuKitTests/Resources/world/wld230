The Peaceful Forest~
The cool forest mist envelops you as you enter.  You hear sounds of birds 
chirping.. It seems so very peaceful here.   The trees reach towards the 
heavens while their leaves and branches block out most of the sunlight which
tries to get in.  You feel so comfortable here.  It puts your soul at ease.  
It's a shame you can't stay here forever.

is a temple on that island.  What could it be?

Beach of Shaolin Island~
You have landed on a glorious beach.  It sand sparkles in the sunlight as the 
seagulls squack as they glide throught the sky.  It seems so very peaceful here.
The only exit is to the north so go forth and fear not!!.
and the heavy breaths of exhaustion.  As you look around, you see blood stains
someday hope of earning the title of "Shaolin Monk"!!  As you look around you
see that there is a temple to the north.  But I somehow get the feeling that
you will have to prove yourself to get there!

few will leave here with the title of a Shaolin Monk.  The training is really
intense. Only the cunning will ever get the chance to prove themselves against
the Shaolin Leader, LiuKang.  As you look around you see that the temple is to
the north.

You have enterd a room filled with the stench of blood and sweat.  The room is
filled with practice dummies.  As you look on the wall, you notice that there
is a weapon rack filled with many sharp dangerous lookin weapons.  There are a
few warriors still here, and they seem very exhausted.  They look at you and 
grin. There is only one reason why you should be here.  And that is to battle.

devouring the corpses of falen foes of the Mighty Reptile.  I doubt you can

You are amazed at the beauty of this stairway.  It is made out of pure ivory
and has been sanded down so that it shimmers in the sunlight.  Though the 
stains of blood embedded in the stairs cause it to be less than perfect.  Only
one more flight of stairs till you get to the temple

the front of the gate.  Could it be Liukang?  Phew... these stairs are a trial
by itself.  You sure do get your stairmaster work out here.  The view from here
is also very nice.  You can see the monks fighting in the yard and a view of
the ocean and its beaches.  Oh well just tryin to get your mind off of LiuKang,
I know he scares ya. :)

It's pillars are made of sparkling gold and its gates are a pearly white.  
The temple walls are made out of marble and seem to be polished very well.  For

intimidating. The walls are covered with weapon racks, loaded with weapons.  
At the front of this room you see a shrine, with a picture of an old man above
it. You figure it to be the founding father of Shaolin.  The floor is made
of pure sand.  Was it worth all that trouble just to see this?

you enter this realm without the devine permission of that who rules this area.
He won't be very happy with you.  Hopefully you be smart and head out the way you
came.  You shouldn't mess with the higher powers.
    I think you should get your friends so that you MAY stand a chance.  If you
choose to try and do this solo your one dumb F*#K!!! So drop your ego and
get some help.  You'll need it.  Even then you may die!!! MORTAL KOMBAT!!

Yuk, looking closer you notice they are have a nasty green ooze
dripping from their mouths.  The floor sizzles and burns as the

Before the Shrine~
   You have found the secret entrance to the shrine of Shao Kahn.   Not many
can say that they have actually come this far to live to tell about it.  Though
you are not yet at the great shrine, you notice that the pathway is blocked 
by some huge monster.  You can't quite tell what it is but it seems to have
the legs of a horse and the body of a human.
     Can you get past him to get to your destination?  Try your luck.  Good 
luck!!!! MORTAL KOMBAT CONTINUES!!!!!!!

The Shrine of Shaokahn~
   You smell the scent of inscence as you enter the room.  It seems to be 
either a place of worship or a place of sacrifice.  Here in the middle of the 
room you find a statue of the Great Shao Kahn.  He was a force to be reckoned
with in the underworld.  Wait a minute did i say WAS?  Oops my mistake.  
    Oh well,  you have travelled so far just to get here.  You might as well
finish the journey.  Be brave and show no fear.  Live the way of the warrior.
