{BOLD,BLACK}Entrance to the {BOLD,WHITE}Time Machine{bold,white}~

   {BOLD,BLACK}You continue to walk  the {BOLD,GREEN}forest{BOLD,BLACK}, wondering if the rows of {BOLD,GREEN}trees{BOLD,BLACK}
   will ever end. Suddenly, you find  yourself standing in front of
   a {bold,black}{WHITE}large metal door{BOLD,BLACK}. The door is  closed and locked, but gives in
   after a bash or two. Your eyes widen as you look around you. You
   are in some  sort of  high-tech  machine. The  entrance to  this 
   machine  is  {BOLD,YELLOW}well lit{BOLD,BLACK} and  immediately  captures your  attention.
   Dozens of computers  line the  walls, each  projecting the  same 
   message. Maybe you should take a {BOLD,RED}{BLINK}look{blink}{BOLD,BLACK} at the {BOLD,RED}{BLINK}screen{blink}.{bold,red}

{BO,GREE}A Clearing{bo,gree}~

  {BO,GRE} You stand in the middle of a clearing. This meadow
   is void of any trees  and gives you a breathtaking
   view of your surroundings.  There are{bo,gre}{RE} mountains {BO,GRE}in 
   the horizon  in each  direction.  In the middle of 
   this  clearing  is a {BO,BLUE}well{GREEN},  which  appears to have 
   been kept in an {bo,gre}{WHI}immaculate {BO,GREE}condition.  Posted next
   to the well  is a  {BO,YEL}{BLI}sign{bli}{BOLD,GRE}  that  looks like  it  was 
   placed there for a reason. {bo,gre}

The sign reads:
         This is a bottomless pit cleverly disguised as a well.  People have
fallen in and never been heard from again.  Trust me, you don't want to go 
down there.

  You peer over the side of the well.  It looks VERY, VERY deep.  It appears

{RED}   This path leads up the side of the mountain,
   a narrow trail  curling around the towering 
   monument.  Below you,  is a  clearing which 
   looks  ridiculously  out of  place with the

{WHI}A Cave Opening{whi}~

  {WHI} After making your  way  through  the  tunnels, you stand 
   at the opening  of a  giant cave.  There  are many {BO,BLA}bones{bo,bla}{WHIT} 
   strewn  across the earth.  Some are human,  and the rest
   just aren't distinguishable.  It smells very bad in here.
   You  can  hear  movement in the cave to  the north.  The 
   tunnel goes back to the south.{whi}

{BO,BLUE}Atop the MOUNTAIN{bo,blue}~

{BO,BLU}   You are standing at the top of the mountain.  It feels 
  {CY} more like the top of the world.  To your north lies a 
  {BLU} huge platinum door.  You hear a barely audible grumbling 
  {CY} from behind the doors.  It sounds like something huge
 {BLU}  and hungry. But if you don't have the key you don't 
 {CY}  have to worry because you can't get it. If you do have
  {BLU} the key I would suggest not going in.  Some believe the
  {CY} Five Headed dragon Tiamat was imprisoned here by the gods. 
 {BLU}  But who believes in fairy tales.  Well, if you're scared, 
  {CY} you can always go down the mountain.

   I warned you!  You have fallen into the bottomless pit.  You life flashes
