{Y}The Great Causeway{y}~
  
  {BO,Y}On the other side of the Great Gate is a long 
  causeway, cutting a swath through the Great Marsh.
  
  The water gently laps under the footboards - the
  wading birds flock all about you.  You can see 
  nothing beyond the mists over the water, even 
  in broad daylight.{y,bo}
