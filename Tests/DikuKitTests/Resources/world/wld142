  Boy, it's a lot roomier on the inside than it appears on the
 outside. The walls are a steel gray.  On one side there are
 two beds side by side, and a canopy bed next to them. In the
 other corner is a round booth, with a wrap-around bench. Train
 tracks run throughout the tower, and you see the engine off to
 one side, knocked over... into a couple of bookshelves filled
 with Warner Brothers movies. Next to the shelves is a large TV,
 and through an open door you see a big round bubble bath in the
 bathroom.
