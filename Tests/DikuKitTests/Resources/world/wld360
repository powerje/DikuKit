Aboard the Emersus~


{CYAN,BO}You've found yourself on the deck of a large,
six masted ship.  The starbord side informs you that
you're aboard the Emersus.  There's a locked cabin next
to the Captian's, it seems to be the only part of the
ship that you can't get into.

On the Deck~

{CYAN,BO}The deck's deserted, it dosn't even look like anyone's
ever been on this ship.  There's a smell of rot that's leaking
out of the cabins, maybe you should find out what it is

{BLU,BO}The Raging Pacific{blu,bo}~

    {CYAN,BO}You've found yourself in the middle of the Pacific
    Ocean in what might be the largest hurricane in the
    history of large hurricanes,  the Emersus dissapeared
    from sight about two seconds after you were thrown
    overboard.  Your only hope now is to somehow get drifted
    ashore.

    that there's still growth on it is disturbing.  A path
    between a village and a ocean should be pretty well worn,
    this one still has growth on it though.

    The village is becomming a bit clearer now, you can make out
    villagers walking around with funny sombaro-like hats.

    {CYAN,BO}This village looks nothing like the villages you're
    used to from Europe.  The houses are made from some sort
    of fabric or paper even.  There's no trash in the streets
    and no foul smell of rot.  The villagers seem to be wearing
    sombaro's on their heads, only they come to a point at the
    top of their heads.  Strange place you've come upon.

    {CYAN,BO}Finally!  You recognize these people as Japanese!  The
    first portugeese ship to cross the pacific and you were
    on it!  Maybe you can get repairs for the Emersus if you act
    like a diplomat.  You're going to need to find their leader first
    though.

{Y,BO}Main Street Anjiro{y,bo}~

    {CYAN,BO}As you walk farther down the path things become a
    bit clearer to you.  You begin to notice that there's
    only several different hair styles.  What is odviously
    samurai all wear their hair the same, women all have
    the same hair and general clothing.  But it's the eta
    that put a smile on your face.
 
    In Japaneese culture eta are worth about as much as a 
    blade of grass.  They're below pesants, and they did
    nothing more than to be born into poverty.  But they
    are also the most fun-loving and wild Japaneese there
    is.  You think this is your crowd.

    Houses are extremly high class brothels.  The women go

{Y,BO}The Palace Tent{y,bo}~

    {CYAN,BO}Sweet lord, this tent looks like it's packing
    two stories!  There's a damn smokestack comming
    out of this monster.  There's also two elite{cyan,bo} {W}GRAY{w}
    {CYAN,BO}guards hanging out in front, maybe you should kill them.

    {CYAN,BO}You can see inside the tent now, and it's every
    bit as big as you thought it would be.  There's
    a couple of men inside sitting on the ground
    each of them are wearing swords and expensive
    silk.

    {CYAN,BO}Well, you've left the camp behind you now and
    you're on your way to Osaka.  You've heard that Ishido
    and five other Regants are presiding there.  Only
    Toranaga has the power and courage to stand against them.

{Y,BO}Outside Osaka{y,bo}~

    {CYAN,BO}This is unlike anything of this world.  The city
    of Osaka has about seven millon people, it's huge.
    but the impressive part of the city is the fortress
    located in the middle of Osaka.

    Osaka castle was built to support one hundred and
    eighty thousand samurai and ronin.  It's seven
    stories high and built on a hill.  A true testamate
    to the power of human intelligence.

    {CYAN,BO}The Japaneese were amazing with papers and keeping
    track of their citizens.  To enter one providence you
    have to have signed passport papers from the daimyo
    of your providence.  So unless you have papers you
    might as well turn around.

At the docks~

    {CYAN,BO}You're at the docks now.  You're suprised at 
    how few Japaneese ships are in the harbor, But then 
    you remember that the Japaneese are afraid of the water.
    One ship in paticular stands out from the rest.
    THE BLACK SHIP.  It's eneromous!  About as long as
    the Titanic, it's made to carry tons and tons of gold
    and silk to China from Japan.  You decide it's a good
    idea to inspect it further.

Walking down the dock.~

    {CYAN,BO}You're walking down the dock toward The Black Ship,
    soon you realize you have a bit of a problem.  The Black Ship is
    anchored about 1000 yards off shore, and the dock only
    protudes about 50 yards into the water.  You're going
    to have to find some other way to The Black Ship.

A plank to a Galley~

    {CYAN,BO}A galley is a ship that's rowed.  Sure it uses
    sails, but by making samurai row the ship, a diaymo
    can make much better time to his destination.  Also
    Japaneese sailing consists of staying within sight
    of land, by rowing the ship it is assured that you
    always have momentum, even without wind.

{Y,BO}Tokaido Road{y,bo}~

    {CYAN,BO}Christ almighty!  This road is horrid.  It's
    about ten feet wide in places, on one side a cliff
    on the other, a straight drop to the bottom of
    the mountain.  Better watch your step

{Y,BO}In view of a city{y,bo}~

    {CYAN,BO}You can see a large city from here.  You have
    no idea which city it is, but later you learn it's Yokohama
    the first city in Toranga's Kwanto.  You're now offically
    within toranga's grasp.

{Y}Overlooking Yedo{y}~

    {CYAN,BO}Yedo is a strange town.  It was a planned town
    so all the streets are perpendicular to eachother, but
    nearer the castle, the streets come togeather so
    siege devices have a harder time laying waste to
    the castle.  The castle itself dosn't look nearly
    as impressive as Osaka Castle.  There is only
    one tower in it, but that tower must be about
    eight or nine stories high.
