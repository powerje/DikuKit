After you force your way past the guardian of this household. You
enter a nice looking bedroom. Over in the corner you spy a young woman.
The woman has a special aura around her, and now you know why that
strange man was guarding her.

You seem to feel a slight draft coming from the north. You look to the
north to check out the source of the draft, but instead find a bookcase.

You stand before the town of Narshe, the town built inside a mountain. This area 
is good for people of levels 30+, especially in groups. There is some sort of 
floating continent above this town, and that area is much more difficult than 
the town itself. The final 1/8th of the continent should be attempted by a group 
of highly skilled avatars. Good luck.
To the west of you there is a passage that leads to a Ranma 1/2 area. This area 
should be attempted by highly skilled fighters, since the mobs there are real 
tough. 

There might be a few secrets in these two zones, like secret rooms, and secret 
characters. Keep looking, and enjoy!
