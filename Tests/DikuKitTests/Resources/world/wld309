{BO}{BLU}Entrance to the {B}Crossroads {BO}{G}Village{g}~
 
   Here you can hear the hustle and bustle of chariots, horses,
   and people going along the traditional daily grind.  The 
   fresh smell of baked apple pies is in the air and it fills your
   nose with the aroma of sugar.  As your stomach begins to growl,
   you notice the shoppe up ahead.

{BO,G}The Mayor's Office{bo}~
   
   Luxurious furniture and a nice warm fireplace give the room a 
homely feel as you look around.  You are standing inside the 
mayor of Crossroad Village's office.  A large sword is hanging
from the wall in a glass display case.  You've heard tales of
this mayor.  He was once a great warrior.  Perhaps he will share
some of his knowledge with you.

{BO,C}The Armoury{bo}~
   
   A warrior of old sits in the corner of the shop, washing blood from
a piece of chainmail.  He has been hardened by the many years of battle
he has seen, but he manages to give you a faint smile.  His shop is full
of all kinds of pieces of armor.  Some of it looks brand new, while some
of it, like that piece of chainmail the shopkeeper washes, has definitely 
been battle tested.

you.

stands over his anvil with a large hammer repairing a bent sword.  The room's
dark smoke stains stand out in the fire's bright light.  The blacksmith's
clothes are scorched badly.  He smiles as you enter, looking over your 
equipment.

   All types of pies line the shelves of Riley's Pie Shoppe.  There
   are apple pies, chocolate pies, orange pies, black berry cobbler, 
   coconut pies, chess pies, and dwarf pies.  What are dwarf pies you
   ask?  From his explanation, it sounds like he hunts dwarfs on the
   weekends for the filling in his pies.  Let's hope he doesn't want
   to make any group pies anytime soon.

   Around you are the sounds of work, play, and everything in
   between.  This busy village is the footplate for production
   in an otherwise arid desert.  An ancient wizard has figured
   out ways of creating a protective bubble around the city, 
   shielding it from the warmer climate around it.  It is seventy
   two degrees here, always, and everyone seems to have a bronze
   tan anyway.
