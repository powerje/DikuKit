{C,BO}A Goddess's Get Away{c,bo}~
{G}
  From the river of lava to the south springs a spark{Y,BO}li{bo,G}ng pool
  of warm water surrounded by luscious greens of bro{Y,BO}ad {bo,G}leaves and
  feather soft needles. A moss covered rock cre{Y,BO}ates th{bo,G}e perfect 
  {C,BO}slope for two to huggle in the water as the moon{Y}light {bo,G}dances
  {C,BO}through the canopy overhead. A feeling of peace and tr{bo,G}anquility
  {C,BO}rushes through the soul and warms the heart.
