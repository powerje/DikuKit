     There are guards wandering around here.  They look very mean and
heartless.  Up above and all around are cells.  The yelling and screaming
is from the inmates who are all locked-up at the moment.  Better hope

Clamps secure your arms and legs.  A metal shield is lowered over your

through your entire body.  Blood begins to run from your mouth and nose.
You can feel your eyes start to pop from your skull.  
     you are left with only a few breaths in your soul!!
The clamps are released and you fall to the floor.

It is staked in to the side of the wall.  The strength and durability

crawling~
     You emerge from the cold waters of the ocean.  Your body is drained
of all energy from that God awful swim.  Not to mention all the shark
attacks along the way.

boat tour~

     You are on a boat tour destined for Alcatraz.  The island
is barely visible from here due to the dense fog and mist.  The
waters of the bay are very choppy right now and the boat is being
thrown all over.  Better hang on for your pathetic little lives.
It would be best not to fall into these shark infested waters.

Docks~
     This is a huge shipyard.  There are cruise ships, tankers, tug boats,
small boats, yachts, etc.,.  Boats of all sizes come here.  There is a
small shop situated on the dock to the south.  It flies a flag that says
something about Alcatraz.  Maybe it is a tour guide service that furies
people to the remote island out in the bay.

     That giant car that is sticking out of the wall resembles the 
Famous Hard Rock Cafe.  Looks like it is undergoing allot of 
remodeling.  They do not seem to be open for business.  There 
is a large sign covering both front doors.

     Many people still crowd the streets.  There is an ABC store beside
you.  Lots of local bum's and whino's are begging outside.  Ding Ding

They don't stop for tourists.

Market Street~

     Lot's and lot's of stuff going on here.  Corner markets are
everywhere.  Seems everyone has something to sell, or somewhere
to go or something to do.  Must be noon lunch hour.  There is 
a Trolly Depot to the south of here.  It might be a tour guide as well.

     At the corner of 77th street and Market.  Even though this area

Golden Gate Bridge~

     On this side of the bridge is the wonderful town of San
Francisco.  It is a beautiful town built on the side of a mountain
overlooking the bay.  Trolly's roam the streets transporting
people to and fro.  Be sure and stop by the sourdough bakery.
The bread is wonderful.

Golden Gate Bridge~

     The Golden Gate Bridge is a spectacular engineering feat.
It towers way above the San Francisco bay.  Just think, people 
are actually crazy enough to jump from this thing, be it suicide,
or stupidity.

Steep trail~

     You encounter a steep trail which hugs the mountain.  It is covered
with debris, downed trees, and foliage.  Looks like a recent flood
swept over this area and caused a mud slide.
