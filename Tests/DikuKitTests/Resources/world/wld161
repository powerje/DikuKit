The Great White Bear's Den~
You have entered the den of the biggest Polar Bear you have ever seen.
He lies resting in his cozy dwelling, lying next to him is his most 
prized possesion, his Baby Bear. She is beautiful and he guards her
as she sleeps, cuddled close to him. He watches you closely as you 
approach. Oddly enough you feel safe here in his den and in your 
heart you know no harm will befall you.

The PermaFrost Forest~

     Looking around, you squint to peer into the trees but your vision
is useless in the pitch of the frozen woods. Ice falls to the ground
from ancient trees producing a dull but constant ringing. You find the
frigid darkness unnerving but you feel that you must press on.

The PermaFrost Forest~

     The trees creak from above as more fallen ice litters your path.
Thoughts of warmer days flood your mind. You find the absence of living
creatures particularly disturbing. A chilling breeze grips you and you 
shudder at the thought that you are the only life you can see.

The PermaFrost Forest~

     To the north the forest thins into vast expanses of frozen tundra.
The trees around you glisten with a hint of sunlight as you near the 
open land. While the vastness of the tundra promises more sunlight you
fear that you will no longer have the sylvan protection from the winds.

A Bear's Den~

     You have entered the dwelling of a large land mammal. Around you are
signs of occupancy but no signs of the owner. In a corner you see a large
pile of fur. " Now who could have left thier cloak here ? " You think to 
yourself. As you approach the fur it stirs slightly, awoken by your steps.
It rises slowly and before you stands the immense figure of an angry Polar
Bear.

As you enter the small cozy chamber you notice it is considerably warmer in
here than outside. You hear snoring coming from the back of the small cave.
As you approach, you startle and wake a mother bear and her cubs. She charges
you and defends her cubs to the death.

     As you near the coast and the ice flows you can see the steam
rising off the water into the crisp, dry air. You hear the sound of 
ice blocks scraping past each other in the flow. Just the sight of 
the icy depths chills your bones. " Be careful for thin ice ", you 
think to yourself.

Pack Ice~

     You are standing on the newly formed pack ice from the huge glacier.
The pack ice was formed when the falling chunks and sheets of ice crashed
into the sea. You feel the pack ice moving beneath you as it slowly drifts
out into the frigid ice blue waters of the north.

Dangerously Thin Ice~

     You have walked out onto the dangerously thin ice. The ice begins to 
crack and give way. You try desperately to make it back to the shore and 
safety, but it is to late. The ice seperates and the weight of your armor
pulls you into the deep dark waters. You sink deeper and deeper into the 
big, blue fathomless ocean to your death.

The Edge of the Arctic Sea~

     As you enter the shimmering blue waters you feel the numbing coldness
penetrate your clothes and chill you to the bone. The icy hand of death is
slowly crushing you as you swim out to sea. You think to yourself, " Only a 
polar bear colud survive this cold."

Ice Flow~

     You have reached an ice flow, a small haven for swimmers in these
arctic waters. Luckily you escaped the deathly cold waters just in the
nick of time to avoid hypothermia. You have beaten the sea for now, but
dont feel to confident for at anytime you could succumb to her icy charms.

Deep Blue Water~

     You are well below the surface now and the water here is very dark
and blue. The pressure is increasing as you swim downward to the very 
bottom of the ocean. Light slowly vanishes and the eerie silence makes
you anxious with fear. As you look around you see very little life at 
these great depths.

The Big Blue~

     You have descended well below the safe limits for people. Only the
denizens of the sea brave these depths for they are safe here. You feel
and hear sounds in the water all around you. Looming in the water before 
you is a shape so ominous and huge that you tremble in fear. Out of the 
blue depths swims the largest creature to ever inhabit this world, The
Blue Whale. You hear his beautiful but dangerous song.
