Outside Stately Ninja Manor.~
You are outside Stately Ninja Manor. You look up and notice how huge
this place is. This will be the place for this year's Northern 
Crossroads High School prom. There seems to be some sort of eerie air 
around and this place gives you the creeps. Outside you see limos pull
up and some of the kids going to the prom are waiting to get inside. Even
they don't seem normal.

How disgusting! The smell of putrid garbage floats through your nostrils

outside here that contain the smelly remains of what the occupants had for
dinner. These dumpsters don't seem quite normal either.

The Front Door of Stately Ninja Manor.~
The huge wooden door to the Statley Ninja Manor is opened up so students
attending the Northern Crossroads High School prom can come in. You try to get 
a closer look at what lurks inside the mansion, but a couple attending the
prom has different ideas. Even the car they pulled up in doesn't seem 
normal. It seems to be breathing flames out it's front, then it turns 
toward you. Who knew cars had fangs?

This place is awfully creepy. The lion statues that adorn the sides of
the stairway leading up look lifelike. At the top of the stairs you see
the entrance to the prom, the music from the band that's warming up for
this gig really blows. Good thing you didn't waste your money going
to this years prom, eh?

Up the Stairs.~
These stairs don't seem to hold your weight very well as they
seem to creak as you go up. You wonder if the caretaker of this
place will fix these damn stairs. A musty smell is in the air 
now, and it's kind of hard to imagine what is giving this`
smell off. It probably is coming from one of the students 
above. Maybe the cologne he's wearing is too cheap.

Aha! You are now upstairs. The hallway leading eastward is where the prom
is taking place, and the hallway leading west is where a Royal Elks lodge
meeting is being held. I really wouldn't go west if I was you. Last year's
annual meeting held here was really rowdy. A bunch of drunken men slugged
it out with police officers and a bunch of people died, so it might not
be such a good idea to head west.

in there are brawling like there's no tomorrow. Unfortunately, a few drunken
guys see you and start carrying you off to a corner. The rest of the Elks
decide to join in as they all beat you so bad your own mother won't recognize
you. The last thing you think about before blacking out is whether or not
you made out your will yet. Too bad. Have a nice day!

The entrance to the prom.~
You stand in front of the doorway to the prom. The music you
hear from inside is from the live band the school hired. The music
they are playing is awful. You smell something else inside that's 
rotten, possibly the food. The theme of this years prom is on top
of some banner, but it looks like it's scribbled on and you
can't read it. Some dude is standing in front of the door checking
for tickets. He looks like he's willing to block non students
from entering the prom.

How sweet! The spotlight dance of the night! This is the dance that `
spotlights the king and queen of this years prom. Too bad they look like 
total losers, huh? What kind of people voted for these two anyway? They
must now have any brains in their head.

What a crowd! You can barely see the dance floor that's to the north of you.
Some of the people are crowding your way, so maybe you oughtta try to push 
them out of the way. That's a job that's easier said than done.

You have finally reached the buffet table here at this years prom, and
boy doesn't that food look good? Well actually it looks kinda rotten.
Some of the food looks like it's burnt, and some of it looks so undercooked
it might even be alive! Stay away from the veal cutlets, too.

What a confusing sight this is. It's almost as you can get lost
inside this prom! It seems like it is a confusing maze, going back
to the same place you were before. Hopefully, you can find your way 
to the dance floor.

Some guy is standing here serving out different kinds of drinks. You
are dissapointed when you find out he doesn't serve any alcoholic 
beverages. You can sure go for some Jack Daniels right about now.
Roaming around a prom night can sure make one thirsty.

This is the spot in this room where the photographer is taking
pictures of these happy couples... Well not all of them are happy
anyway. This one couple there right now seems to be bickering back and 
forth amongst each other, and the cameraman is getting frustrated.
The cameraman seems to be getting ready to kill them so watch out!

What a bunch of geeks sitting at this table. All day long they talk about

talking about this great new mud he found over the internet! What a bunch of

Well over at this table, we have the pranksters. Look at them 
doing bad things to people just walking by. One of them even has
a bunch of fireworks in his pocket, and another one has a bottle
of scotch. Wonder if he's gonna spike the punch bowl??

playing througout the night. He sounds like a cat got stuck in his

here at the prom.

That drummer you see over here is pretty lousy, too. He looks like

terrible as well. These two need to go back to the garage and practice
some more.

Doesn't this guy match the description from that note? If you still
have that note, then you'd know what this room description means.
the guitarist sees you and looks like he's ready to get out
of Dodge, fast.
