{RED}The Begining{red}~
  
   {BLA,BO}Smoke fills the air here due to a tank that is
   burning and badly damaged. The air is thick with
   black smoke. It is very hard to breath. Every
   breath is toxic. Nothing but the burning tank and
   the billowing fire can be made out. The heat from
   the blaze is intense and overwhelming. There is 
   no way that breathing in this smoke and heat can 
   be healthy.{bla}

{RED,BO}Entering the battle{red}~

   {RED}A dense smoke covers the battlegrounds. Sounds of gunfire
   and explosions are all around. In the distance you can 
   hear commanders yelling orders to their troops. You can
   make out a trooper running through the smoke. You can
   see many different color flares burst through the sky. 
   Planes roar by the battlegrounds letting out spurts of
   gunfire. The sounds of heavy tanks racing through the
   battlegrounds and then letting out a loud boom is almost
   deafening. Slowly your unit makes way through the
   battle to find shelter from the killing.{red}

{YELL}Secret Meeting Area{yell}~

   {YELL}This area appears to be a secret meeting area.
   There is a small field table with a map on it
   that says {BLUE}COBRA{YELL} compound. Fresh boot prints in
   the dirt show that this area has been used 
   recently. A camouflage net has been put up to
   disguise the area from spying eyes. It looks
   as if someone was in a hurry here because the
   map and equipment was left behind.{yell}

  {GREEN,BO}The only thing here is a couple of cots and a small
  makeshift nightstand. The only way that you can tell
  this is a female room is by the objects lying on the
  nightstand. There is some makeup and shampoo on a shelf.
  On another shelf is a file hidden under clothing. The 
  file is labeled {RED}"TOP SECRET".{red}

   {BLA,BO}This room is hidden well from all the other 
   rooms. It appears to be a room that someone
   important could hide, in case of an attack.
   There is only a few essentials here: a sleeping 
   bag, food and water for one week, and a toilet.
   There is a little space lamp in the corner. There
   are no windows along the small room. In the ceiling
   can be seen an exhaust fan. It is probably there
