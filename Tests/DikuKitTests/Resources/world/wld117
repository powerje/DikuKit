The Millenary Forest Maze~


  You're standing on the branch of a huge  tree, 200'
  tall or more. The branch  is as  thick as a regular
  tree trunk.  Even taller trees surround yours.  The
  trees canopies touch one  another in  an  intricate
  aerial maze of branches and leaves.  The foliage is
  so thick that you can barely see a yard away.  It's
  impossible to see the  sky above,  even this  high. 
  The forest floor is 150' below you, lost in perpetu
  al darkness down there. A fall from here would be.. 
  ... your last one!

Service Door Behind the (<B>) Palace~


  You are behind the huge castle of <B>, in front  of
  a small door. All sort of old dancing paraphernalia
  litters the place.  They have obviously been discar
  ded by the dancers in the palace.  An aroma of beer
  and cigar smoke comes from inside.

  It is nice to have a neighbor with his own acetlyne

stats~


   You have 5 base stats for your char.  Strength, Intelligence,
Wisdom, Dexterity, and Constitution.
 
   Strength     - determines how much weight you can carry and how 
                  many items you can hold in inventory
   Intelligence - determines how fast you learn skills/spells when
                  you practice them
   Wisdom       - determines how many practice sessions you get
                  each time you level
   Dexterity    - helps to determine how succesful you are when
                  thief/warrior skills used
   Constitution - determines how many hit points you get each time
                  you level
 
   It is advised that you get all these abilities to 18 as soon as
possible.
 
~
E
equipment eq~


   It is a matter of good manners to adorn your body with the finest
equipment Northern Crossroads has to offer.  Each piece of equipment
is unique and offers a variety of benefits.  When outfitting oneself,
always have a full complement of eq.  Even if pieces are crappy, they
still provide some help.  At lower levels, look for equipment that
will increase your armour class and have spell like components such
as sanctuary and haste.  At higher levels, seek out items which
increase your damage and hitroll.  Always carry recall scrolls, and
have plenty of healing type potions in your inventory.
NOTE:: Mobs which breath will destroy equipment carried in inventory,
so keep your eq in containers, these are unharmed by breath.
 
~
E
shops shop~


   There are various shops about which provide goods and services.
Use 'list' to see what a shopkeeper has.  Below is a list of some
helpful ones:
 
   Blacksmith:  Keeps your eq in tip top shape.  'Offer all' to see
                the cost of repairs.  "Rep all' to fix 'emp up.
   Healer:      Sells a variety of potions; especially teals which heal.
   Alchemist:   Sells helpful potions including sanctuary. Olympus
                Alchemist has ambrosia which are nice healing potions.
   Mage Shop:   Sells detect invis potions and improved id scrolls.
   Armourer:    Buys and sells armor type eq.
   Weaponsmith: Buys and sells weapons.
 
~
E
levels level lvl~


   Of course one of the primary objectives in the mud is to seek
out experience and gain levels.  When you level, it is always best
to maximize all benefits derived from levelling.  That is, getting
the most pracs possible, the most hit points, and when training in
skills/spells, doing so with the least number of practices used.
The way to do this is to ensure that your WIS/CON are at 18 when
you level, and that your INT is at 18 when you practice.  There
are two ways to do this.  One, use your practices to train your
stats up at Bozo's.  The second is you outfit yourself with equip-
ment that raises your abilities.  Note, this equipment does not
have to be worn outside the times of levelling and training skills.
Note::  It does not hurt to equip your self with this 'levelling
equipment', even if your stats are already 18.
 
~
E
clerics cleric cle cler~


   Clerics are a strong class that possess both good hit points and
many defensive spells.  Some of these spells are listed below:
 
   Armor:        This spell increases your AC and is always wise to have.
   Bless:        Gives you a better chance of hitting mobs in battle.
   Blindness:    Mobs unable to cast spells at you and worse chance to hit.
   Dispel Magic: Removes spells from mobs/items.
   Guinness:     Definately the best spell on the mud.  A guinnessed
                 mobs chance of striking you is greatly reduced when drunk.
   Heal:         Cures up to 100hp in damage.
   Imp Bless:    You damage bonus is increased with this spell.
   Magical Vest: Lowers your AC by a significant amount.  Effectiveness
                 increases with level.
   Rune of Prot: Prevents aggresive mobs from attacking.  Some mobs are
                 anti-rune and will attack through this spell.
   Sanctuary:    Mobs do half damage to you when you are sanced. Priceless!
 
~
E
eat eating drink drinking~

   Like real life, you get hungry and thirsty on the mud.  Now
pay attention, it is not always a good idea to listen to your
bodies signals.  First off, there is only a certain amount
you can eat and drink.  If you eat or drink to capacity, then
you will not be able to do either until your desire returns.
Now, your rate of hit point, mana, and energy regain is linked
partly to your current level of hunger and thirst.  If these
desires are satisfied, you will refresh faster.  Here are two
reasons not to keep these desires always totally fulfilled: 
   1) If you are hasted and a spell wears out, your energy will
      drop to 0.  Eat to maximize your energy.
   2) Chocolate milk is a god send.  It regains your hit points
      and mana and will temporarily take them about max.  If
      you keep yourself continually hungry and thirsty, then
      you will be able to drink lots of choco when you need to
      recover quickly or go into battle with big hit points.

mob1 mobs1 m1~


   Since killing mobs is the only way to get XP and a good source
of gold and treasure, it is likely you will come to blows with them
more than a few times.  Heed the following advice:
 
   Spells: Some mobs are very tough and should be spelled up to
prevent them from killing you.  Use 'dispel magic' to get rid of
sanctuary, 'blindness' to lower their chance to hit and prevent them
from attacking the weak group members, 'guinness' is the best; it
makes it very hard for a mob to hit you (usually).
  However, when you spell a mob, the mob gives less experience!!!

~
E
mobs2 mob2 m2~


   Breath Weapons: Some mobs breath fire, lightning, gas, frost, and/
or acid.  All of these but acid will destroy equiment carried in your
inventory, so keep stuff in your containers (these cannot be harmed).
Acid is nasty, few mobs breath acid, it destroys the AC that comes
from your equipment.  Do not fight acid mobs with good equipment on.
 
   XP: There are caps on how much XP you get depending on your level.
Level whenever possible so that your cap goes up.  Mobs that are below
or equal to your level only give 1/2 XP, so seek out mobs stronger
than you (but not so strong they will kill you).
 
   Wimpy: Wimpy is a setting that allows you to flee from mobs when you
are hurt.  Wimpy is toggled on and off by typing wimpy alone.  To set
the level at which you want to flee, type: wimpy #.  The number is the
number of hitpoints at which you will attempt to flee.  Note that some
mobs are so tough, that you want to set your wimpy equal to your max hp.
 

~
E
mage mages mag~


   Well, here is the ugly truth.  Mages are by far the weakest class on
the mud.  They have poor hit points and most of their spells do not seem
to balance the character.  However, some of the better spells follow:
 
   Armor:        This spell increases your AC and is always wise to have.
   Blindness:    Mobs unable to cast spells at you and worse chance to hit.
   Blink:        Returns you to the spot marked.  Used with Mark.
   Detect Invis: Lets you see invisible mobs and items.
   Dispel Magic: Removes spells from mobs/items.
   Haste:        Speeds you up and gives you an extra attack each round.
   Infravision:  Allows you to see in the dark.
   Mark:         Marks a spot to be returned to later.  Used with Blink.
   Shield:       Reduces your AC.  Also handy.
   Solar Flare:  Causes high damage to those cast at.
   Visitation:   Allows you to go to players/mobs the same or lower level.
                 Anti-visit eq and some mobs block this spell.

E
ava avatar avatars~


   Avatars possess the skills of all classes.  A person becomes an
avatar by first reaching level 50/50 and then praying at the shrine
in Paladine.  All skills are reset once you avatar and will have to
be learned anew.  Fear not, avatars do not use practices for this.
Avatars learns skills/spells by failure.  Everytime you fail in an
attempt, you become more versed in that skill/spell.  Some skills
are easy to learn right away.  For example, just type peek e about
100 times, the skill should be learned to the best of your ability
after that.  Other skills just take time.  Levelling is different
for avatars too; levelling is done automatically when the XP point
is hit for the next level, so make sure your stats are all 18.
Beware, as an avatar you must watch your EGO points, if they drop
below 0 due to fleeing, you will lose 10 hp everytime you flee
after that.

war warrior warriors~


   High hit points and the following skills make warriors a good class.
 
   Block:    This prevents wimpy mobs from fleeing.  This skill
             remains active until toggled off.
   Dragon P: This has the chance to stun the mob for 3 rounds.
             Total failure causes you to fall down and you must
             then stand up before attempting another skill.
   Parry:    You are able to parry the mobs attacks with this.  A
             message reading 'back to the attack' means you are no
             longer parrying and must reapply the skill.
   Pummel:   Succesfully applied, this will stun the mob for the
             next attack round.  Complete failure will cause you
             to lose two rounds of attack, or, if you are assisting
             someone, will cause you to drop out of the fight.
   Rescue:   Removes the person being attacked from the fight and
             makes you the primary target.

thi thief thieves~


   Thieves possess many excellent skills which are outlined below:
 
   Backstab: This causes a great amount of damage to the mob and has
             a chance of stunning it for 3 rounds.  No matter what,
             you will be unable to take any action for 3 rounds.
   Block:    This prevents wimpy mobs from fleeing.  This skill remains
             active until toggled off.
   Circle:   Apply this skill during a fight and you will do damage
             to the mob.  You also have a chance of stunning the mob.
   Peek:     One of the best skills.  Allows you to see into the next
             room.  When it says 'You get a bad feeling..', this is a DT!
   Sneak:    This allows you to slip through the shadows without players
             or mobs being aware of your presence.  The spell 'sence life'
             counters this ability.

   Also known as the "Maximum Strength Quest". It is a quest
   to take your natural strength to your racial maximum. The
   strength of a character has two parts, the first one  can
   be trained at Bozo (up to 18 for humans), the second part
   can be raised, normally, only by 'strength' spells and on
   a temporary basis.  However, if you complete  this  quest
   successfully, your second part will be permanently at its
   maximum.

   The normal mobs are suited for small groups of level 20-25 with
lots of potions.  The head mobs require groups of levels 40+ with
spells and potions.  The eq to be had are mainly +3 so it is a good
place to go to gather club eq.  
From Mk[],6e,5n,w.  Kill customers for XP, to get behind the counter,
work your way north and west.  The mobs behind the counter are tougher
and require some prudence.  To get to playland, find the head manager,
kill him and take his keys.  Toyland is mid south in the dining room.
Enter the toy and find your way to the top.  The brats along the way
carry 500K coin.  Grimace is here too and has a nice skin.  Kill the
kid at the top with the key.  Go back down and head towards the toilets.
Kill the birthday boy and take his toy.  North of him use the key to
gain access to the basement.  Down there you will find ronald with
his wig and the big boss with the cigar.  In one of the bathrooms there
is also the toilet paper collar. --> Shroud <--

This area would be best suited for levels 20-30 to run.
From Mk[],6e,3n,2w,5n,3e,5s,3e,3u,n.
This gets you to the town of Olympus.   Available here for purchase
are nectar and ambrosia potions from the alchemist.  There are
several 'good' items including flaming gauntlets, glowing shield,
and blue robe.  The zone itself is pretty straight forward and does
not contain any DT's.  Things to be wary of include Ra, who casts
powerful spells, and the war hounds, which are very aggressive and
breath lightning (they carry a fair amount of cash).  Hounds are
worth approximately 5 mil exp but their breath can destroy eq.

This is a zone that provides both good experience and eq.  The pigs and
menehune give good cash (700k-1 mil) and you can also get menehune waters
which are triple heal.  For good eq there is the Ali'i Crown, Minor Collar
of Magic, and Collosal Spear of the Ancients.
From Mk[],s,3e,2s,2w,4s,e,n,2e,2n,3u,n,d,n.  From this point just go north
to kill pigs and menehune (and Mynah), but if you are going for eq then hunt
guard and this should take you to the guard for Ali' crown.  I suggest you
be at least level 40+ to fight him solo, and first spell him up. Open door
and go south.  Dispel, guinness, (and maybe blind) Ali'i chief and have a
ball. For minor collar ... from entrance go all n,w,all n,e,3n,2w,all n,w.
Spell up the guard if you are about lvl 40... and depending on your eq...
(con him to be sure).. open and go south. Spell up the Kahunas and have a
ball.  Soloing these mobs for players below 40+ is not advised.

Now go 2u. Here is the King and his guards.  Blind the guards and then
kill them one by one.  Now dispel, blind, and guinness the king and kill
him for the spear.  This part is for groups of atleast 3 mid level avatars.

From m[] s,3e,2s,2w,8s,2e,7s  which will land you on the beach.  
Lots of native warriors to kill for  midlevel  characters, with 
good xp (lvl 20-30).
From there:  3s,w,2s,e,s,3e will get you to the entrance of the 
Camp. In the camp you can go to:
* The Howells:  swsws
* Skipper and Gilligan: 3sws2w (gilligans hat,shirt and boots).
* Professor: s2es2es (professors glasses)
* Giner and Mary Anne: s2esese2ses  (Gingers dress)
All the mobs give good xp, mr Howell carries 2mil in coins.
I'd suggest  level 30 and up for these mobs  and bring  lots of 
teals.  They do hit hard (if they hit :)
Also,  you can go visit the cave and the warrior chief. No good 
equip.

artic circle~


For groups of levels 35-40 (or avatars) before  trying  it.  It 
may be soloed by high hp avatars. From Mk[],s,3e,2s,10w,s,3u,s,
2w,s,2w,n,2w,n,e,3n,w,n.  At the landing go w,n and you will be 
in the Arctic Circle(Permafrost Forest). Eq includes Owl Wings, 
Polar Bear Gauntlets,  Whalebone  Plate, Walrus Tooth, and some 
other good stuff.  The  cold  causes you to lose about 1 hp per 
shiver so you need good hp or mana for healing.  Blue whale has 
whalebone plate, and he is hard...Polar bears are somewhat hard 
because the mob hunts you.  So have backup and rescue a lot.  
There are no dt's that I know off, so when you get  to zone you 
can just hunt the mob with the eq you want.   The mobs are sca-
vengers and will loot your corpse if you die, so do not die.  
Going after the blue  whale  you must go under water.  This will 
cause you to lose 15 hp every breath and  magic does not work in 
the whale's room, so be cautious here. Gate demons and hunt them.

hell~


Hey guys I have provided you with these directions to hell:
Start at Market Square go: 14e,3n,2e,2n,w,2n,u,4w,4n,
7e,2s,3e,3s,3w,3u,4e,6n,4w,3s,4e, Open Rock, n,4d,e,3d,s,2e,3s,3w,
2s,e,d,3e,2n,e,d,e (**SPELL UP HERE...RUNE OF PROTECTION PROT. EVIL, ETC**)
one east leads to the Hell Guardian blocking the Great Door to Hell. As
far as i know there is no DT's in this area, unless you not flying in the
great sea on the way to the leviathon mob.  So when in the Great Sea cast
fly upon yourself to save youself any hassle.  These mobs are tough.  The
recommended group is 3 to 6 avatars.  Good luck and have fun.  There is
some good eq to be won.

x1 xmansion1 mansion1 x-mansion1~


From Mk[]: 21e u gets you to the edge of the forest.
Reavers and Sentinels are blocking mobs and if they're in the same
room will have to be killed to get past.  Good xp for their toughness
so if you want to level quickly (as avatar) I like 'm better than 
zombies.
The area has some decent midlevel equipment and the avatar part has
magnetos cape, which is comparable to belldandy but much easier to get.
From the edge of the forest go 2e,2n,e,2n,s,e to the entrance of the mansion.
Open gate.  In the mansion the friends of humanity are agg, but not through 
rune.
To get to avatar area: 2n open entrance n w s and kill xavier, open underground
then d,3e,n kill forge, open simulator and go e.
Simulator 1 has Mastermold and his armor, the sentinels assist and are
different from the sentinels outside mansion.
 
~
E
x2 xmansion2 x-mansion2 mansion2~


Simulator 2 has Magneto and 5 acolytes, same story as sentinels. Blind them!
The way to fight Mastermold and Magneto is to pummel them and flee to a
magic room, calm and then spell 'm up.
Simulator 3 has war,pestilence,famine,death and the tough one, Apocalypse.
war, pestilence, famine, and death do not assist and can be dealt with
seperately.
Apocalypse is tough, need a big group of avatars, try to lure him to a magic
room. There's 2 no magic rooms there, but he hunts.  4-5 avatars should be
able to kill him I think.
Rest of mansion is mid-level and can be soloed by an avatar, group up if
you're not avatars.  Its pretty straightforward and the equip that can
be found is, among other things, beasts backpack, Storms badge, X-belt,
Gambits Ace ('card' is keyword), cyclops visor, wolverine claws.
I think its a pretty good area with decent equip for the mobs that are
there.
 
           Have fun!  Sloth/Vapor

Jobu's Club Main Board~



  Tired as you are, you walk into this room. Echos of
  the past linger in the walls. Paintings of <B> hero
  of the Age of Dreams, Jobu, whose  legendary  grace
  and rythm turned deadly in battle, a true dancer of
  the sword.  The club board stands in the center of
  the room, read it and write on it too.

LXXVII~


               The nightingale has a lyre of gold,
                  The lark's is a clarion call,
               And the blackbird plays but a boxwood flute,
                  But I love her best of all.
...
               For her song is all the joy of life,
                  And we in the mad spring weather,
               We too have listened till she sang
                  Our hearts and lips together.

Byron's Love Poem : She Walks In Beauty~


               SHE walks in beauty, like the night
                  Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
               And all that's best of dark and bright
                  Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
               Thus mellowed to that tender light
                  Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
...
               One shade the more, one ray the less,
                  Had half impaired thy nameless grace,
               Which waves in every raven tress,
                  Or softly lightens o'er her face;
               Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
                   How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
...
                And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
                  So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
               The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
                  But tell of days in goodness spent,
               A mind at peace with all below,

Byron's Love Poem : So We'll Go No More A Roving~


               So we'll go no more a-roving
                  So late into the night,
               Though the heart be still as loving,
                  And the moon be still as bright.
               For the sword outwears its sheath,
                  And the soul wears out the breast,
               And the heart must pause to breath,
                  And love itself have rest.
...
               Though the night was made for loving,
                  And the day returns too soon,
               Yet we'll go no more a-roving
                  By the light of the moon.

{BLUE,BOLD}({WHITE,BOLD}<{RED,BOLD}B{WHITE,BOLD}>{BLUE,BOLD}) {YELLOW,BOLD}Tyger{WHITE,BOLD}'s Suite No. 101{g}~

  You have walked into a spacious room with glowing
  white marble floors. A spacious jacuzzi is nestled
  into the northwest corner of the room. The eastern
  walls contains a gigantic fireplace. A queen-size
  iron bed rests against the western wall. An immense
  set of windows looking out over Midgaard immediately
  catches your eyes. Different pieces of armor and 
  finery are strewn about the sitting area of the
  apartment. Lanval and Revenge seem content in their
  love nest.

fireplace~

  A fire is roaring in the fireplace. The snapping
  and crackling logs cast a friendly glow on the
  room's marble floors.

~
E
jacuzzi tub~

  Steam rises from the jacuzzi. Rose petals scent
  the bubbling waters. Candles line the edges of
  the tub.

~
E
sitting area~

  A fluffy stuffed loveseat, couch, glider rocker, and
  set of recliners are arranged to form a cozy place for
  Lanval and Revenge to chat with their guests.

~
E
bed iron~
  
  The bed is made of a dark iron substance. It
  features dragons with eyes of moonstone. The
  eyes seem to glow. Perhaps this is only the
  result of the reflection of the fire in the
  fireplace.

~
E
windows set~

  These windows practically cover the expanse 
  of the wall. At night, Lanval and Revenge can
  often be found in one another's arms in front
  of the windows, wishing on stars and planning
  their life together. During the day, the two
  often watch the sun gradually illuminate the
  city of Midgaard below as they cuddle in bed.

   {BLACK}{BOLD}As you ener the room, the air grows chill.
   Your eyes dilate as they strain to see a
   shadow approach in this pitch black room.
   There is a flash of light and suddenly,
   the wall displays the words...
        "Death is watching"
   written in {RED}b{RED}{BOLD}l{bold}{RED}o{RED}{BOLD}o{bold}{RED}d{BLACK}{BOLD}. The lights fade, and you
   are again left in complete, utter darkness.
   
   Somehow, you don't feel very alone.

  red with luxurious gold-embroidered comforters. At

  be seen.  The closet is large enough to accomodate

  This room is WILD! The scent of fast food
  permeates the entire area. Looking up, you
  see rows of cheeseburgers that apparently
  form the room's ceiling. The walls are made
  of...FRENCH FRIES!?! When you look at the
  two king size beds, the first thing that 
  pops into your mind is apple pie. A glance
  at the sitting area shows you a couch that
  is actually made of an enormous packet of
  ketchup! What kind of FREAKs would live in 
  a place like this? Newbified and Newblified!

couch ketchup packet~

  The couch is actually a HUGE packet of ketchup. When
  you sit on it, it feels like a cross between a waterbed
  and a bean bag. It's actually quite comfortable to sink 
  into after a long day of fighting.

~
E
ceiling burgers cheese cheeseburgers burger cheeseburger~

  You look up to see row upon row of yummy cheeseburgers
  forming the ceiling of the room. Each cheeseburger has 
  mustard, pickles, onions, and ketchup on it. A ladder
  with tiny wheels sits in a corner of the room. All you
  need to do is climb up to grab lunch!

~
E
wall walls french fries~

  The walls are actually made of french fries! It seems
  that there is some weird machine that actually restocks
  the walls after the fries get cold or someone eats them.
  You find yourself hungry for a handful of golden french
  fries.
~
E
bed apple pie~

  Wow! The bed is shaped like an apple pie! It's a nice
  golden brown color, and a scent of cinammon comes from
  the sheets and comforter that adorn it. Just looking at
  it makes you hungry.

   leaves a ring in the dust from where it sat. A heart has been

Noisy's Sound System~


  Finally you have found the source of all the insane
  ly loud techno, disco,  and  bass  rythms that have 
  echoed all through the club house. Near the wall, a 
  set of four enourmous speakers units, powerful amp-
  lifiers vibrates at the deafening rythm. A state of
  art sound console includes: a double turntable, ca-
  ssette and CD player.  The volume controls seem wel
  ded in the full blast position.  No hope of it get-
  ting any quieter here!

  The floor is made of black marble that gleams from
  the light of the fireplace. A king size bed made of
  some dark stone graces the west wall. The fireplace,
  also made of dark stone, is recessed into the east
  wall. A row of windows along the north wall gives
  a bird's eye view of the compound's inner courtyard.
  The center of the room contains a table and chairs
  of black lacquer wood with ornate gold scrollwork. 
  A door leads from this room into another room where
  Rhythm chooses to sleep. You notice a plaque above
  the bed.

{BLU,BO}({W}<{R}B{W}>{BLU}){blu,bo} {W,BO}Blackhand's Suite No. 209{w,bo}~


  This room seems more like the  presidential  suite 
  of a five star hotel. Two king-size beds are cove-
  red with luxurious gold-embroidered comforters. At
  the side, a large wall case shows a  rich  variety  
  of vintage wine.  Single malt Scotch  bottles  can
  be seen.  The closet is large enough to accomodate
  your weapons and armor.

The Millenary Forest Maze~


  You're standing on the branch of a huge  tree, 200'
  tall or more. The branch  is as  thick as a regular
  tree trunk.  Even taller trees surround yours.  The
  trees canopies touch one  another in  an  intricate
  aerial maze of branches and leaves.  The foliage is
  so thick that you can barely see a yard away.  It's
  impossible to see the  sky above,  even this  high. 
  The forest floor is 150' below you, lost in perpetu
  al darkness down there. A fall from here would be.. 
  ... your last one!

{BO,W}Club {BLU}({W}<{R}B{W}>{BLU}) {W}Hotel Lobby{bo}~

   Many comfortable-looking beds lie on the opposite
   end of the room and the decor is stunning. You see
   the receptionist sitting at her desk with a small
   bouquet of roses in front of her. The receptionist
   flashes you a warm smile and says to you:

   "Thank you for choosing {BO,W}Club {BLU}({W}<{R}B{W}>{BLU}){bo}.
    Please enjoy your stay."
