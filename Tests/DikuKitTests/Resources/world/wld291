{C}Along The Thermodon River{c}~
{C}
   The Thermodon River directly to the west flows sluggishly
   here, near its mouth. A short distance to the north, it
   will empty into the Black Sea. The land here is well-fed
   by its waters, and lush green fields and forests abound.
   Many spectacular horses, alone or in packs, roam the land
   freely.

{Y}A Trampled Path{y}~

   The knee-high grass that grows here has been trampled down
   to bare dirt in places, forming a well-defined path that
   leads away from the eastern bank of the Thermodon. The
   large patches of brown among the dark green grass are proof
   that the path is used quite often. There is a dense forest
   in the valley to the south.

{BO,BL}Entrance To Themiscyra{bo,bl}~
{BO,BL}
   Two age-darkened wooden gates bar entrance into the city of
   Themiscrya. Sharp metal spikes protrude from the sturdy
   wood, darkened further by trails of dried blood. The tips of
   numerous arrows poke through crescent-shaped holes in the
   stone blocks forming the city's walls. A look to the top of
   the gates shows a stone battlement, also lined by archers.

   Surprising, considering his sturdy and well-crafted wares
   would be quite welcome in other markets. He should have

{G}An Overgrown Forest{g}~
{GR}
   This is an old-growth forest, with trees rising so high it
   is impossible to see the treetops. There are no discernible
   paths through the forest. Even worse, the canopy blocks out
   the sunlight and any view of landmarks. The trunks of these
   trees are often so thick that they block progress in certain
   directions.

{BO,W}A Circular Courtyard{bo,w}~
{BO,W}
   The forest to the north gives way to a beautifully designed
   circular courtyard, which lies in front of a crescent-shaped
   building. A marble statue of Artemis sits in the middle of
   the courtyard. Surrounding the statue are four distinct
   gardens, each more beautiful than the last. Stone benches
   line the gardens and are shaded by trellises covered by
   flowering vines.

{BO,W}The Temple of Artemis{bo,w}~
{BO,W}
   Wide, gradual steps lead up to the Temple of Artemis. The
   crescent-shaped building is a white so pure that it gleams,
   as befits the virgin goddess. Ionic columns define the edge
   of the first level, which is an open-air walkway that
   encircles half of the courtyard. A balcony juts out over
   the courtyard from the second level of the temple.

{BO,W}
   An archway to the north separates the open-air walkway and
   the enclosed part of the temple dedicated to the patron
   goddess of the Amazons. Niches in the walls hold white
   marble statues: most of Artemis, some of stags, others of
   objects or animals sacred to her. Another archway to the
   south leads to the inner sanctum of the temple.

{BO,W}The Inner Sanctum{bo,w}~
{BO,W}
   The inner sanctum of the temple is a circular atrium about
   five paces wide. A round opening in the vaulted ceiling
   allows moonlight to shine upon the 25-foot tall statue of
   Artemis in the center of the room. Sacrifices to the
   goddess can be placed at a small altar at her feet. A
   walkway encircles the atrium and leads to the balcony.

{W}A Small Stairway{w}~
{W}
   Behind the wall of the sanctum, a set of stone steps leads
   up to the second level of the temple. The stairway is not
   well-lit, but there should be enough light for one to find
   his way if he chooses his steps carefully. The door that
   hides these stairs is to the north.

{BO,W}The Walkway{bo,w}~
{B,W}
   The tiled walkway encircles the atrium of the inner sanctum.
   The balustrade, like most of rest of the temple, is made of
   gleaming white marble. Locked doors lead to the rest of the
   temple, but it is highly unlikely that an uninitiated will
   be able to gain access to the secret roooms. An archway to
   the north leads to the balcony.

{BO,W}The Balcony{b,w}~
{BO,W}
   Here, one has a great view of the circular courtyard below
   and even some ways into the surrounding forest. Celestial
   patterns have been carved in the floor and the walls behind
   the balcony. This balcony, which has no railing, is often
   used by the high priestess to address her acolytes.
