The Executive Office~
{BLACK}
   As you enter this room the large stone doors swing silently shut 
   behind you.  As you glance about in the dim light you see a 
   large ebony table surrounded with  several soft leather chairs.  
   The room is huge and extends into the horizon.  The walls on 
   either side are shelved with more books than you have ever seen.  
   The  bookshelves extend high into the rafters and walkways 
   extend away at each level.  There are two large gargoyles 
   perched precariously above either side of the stone door.

{RED}The Glimmering Isle of Melnibone{red}~
{RED}
   On the island kingdom of Melnibone all the old rituals are still 
   observed,  though the nations power has waned for five 
   hundred years, and now her way of life is maintained only by 
   her trade with the Young Kingdoms and the fact that the city 
   of Imrryr has become the meeting place of merchants.  Are 
   those rituals no longer useful?  Can the rituals be denied and 
   doom avoided?  One who would rule in emperor Elric's stead 
   prefers to think not.  He says that Elric will bring destruction 
   to Melnibone by his refusal to honor all the rituals.  And now 
   opens the tragedy which will close many years from now and 
   precipitate the destruction of this world.

{BOLD}{BLACK}The Bane of the Black Sword{bold}{black}~
{CYAN}
   Elric, having narrowly missed his chance for vengeance, left 
   the Eternal City and began his search anew.  Many years have 
   passed now since the sacking of Imrryr at his own hands.  
   Elric, proud and disdainful in his knowledge that even his 
   deficient blood was the blood of the Sorcerer Kings of 
   Melnibone, became detached.  He had no loyalties, nor 
   friends, and if evil possessed him, it was a pure brilliant evil, 
   untainted by human drivings.

   You follow a deep forest path not far from Bakshaan.  It has 
   been  rumored that the sorcerer of Pan Tang, Theleb K'aarna, 
   has put up residence there.  The forest path meanders softly 
   through the lushly vegetated flora and the ground is still moist 
   from the falling of the morning rain.  It is sad that there is 
   such foul work to be done, and you are quite sure it is not to 
   be taken on lightly by the weak of  heart.

{BLUE}The Sailor on the Seas of Fate{blue}~
{CYAN}
   And leaving his cousin Yrkoon sitting as regent upon the 
   Ruby Throne of Melnibone, Elric sailed from Imrryr, the 
   Dreaming City, and went to seek an unknown goal in the 
   worlds of the Young Kingdoms where Meniboneans were, at 
   best, disliked.

   Perhaps if you follow his meandering path you will find him, 
   maby then will you begin to find answers.  Here a ship is 
   docked.  Its design baroque and unfamiliar, with high decks 
   fore and aft, and no evidence or rowing ports.  The mist eddies 
   and more of the red light pours through to illuminate the 
   vessel, revealing the large wheels on both the foredeck and the 
   rear deck, the slender mast with its furled sails, the 
   complicated geometrical carvings of its rails and its figure 
   head, the great, curving prow which gives the ship an 
   impression of power and strength and makes you think that 
   this must be a warship.

{WHITE}The Weird of the White Wolf{white}~
{CYAN}
   You frantically walk along a peaceful valley path. At any 
   other time you might have enjoyed this little jaunt through 
   nature, but today your thoughts are heavy with a great burden. 
   The knowledge that it is up to you to maintain that ever fragile 
   balance between Law and Chaos. Through your travels you 
   have discovered that the balance is dangerously close to 
   tipping toward the side of Law. You know that there can only 
   be one cause. The one known as the Dark Lady Myshella, 
   Goddess of Law must be behind it. You have to find her and 
   stop her before the entire balance of the universe tips toward 
   Law. An unbalancing that would eventually cause its complete 
   destruction.

{MAGENTA}The Vanishing Tower{magenta}~
{CYAN}
   Elric plunged the Black Sword down the demon's stinking 
   throat, wrenching the blade so that it split jaw, neck, chest and 
   groin and the creature's life force began to course along the 
   length of the runesword.  The claws lashed out at him, but the 
   creature was weakening.

   Then the life force pulsed up the blade and reached Elric who 
   gasped and screamed in dark ecstasy as the demon's energy 
   poured into him.  He withdrew the blade and hacked and 
   hacked at the body and still the life force flowed into
   him.  The demon groaned and dropped to the flagstones.

   And it was done ....

   And then did Elric leave Jharkor in pursuit of Theleb K'aarna, 
   the sorcerer who had, so Elric claimed, caused him some 
   inconvenience ...

{BOLD}{BLACK}Stormbringer{bold}{black}~
{CYAN}
   There came a time when there was a great movement upon the
   Earth and above it, when the destiny of Men and Gods was
   hammered out upon the forge of fate, when monstrous wars were
   brewed and mighty deeds were designed.  And there rose up in this
   time heroes.  Greatest of these heroes was a doom driven
   adventurer who bore a crooning rune blade that he loathed.

   His name was Elric of Melnibone, king of the ruins, lord of a
   scattered race that had once ruled the ancient world.  Elric, who
   holds the fate of the Universe in his hands, will undo all that has
   been done.  He is in the hands of Fate.  You are the only hope for
   all the worlds.  

   You must stop him.

{BLUE}On the Ship that Sails Between Worlds{blue}~

   You are standing on the main deck of the ship.  There is a 
   dark mist that envelops it and the shore is barely discernable.  
   You sense that the mist has at some point become a part of the 
   ship and it follows you as you sail through the seemingly 
   murky sea.  There is a cabin built into the aft deck, while the 
   decks themselves rise up below the billowing sails.  There is a 
   ladder that leads to the rear of the ship.

   As you step up onto the fore deck of this aged vessel you can 
   hear the ship quietly moan as the waves of the sea push 
   against the sides of the hull.  You notice that the ship is 
   impossibly old and the wood seems to have seen a thousand 
   storms at sea.  There is a large figurehead, of which, you can 
   see only a portion of.  Looking over the prow you can see 
   through the thick mist to the horizon, and you think this quite 
   odd.

   can see outside of the ship.  There is a large heavy wooden
   bed and several large storage cabinets dispersed throughout 
   the room.  In addition you see a large ancient looking rug 
   which is painstakingly detailed in its depiction of what appear 
   to be dragons mounted with riders.

{BLUE}The High Aft Deck{blue}~
{CYAN}
   Since you have been aboard this vessel the sea and the 
   perpetual mist have had much to say.  Of the lost Emperor of 
   Melnibone, of the whereabouts of the runesword 
   Stormbringer, and of the forgotten city of Tanelorn.... the 
   ruins of Tenelorn.  The ancient city of Tenelorn, now home of 
   the beings Agak and Gagak.  The mist tells you that the ruins 
   are to be found upon an island.  And that upon this island, at 
   the heart of the ruins is to be found one whole building.   It is 
   this building which the dread two use.  It is that which you 
   must attack, and slay the pair and their servants.

   You feel the ship sway slightly and perhaps feel the coming of 
   the storm.  In the center of the deck there is a large wheel,  
   which, with the guidance of the mist may lead you to 
   Tanelorn... and the home of the pair.

{BLUE}A Deserted Island Shore{blue}~
{CYAN}
   As the mist clears a landscape of dense shadows is revealed.  
   The shadows spread over red rock and yellow vegetation, and 
   they are shadows of all shapes and dimensions, resembling all 
   manner of things.  They seem cast by the huge blood colored 
   sun which stands at perpetual noon above the island, but what 
   is disturbing about them is that the shadows themselves seem 
   without a source, as if the objects they represent are invisible 
   or existed elsewhere than on the island itself.  They sky, too, 
   seems full of these shadows, but whereas those on the island 
   were still, those in the sky sometimes move, perhaps when  
   the clouds  move.  and all the while the red sun pours down its 
   bloody light and touches you with its unwelcome radiance just 
   as it touches the land.

   At times, as you advance cautiously inland, a peculiar 
   flickering light sometimes crosses the island so that the 
   outlines of the place become unsteady before returning to 
   focus.  It could be that these are shadows cast by objects 
   existing in other dimensions.  Perhaps this is Tenelorn, or, 
   rather, all the versions of Tanelorn there have ever been.  For 
   Tanelorn exists in many forms, each form depending upon the

   At last you approach the likely center of Tanelorn and here is 
   a building which is not ruined.  It stands in a cleared space, all 
   curves and ribbons of metal and glowing tubes.  As you look 
   carefully at the building you can see that it is in fact two 
   buildings... both absolutely identical and joined at various 
   points by curling systems of pipes which might be connecting 
   corridors, though it is difficult to imagine what manner of 
   being might utilize them.  There is no cover to speak of and 
   you can see a point near the ground where a black opening of
   irregular proportions can be discerned.  The buildings pulse 
   and glow and occasionally whisper, but that is all.

   You and your party are the first to enter here.  You find

   squeeze your bodies through, sometimes they widen into what 
   are almost halls.  Most of the time, however, it seems that you 
   are climbing higher into the building.  As you press forward 
   you begin to feel a great sense of uneasiness and you can feel 
   the evil that lurks in the rooms ahead.

{BLUE}Gagak's Sanctuary{blue}~

   This place is octagonal and each of its eight sloping sides are 
   of a different color and each color changes constantly.  
   Occasionally the walls become semitransparent, revealing a 
   complete view of the ruined city far below, and also a view of 
   the twin castle to this one, still connected by tubes and wires.  
   It is the large pool in the center of the room which attracts 
   your attention most.  It seems deep and is full of evil-smelling, 
   viscous stuff.  It bubbles.  Shapes form in it.  Grotesque and 
   strange, beautiful and familiar, the shapes seem always upon 
   the brink of taking a permanent form before falling back into 
   the stuff of the pool.  And the voice is still louder and there is 
   no question that it comes from the pool.    "What? What? Who 
   invades ?!"

   Agak has awakened too late, but he is awakening at last,

   overwhelmed, whose eye you now use and whose powers you
   now attempt to utilize.

   But Agak now realizing his danger now begins to draw the
   energy of the universe into himself.  No longer would this be a
   pleasurable ritual shared with his sister.  He must draw at the
   energy of this universe if he were to find the strength to defend
   himself, to gain what he needs to destroy his attackers, the
   slayers of his sister.  Worlds die as Agak drains them.

   Phew, you have finally made it out of that accursed sea of chaos. 
   It takes you a few moments to reattune yourself to reality. Once 
   you have cleared your head, you look around and find yourself in 
   a wondrous cavern hewn from solid black obsidian. You wander 
   around a bit glad to be in somewhat familiar surroundings when 
   you come upon a set of huge double doors. When you walk up to 
   examine them closer they slowly creak open with the sound of 
   rock on rock. It is then that you remember why it is that you have 
   come. However,  it seems that you are expected ....

   move on knowing that you must succeed. Your only hope is that 
   whatever you encounter will be somewhat friendly.

   form in them and before you can turn to escape, several of them 
   reach through the wall and grab at you.

{WHITE}The Great Hall{white}~
{CYAN}
   You have entered what seems to be a main hall of some kind. 
   With high vaulted ceilings and a myriad of tapestries adorning the 
   wall, this room would not be out of place in any castle. The only 
   difference might be that the walls instead of being made from 
   granite block are carved from the same black obsidian that you've 
   seen all over. This room also seems to double as some kind of 
   study for there are several desks in the center with an abundance 
   of magical tomes and scrolls littering them. You pick one of the 
   books up and try to read it, but the language is nothing like you 
   have ever read before. It doesn't even seem familiar. It is then that 
   you wonder just how old this place is to be created before what is 
   now known in the world.

The gate before you is made from the shadows that seem to dance around the room.
When you try to peek through the gate the shadows solidify making a seemingly
translucent gateway turn into a very solid door. You only hope is that there is
a key of some kind that can open it.

   your way earlier are forming into what can only be a set of stairs. 
   You hesitantly step on one and are surprised that it feels very 
   solid. As you test a couple more of them you see that the shadows 
   shift, disappearing below you and reappearing above you so that 
   you can continue upward.

   You are standing in a room that looks like it is used for 
   entertaining.  There are many stunning tapestries hanging on the 
   wall, each depicting a noble looking man dressed in some sort of 
   armor. Several of them appear to have been kings by the look of 
   the adornments they wear.  Myshella must be close, you can just 
   feel it. Just as you about to see what else might be around, you 
   see a faint glow coming from the wall to the east. After a few 
   moments a doorway appears beckoning you to enter.

   You have entered an ornately decorated bedroom. The 
   furnishings all look like intricately carved mahogany, each one a 
   unique piece of art. The room is littered with all manner of statues 
   and vases all carved from solid obsidian and jade.  Your eyes 
   wander over to the corner of the room where looking out of a 
   picturesque window is the most beautiful woman you have ever 
   seen. She is gazing longingly out over the churning sea of chaos 
   below. She looks toward you as if you were a guest

   Just as you are about to examine more of the room you notice that
   there is a hairline crack next to one of the gargoyle figures. Peering
   at the area more closely you think there may be a chamber beyond.
   You try to move the block but to no avail. Searching around you
   see that the mouth of the gargoyle is opened into the shape of a
   gem. Could this be a keyhole of some sort...

   You open the panel in the mosaic and peer around to find that you 
   have discovered what appears to be the Dark Lady's private 
   sanctuary. The room is made from the purest obsidian stone that 
   you have ever seen. What peaks your interest more are the veins 
   of solid gold streaking throughout the stone. There is also a 
   pedestal in the center of the room surrounded by the bones of 
   many creatures long dead and some not so long dead. You can 
   only imagine what torments must have been inflicted on these 
   poor souls unfortunate enough to have become her play things. It 
   makes you feel at ease to know that there will be no more 
   additions to this gruesome collection.

{MAGENTA}Inside the Labyrinth{magenta}~

   Elric pursued Theleb K'aarna across the planes of the Sighing 
   Desert to the city of beggars, Nadsokor, in search of the stolen 
   Ring of Kings.  Urish, King of Nadsokor, having overwhelmed 
   Elric and imprisoned him in the labyrinth built ages ago beneath 
   the nearly ruined city to be consumed by the Burning God 
   imprisoned here by the Lords of Law.

   The stones of the halls seem oddly hot to the touch.  You stumble 
   back and notice the Portal you must have come through to be in 
   here.  The peculiar stuff still shimmers there.  You press your 
   hand against it and it gives reluctantly but then holds firm.  It is 
   like a particularly tough membrane but is not flesh.  Was this the 
   stuff with which the Lords of Law had sealed off the tunnel, 
   entrapping their enemy the Lord of Chaos?  The only light in the 
   tunnel comes from the membrane itself.

   You press further into the labyrinth, taking a hundred twists and 
   turns in the darkness before you pause again.  You have noticed 
   that it has become warmer.  It feels uncomfortably hot.

   Another turn and you see light ahead.

   You begin to run towards the source of the light.  But it is not 
   daylight, neither is it light from the portal.  This is firelight.... of 
   brands perhaps.  The source of the heat is around the next bend.  
   But the heat has grown greater and your flesh stings as the sweat 
   springs from your pours.

   A great voice suddenly fills the tunnel as you round the last bend 
   and you see the fire leaping not thirty yards distant.

   AAH! AT LAST!

   now lights the place, but it is deserted.  No sword bearing beggars

   Instead, here sits in Urish's throne a fat, scaly thing of yellow and

   Greetings it hisses, and beware - for I am the guardian of Urish's

   You are close to vomiting from the stink of the beggars city by

   notice, now that the burning god has been slain, that there is no 
   one about to bid you farewell as you depart the stinking, putrid 
   Nadsokor.

   The great Sighing Desert reaches out as far as you can see.  And it 
   is now that you begin to realize that perhaps the city was a better 
   haven than you had at first thought.
   But the sorcerer Theleb K'aarna still awaits your vengeance and 
   he has left while you were imprisoned.  There is only one place to 
   go from here ...

   The desert stretches on seemingly endlessly.  The sun beats down 
   upon you and you know that soon your strength will fail and the 
   creatures of the desert will make a meal of you.  This thought 
   vanishes as you focus your attention to finding the hidden trail 
   that the sorcerer of Pan Tang has taken to elude you.  You are 
   quite certain that one mistake will lead inevitably to your death.

{MAGENTA}The Hoard of Theleb K'aarna{magenta}~
{CYAN}
   You've come to the cover of a crag.  Here lays the camp of Theleb 
   K'aarna. A wagon and two horses are close by, but all this is 
   dominated by a thing of metal which rears in the center of the 
   clearing.  It is contained in an enormous bowl of clear crystal.  
   The bowl is almost globular with a narrow opening at the top.  
   The device itself is asymmetrical and strange, composed of many 
   curved and angular surfaces which seem to contain a myriad
   of half formed faces, shapes of beasts and buildings, illusive 
   designs coming and going as you look upon it.

   Your realization comes too late, that the sorcerer's forces are too 
   mighty and you must flee.  There is no escape!  

   You notice, then, the beasts emerging from the globe and think 
   perhaps ...

{MAGENTA}Outside the Vanishing Tower{magenta}~
{CYAN}
   Your hasty escape from the horde of Theleb K'aarna has thrown 
   you into this world which you hardly recognize. You have found 
   yourself in a lush green valley thick with trees, a stark change 
   from the harsh desert from which you came.

   Here, rising through the morning mist, stands the vanishing 
   tower.  The tower is in fact a small castle of grey and solid stone, 
   but about its battlements play lights and its outline is not 
   altogether clear at certain sections of its walls.  The tower flickers 
   here and there and you begin to suspect that it is not entirely of 
   this world.  Perhaps it can return you to the world that you have 
   so hastily left.  

   Assuming of course, that it is not inhabited...

{MAGENTA}Inside the Vanishing Tower{magenta}~

   You have entered a small antechamber which is lit by a great oil 
   lamp hanging from the ceiling by chains.

   The door has shut behind you.

   The interior of the tower is much larger than you would have at 
   first suspected.  The stone floor is mostly covered with a large rug 
   which more resembles a tapestry, its scenery slowly changes as 
   you move about the room.  Off to your left is a massive stone 
   staircase which spirals up through the ceiling.  You can plainly 
   tell that you are not the only occupants of the tower.

   The staircase spirals further up into the tower.  There is light that
   trickles about the walls which seems to be coming from further up
   ahead.

   The tower gives of warmth and a soft glow of its own.  This is a
   place of great sorcery.  As you look out one of the windows that is
   sporadically placed along the outside wall you can see that the
   tower has again shifted through the planes and is now in the
   middle of a great ocean.  You pray that the tower is able to deposit
   you into a friendlier location, for you know that there are far worse
   places than this.

   You have reached the top of the tower.  As you enter the upper
   most level you can feel it shudder as it silently shifts yet again. 
   Through the windows you see a cornucopia of colors shift and 
   flow outside, the Chaos and Law of the universe battling in the
   seam between the worlds.  You know that if it were not for the
   walls of the tower you would surely be dead.... at best.

   Off to one side of the room there is an arched doorway.  The light
   that you had seen earlier has apparently originated here.  You have
   a strong feeling that your fate will be decided there.  Pray that you
   have the strength.

   Here you find a room filled luxuriously with the comforts of a
   thousand worlds.   There is a large flame suspended in the air
   apparently of its own accord.  There is a hum emanating from the
   stone that makes this room.  You notice that there is a large mirror
   leaning against the far wall and you can see the landscapes of other
   worlds as they flicker by, unmarred by the scenes of blurred color
   you had seen often outside the windows.

   Standing in the middle of the room, as if he had been awaiting you
   arrival here, is a large dwarf who claims that he is the master of
   this Vanishing Tower.  He tells you in reassuring tones that you are
   his guests here ....  for eternity.

   You find yourself returned to the desert from which you left.  The
   sun beats down upon you intensely.  The horde of Theleb Kaarna
   has departed and is moving on Tanelorn.  His intent is to sac the
   city and gain the favor of the Lords of Chaos, for the Lords of
   chaos have forever sought the destruction of the inhabitants of the
   eternal city. 

   You follow the trail that the horde has left and pray that you arrive
   in time to exact your revenge upon the four wizard.

   plainly outmatched.  You peer about the battlefield in search of the
   sorcerer and spy him in the very center of the battle.  He is in a
   pitched battle with what appears from this distance to be another
   sorcerer.  AHH at last !  First, however, you must fight your way to
   the center of the melee, which appears to be much more difficult
   than you had at first thought.

   marble staircase spiral slightly up to a balcony which leads to the 
   upper reaches of the castle.  There are several large passages 
   which lead from here.  You can hear the whaling of enslaved 
   elementals throughout the place and think that death is a small 
   price to pay for vengeance !

{BOLD}{BLACK}A Place of Solitude{bold}{black}~
{CYAN}
   You suddenly find yourself in a quiet paradise.  There is lush
   foliage all around and you can see all manner of strange life here. 
   The sun shines down from a sky of deep blue and you can feel the
   sweet air brush by your lips.  You can plainly see that here is a
   place of balance.

{BOLD}{BLACK}An Intersection{bold}{black}~
{CYAN}
   You have stumbled upon a turning point.  The forest splits here.  In
   one direction you notice that all movement has ceased, and
   everything that lays before you is strangely uniform.  In the other
   direction you can see a stark contrast, everything you see seems to
   be losing all cohesion.  It is obvious to you that you have found the
   way to the heart of the opposites.

{BOLD}{BLACK}A Land of Order{bold}{black}~
{CYAN}
   The path you have chosen has become even more ordered and
   perhaps also stagnant.  You can see that the variety of things has
   diminished, there is very little here to find surprising, for how can
   there be anything unexpected in something that is nearing perfect
   order ?

{BOLD}{BLACK}The Strait and Narrow Path{bold}{black}~
{CYAN}
   All that you can see is perfect and identical.  Each tree looks as the
   other, each blade of grass is of the same height and points in the
   same exact direction.  The birds that you see fly in beautiful
   patterns, separated by identical distance.  The rocks of the trail are
   all aligned, naturally, in identical rows.

{BOLD}{BLACK}The State of Nul Entropy{bold}{black}~
{CYAN}
   You no longer recognize anything, it is all the same.  A flat grey
   which has no depth, nor identifying characteristics.  You can not
   tell one direction from another except that no matter which
   direction you move you appear to be in the same place.  You are
   lost.

{BOLD}{BLACK}The Realm of Law{bold}{black}~
{CYAN}
   You have arrived at the center of the realm of Law.  It is
   magnificent.  Everywhere you look all is clean and in perfect
   order.  It is beyond the understanding of mortals.  How can
   something of perfect order have such variance.  It seems illogical
   but it is true.  Everywhere you look the singleness of this
   perfection is of pristine beauty.  Yet there is nothing here.  It is
   utterly dead ......   Except for the presence which stands before you.

{BOLD}{BLACK}A Land of Disorder{bold}{black}~
{CYAN}
   You stand on a path which has diverged from the tranquility of the
   forest you were just in.  You can see that the further in you walk
   the less natural things look.  It is as if all the things here have been
   growing in the absence of any order.  Occasionally you see things
   that simply don't make any sense to you, a leaf which does not fall
   as it is blown from the tree, or reflections off of dark dull surfaces. 
   It seems that the rules you are used to do not necessarily apply
   here.

{BOLD}{BLACK}A Twisted Winding Path{bold}{black}~
{CYAN}
   The path you are on begins to twist and wind through the forest in
   no particular manner.  In places it turns and crosses over itself,
   although it serves no purpose of any kind.  You can see grass
   growing on the surface of a pond and in places you can see waves
   rippling across the ground.  The sun is shining, but it seems to get
   darker the higher in the sky it gets.  All the things you knew to be
   true are slowly disappearing the deeper into this forest you get.

{BOLD}{BLACK}The State of Infinite Entropy{bold}{black}~
{CYAN}
   The land has become so chaotic that you are unsure of your footing
   and are having trouble keeping your bearings.  Everything you see
   has no definite shape and occasionally you see something rend
   itself apart into a massive explosion of fine dust.  The whole world
   it seems has no definition and there is nothing you can do but push
   forward.

{BOLD}{BLACK}The Perfection of Chaos{bold}{black}~
{CYAN}
   You have reached an area of perfect diversity.  Every single thing
   that you see is different.  All of the objects here are entirely unique
   and you don't recognize any of them.  There is a torrent of energy
   here, bound to nothing, simply loose and raging in the space that is
   total Chaos.

{BOLD}{BLACK}The Realm of Chaos{bold}{black}~
{CYAN}
   You have reached the center of the realm of Chaos.  You can see
   an endless city of twisted spires reaching in no particular direction. 
   The diversity of what you see here is staggering.  There is a
   multitude of colors raging about the sky and you can see the dark
   foreboding rainbow of color that heralds the coming storm.

   There is a figure before you, however.  He is tall and regal, and
   utterly evil.  You can see in his beautiful porcelain features
   strength and great power.  He is Arioch, Lord of Chaos!  And the
   fear begins to set in .....

   You can sense that you are reaching your goal.  Elric is not far
   ahead now, and soon you will come face to face with the white
   skinned reaver !  Both you and he have left a trail of corpses in
   your wake... but now the fate of the universe will be decided.  If
   you arrive in time you may yet have time to stop the annihilation
   of all creation !

{BOLD}{BLACK}The Last Moment of Creation{bold}{black}~
{CYAN}
   You are in a desolate landscape, there is nothing here except for
   the desert sand.  The sky is a strange color, a mix of orange and
   purple.  There is no conflict, all is still.  In the distance you can see
   a lone figure, a pale skinned albino alone in the endless drifts of
   red sand.  The moment of decision is upon you, will you enter into
   combat with the last Emperor of Melnibone ?  Or will you flee
   leaving all that exists to certain doom !?  The time is now ....

{BOLD}{BLACK}The End of Time{bold}{black}~
{CYAN}
   The roads you have traveled end here.  In the barren world at the end of 
   time.  You have followed Elric here to the culmination of his destiny, 
   when he blows the horn of fate and the universe is re-created, erasing all 
   that has come before.  The war between Law and Chaos forever ending in 
   a stalemate.

   Elric, the last emperor of Melnibone, stands here and regards you with 
   brooding, melancholy eyes.  He knows what it means, what he must do.  
   His chalk white albino skin is covered slightly with the dust of this 
   nowhere, and his crimson eyes flash with evil as the mighty runeblade 
   Stormbringer lunges at your throat of its own accord.
