{W,BO}Standing Before a Large Building{bo}~
   
   You are standing on a quiet road.  A cold wind blows on your back,
causing you to shiver.  To the north stands one of the largest 
buildings you have seen in your life.  The building's polished white 
marble sides shine brightly before your eyes.  Light shines out of 
the front door of the building, leaving you intrigued as to what 
might be inside.

{W,BO}At the Entrance{bo}~
   
   You stand at the entrance of the building.  It seems to be a factory
of sorts.  A sign on the door says that the show room is open, but you
haven't seen anyone enter or exit the building so you aren't sure what
to think.  The door doesn't appear to be locked, and the light inside at
least suggests they are still open.  You better get inside before you
catch a cold!

{W,BO}Inside the Factory{bo}~
   
   You stand just inside the factory.  The display area is directly
north of you.  Zombie-like teenagers in uniform blue shirts wander
around stocking shelves and taking inventory.  To the west is a
hallway where the restrooms are located.  In addition to the restroom
doors, there is also a door which appears to lead toward a stairway.  
Very interesting.

{bo,W}A Deeper Chamber of the Cyborg Creation Tank{bo}~
   
   You have reached the deepest chamber of the cyborg creation proccess.  To
the north seems to be some sort of portal leading to an even greater stage of
the proccess.  If only you could open it...but the current is strong!

This is a rather thick glass portal that you can easily open with all the water pressure
behind it.  As you try to peer through the glass you see many horrors inside.  Humans are being
butchered and thrown into the solution as powerful robots adopt their flesh.  A strong
electromagnetic field prevents anyone from entering...

{BO,Y}Somewhere in the vast...{bo}~
   
   This room won't make any sense!!!
     It's minlevel 51!
    talk to me (zieb) about how it works if you are confused.

this~
   This room is minlevel 51 so no morts can get in.  They have to successfully
complete the slide rooms and close the appropriate doors to open the door leading
to this room.  Then the mobs will wander out into those rooms so that they can kill
them.  This is not an easy task to complete.
   The equipment in this room (the remains) each have 1 item in them (until eq is at limit)
The powerful cyborg picks up one of these at random if all are filled.  If one is empty
(because eq in it is at limit) then he will pick up another one (except the one with
the FRIGGIN LASER because the weight of the laser is too much).  So instead of always getting
the same equipment all the time mortals doing this will get a different piece each time.
   Once equipment is at limit it will be harder to get it.  Like if all but 1 piece was at limit
they would have a 1/6 + 1/5 chance of getting it, depending upon which container the powerful
picks up.  If they don't get it, tough cookies :P

this2~
  The remaining object (which I ran out of free object number for) I was hoping
to have as a hold weapon (+100hp -20armor minlevel 78: The Cracked Circuit Board)
so that it will go along with the other eq stats.  I think the zone is difficult enough
for this caliber of equipment, but lowering it is fine if you want to make sure (with
mortals testing it), but I don't want anyone to save them from getting sacced...
    Anyways,
    -Zieb

{bo,Y}Entrance to the Cybernetics Laboratory{bo}~
   
   You stand at the entrance of a large laboratory.  Rows of cages and 
technicians span before you.  The screams of beast and man alike ring
in your ears like thunder as you make your way in.  The technicians
seem aware of your presence and scramble to release their hideous 
cybernetically enhanced creatures.

   You stand before a thick steel vault leading into a large operating 
chamber.  All the technicians and even the cybernetic beasts are afraid
to come near the entrance of this chamber.  Strange!  Maybe you should
just turn back now and get back to Midgaard before dark.

This is no ordinary steel door, this is a real vault!  There is no way anyone
could get in, or out, without the proper key.  This thing is probably a few feet
thick!

   You've stumbled into a massive dungeon area.  The company president
must cast his foes into this room and watch them die a painful death
from the massive robot programmed to destroy.  Your only escape is to
climb up back into the suite, but that would be impossible while the
massive robot is around.

extremely vicious looking robot is hiding down here in the pit,
sharpening it's claws and waiting to pounce on whatever helpless 
robot might fall in.
