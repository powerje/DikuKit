    Rhythmically, a sound invades your ears,
    the more it is heard the more welcome it
    becomes, until everything else is nothing,
    and all that is important is the new music,
    this beautifully created image that seems to
    have been created to relate specifically to
    you, your pain, your hopes, your desires, the
    new sound welcomes you..

    Come on!
    
    Save some for me, it's what I like.
    I wanna play, you know it's time.
    Something is calling, I can't keep from falling.
    
    Come on! It's on!
    
    You'll see it's my fault, angels stabbing me inside.
    Nothing changes, just rearranges, for me this time.
    
    Once I give in, what can I fight?
    I can never win, my self I don't like,
    I don't like, I don't like, I don't like.

   The aggression of your fellow koRn fans seems to radiate 
   and create an extremely violent aura. Spikes and studs 
   dig into your flesh from all sides as the anticipation of
   the crowd turns into frustration and impatience. You hope 
   koRn takes the stage soon and the crowd calms down. But 
   let's be realistic... What are the chances of koRn CALMING
   this crowd?

    With so many people milling about ahead of you it is hard to see what

    and doing some last second tuning in an effort to get the opening acts
    out on the stage. The rest of the crowd back here seems content to avoid

    Definitely a decent few of the stage from here. Far ahead and to the right
    one can see a stage entrance. It might be possible to reach the band if
    one was enterprising enough. There is more jostling of bodies and it seems
    like it will only get worse the closer to the stage one gets. Might as well
    find a spot and enjoy the show - just try not to get punched during the
    moshing.

    Someone gave up trying to get to the stage and decided they would
    just mosh back here, leaving a small puddle of blood and a couple
    pissed off fans. The excitement level is coming to a frenzy over here,
    hopefully the warm up band gets on stage soon, it might be the only way
    to prevent further bloodshed - for now at least.

    is just the natural pulse of the arena. The stage is set,

{BLA,BO}A: 4  {RED}Who Then Now! {bo,WH} - {BLA,BO,UND}koRn{und}~
{BLACK,BOLD}
   The lights hanging from the top of the arena
   start to dim and the crowd goes wild. A "koRn"
   chant starts to surface from the depths of the
   audience and you can't resist joining in. A 
   few fans are starting to get violent and the
   show has yet to even start! Boy, this could 
   get ugly.

    Dead set for center stage, if only the mosh pit were not so violent
    just ahead. Probably best to stay away from that area. The crowd around
    here is pretty tough, it is pretty tough to muscle through any direction.
    Maybe the safest thing to do at this point would be to sit back, relax,
    and enjoy the show - when is it going to start anyway?

    The confusion is palpable as people scream and cheer,
    waiting for the magic moment when koRn will grace the stage!
    Everyone's excitement is building up in anticipation, several
    fights have broken out already.  It might be unwise to hang
    about too long, but you never know what you can find in a
    concert.  The tunes are rocking and the clock is ticking,
    when will then be now!?

    Muscling through the crowd has taken its toll on your body,
    various aches and pains make it difficult to forge ahead. It
    really does not seem like you have enough vigor to fight the

    The mosh pit just ahead and in front of the stage is in a real frenzy,
    you count 3 teeth flying in the air at any moment. One guy with a black
    eye is slinking his way out of the crowd and gives you a baleful glare
    as soon as he notices you noticing him. You overhear the muffled speech
    of the security crew to your right, it isn't really fair that they get
    such close access to the band, is it?

The meaning of ball tongue is simple. Some
thought it had to do with oral sex, but in
fact its about a guy we had to work with on
a t-shirt (Jeff Creath). He either had a pierced
tongue or a wart or something on his tongue and
he was a dick to us.

It was written because all these little kids
sing these nursery rhymes and they don't know
what they originally meant. Everyone is so happy
when singing but 'London Bridge' is about the
Black Plague. All of them have these evil stories
behind them.  The lyrics are all from nursery rhymes,
and a lot of nursery rhymes go back to the Middle Ages.
They're actually pretty twisted if you know the stories
behind them, like about Black Death and stuff.

Chi is about a lot of alcohol and drug abuse.

he loves reggae music.

out and my brain would start to get freaky and get
schizophrenic and stuff, and I'd tape it and watch
it everyday over and over... I don't know, I was sick
in the head. As a kid he told me to be polite and all
it did was get me picked on. I f**king hate that man.
Thanks for making me polite and trusting everyone, and
easy to take advantage of. So I spent 3 months on that
one song, just tweakin' on it, and it was totally just
my Mr. Rogers obsession, about how evil I thought he was.
Pretty much drug induced.

Song Meaning, Jonathan:
People think it's sexist but it isn't. It's
more subconcious b*tching at all the women
who've been with me in my life. It's not about
women in general, just those women who hurt me.
Initially, we wrote it to send to American radio
for a joke, because they always chop up all the
other songs. So we were going to send a 'real'
single seven days later.

Song Meaning, Jonathan:
That was the last song I wrote, and I was
so burned at writing out lyrics because everytime
I write I get depressed because I start thinking
about things, you know? So the whole song is about
that. In the chorus it says, 'Before day, my sun will
be dying'. It's because I put myself on the line all the
time and for what? Because people aren't going to
be listening to it anyway.

{YEL,BO}C:\mp3\koRn\koRn - Life is Peachy - Kill You.mp3{bo}~
{BLA,BO}
Song Meaning, Jonathan:
It's about a relative I first met when I was 12.
I f**king hate that b*tch. She's the most evil,
f**ked up person I've met in my whole life. She
hated my guts. She did everything she could to
make my life hell.  Like, when I was sick she'd
feed me tea with Tabasco, which is really hot pepper
oil. She'd make me drink it and say, 'You have to
burn that cold out, boy'. f**ked up sh*t like that.
So every nightwhen I'd go to sleep, I'd dream of
killing that b*tch. In some sick way I had a
sexual fantasy about her, and I don't know what
that stems from or why, but I always dreamt about
f**king her and killing her.

It's On is my sh*t peer pressure song. Me
being so stressed out going out and
partying. Everybody's just going 'Come on
dude, it's on.' That's partying, it's
alcohol, cocaine, women. All that wrapped
into one. I wrote a song about it. And
the chorus I talked about Why am I really
doing this? It's all my fault that I'm
doing this because all the alcohol, the
booze and the chicks do is just make it
worse. They just rearrange all the
problems in a different order that I can deal
with at that moment.

Song Meaning, Jonathan:
One of the best titles I've heard ever for a
song. That's my song against the music industry.
Like me feeling like I'm f**kin' a pimp, a prostitute.
Like I'm paraded around. I'm this freak paraded around but I
got corporate America f**kin' making all the money
while it's taking a part of me. It's like they stole
something from me, they stole my innocence and I'm not calm
anymore. I worry constantly.

That's a song baggin' on myself.  How
everything's always handed to me.  How I

anymore.  Like I want something more out of
life than all this.  And I've got
everything I really need but I sometimes don't
like.  I don't know how to explain
it.  I have to let it sit through the songs
more to actually get into what I
write.  I truly know, really, the meanings of the
songs almost.  That's what I'm
getting out of it right now.

{WHI}C:\mp3\koRn\koRn - Follow the Leader - Dead Bodies Everywhere.mp3{bo}~
{BLA,BO}
Song Meaning, Jonathan:
That was the song about my parents trying to
keep me out of the music business. 
My father was in it and he knew how it was and
I totally understand now that I
have a son.  I want Nathan to be a musician but I
him don't want him to go through
the hell I went through.  That's the same thing
my Dad was doing.  A lot of people
can relate to it, because it's like the Dad's
wanting their sons to be football
players and their sons want to be doctors or
something.  That peer pressure its
like trying to make them something they're
really not.  And the Dead Bodies thing
is like so I did it and all I got out of it
was dead bodies everywhere and got all
traumatized.  Thanks a lot Dad, Mom.

{WHI}C:\mp3\koRn\koRn - Follow the Leader - Children of the koRn.mp3{bo}~
{BLA,BO}
Song Meaning, Jonathan:
That's the song that Ice Cube is on Cube came
up with the title.  I fed off of
what he wrote, he was talking about growing up
and puberty.  Dictating what he can
do, like how you gonna tell me how to live and
who to f**k?  And all this stuff. 
And I took that and in my stuff I was talking
about being a kid always known as
the f**kin' town faggot.  It's funny how things
change.  That some of these people
picked on me and all of a sudden look who's
laughing now.  Also in another of the
verse I talked about all these parents
f**kin hating me for what I do, saying I'm
corrupting their children, but in turn
these parents need to step outside of
themselves and really listen to what I'm
talking about.  Then I think they can
understand that they were kids before. 
They're just really quick to judge me. 
All the Children of The Korn are all our
Korn fans.  All those kids going through
that sh*t and feeling what I feel.

Big black cock!  That's what I call a jack and
coke.  Those little glasses they serve in Europe

cock.  And that's another song about me dealing with
the pressures of this album and how I, you know,
I'm trying to kill myself, but you know?  Do I really
want to kill myself?  Things I'm just questioning myself.
Most of this is self-structured.

It's a story about this little girl that came
into the coroner's office when I was

She was an 11 month old little baby
girl.  Her legs were broken back behind her
and he just f**ked her like a toy doll
and chucked her in the bathroom.  It was
the most heinous thing I've ever seen in
my life and I still have nightmares about it.

was mine or Fieldy's or Fred's but we came up with the
idea and we started writing and we worked on it together.
I came up with some bags on myself for Fred to say.  It
was all in good natured fun.

This one is about the whole band and about
all my life being called a homosexual. 
And then I became this big rock star in a
band and I'm still called a fag even by
my own band.  So it's like I was f**kin'
pissed off at them.  It's like erase them
all because I'm gonna reclaim my place
and say hey, they owe a lot to me for what
I did, and I owe a lot to them back. 
But, it still kinda sucks.  I've never ever
gotten away from that fag f**kin'
title.  Just because I'm a sensitive kinda guy. 
Kinda feminine it really sucks.

Justin, that was the kid dying terminally
with intestinal cancer.  His last dying
wish was to meet us and it really freaked
me out.  That threw a whole bunch of new
kind of pressures on my head.  That's
really intense.  Someone's gonna die and his
last thing he wants to do is come
hang out with us.  So I truly just freaked out. 
It's like why would you want to
meet me?  What makes me so special?  And in turn I
talk about how I admire his
strength and his life.  I couldn't stare at him
because he was so content he was
gonna die.  No one could look him in the eyes. 
And I totally admire his
strength.  I wish I had it.

Seed.  That's all about the same thing again. 
I was laying in bed in my hotel room,
thinking about do I really need all this stuff? 
All this pressure on me?  Because
I'm a stressed out freak.  It's about Nathan,
it's about every time that I look
into his eyes, I see myself how I used to be,
innocent and stress free.  I'm kind
of jealous of it.  It really sucks, I used to
be that way.  It's like I have to
work so hard at  this thing in my life.  I have
to become a stressed out freak.  I put food on
the table for my child.  Every time
I look in his eyes, I just see myself staring
right back at my ass laughing.  I was like care
free, innocent as a child.   It's really weird
and I'm really jealous of it.

lyrics.  He's going on about chicks and my

anyone and really let them in after I got
hurt really really bad by a girl.  I've
let Renee in a little bit, to be honest,
but I'll never be that in love ever

Renee always wanted me to write her a love
song and that's why I called it My Gift
To You.  It's my gift to her, you know how
I get sick.  I always had a fantasy of
f**king her and choking her to death.  I
fantasize about what it would look like
me in her body and watching me do it.  So
it's like a really sick f**ked up song. 
I did it totally like, I love her so
much, I want to take her out of this world. 
It's really strange.  She used to
leave notes on my pillow like 25 ways she'd like
to kill me.  She's got this weird
death fetish.  We're kinda f**kin' freaky.  She
got it.  She's all 'Thank you
that's kinda f**ked up.  I was expecting a f**kin' I
love you, baby kinda song.'
I'm all, 'No, you know me.' I mean I can't do that.

{UNDER}Beg For Me{under} is more of an angry thing
because the whole thing for "Beg For Me" is the crowd.
The only time I was good on tour was when I walked up
onstage and that's what the song is about. Feeling
wanted is something one thing I've always needed.
I was shuffled around so much when I was a kid...Being up
onstage was the only point was the only time when my
anxiety would go away for an hour.
