{BLA,BO}  of square really IS darker than the rest.....{b}

{Y,BO}On a Beam of Sunlight{b}~

{Y,BO}  Climbing the tufts of yellow, you are amazed by the power of the colors
{Y,BO}  around you.  The aggression and warmth of the bit of light you are floating
{Y,BO}  on boggles your reality.  It feels like a place you could spend eternity,
{Y,BO}  just floating about, absorbing the warmth, challenging the skies.  However,
{Y,BO}  something gives you the impression that maybe that is not quite possible.
{Y,BO}  When you look closely around you, you see dark patches in what appeared to
{Y,BO}  be an even coloring.  They look dangerous.....  Somehow aggressive.... But
{Y,BO}  where you got that feeling you cannot really tell.......{b}

{Y,BO}  The closer you get to the source of all that yellow, the more compact
{Y,BO}  your surroundings become.  Somehow more real.  Still, it is getting quite
{Y,BO}  hot here, maybe time to take off some of the stuff you are wearing, before
{Y,BO}  it gets fried to your body.  Yes.  It is definitely getting HOT here.{b}

{BLA,BO}Cellar{b}~

{BLA,BO}  You are wandering in the cold and damp cellars of the palace.  This part
{BLA,BO}  of the cellars doesn't look like it is used a lot.  There are spiderwebs
{BLA,BO}  everywhere and often you have to brush 'm aside to make way for yourself.
{BLA,BO}  Most of the floor is covered in a slimy grudge that seems to be oozing
{BLA,BO}  from the ceiling, and if that isn't enough, you have the distinct feeling
{BLA,BO}  that you are not alone in here.  The whole atmosphere is thick with
{BLA,BO}  dread and foreboding.{b}

{C,BO}The Portal{b}~

{C}  FINALLY!! You found your way out of those cellars.  You find yourself
{C}  standing in front of a gigantic portal here.  The pillars that support
{C}  the arch are ornately carved and give the impression of great, great
{C}  age. This portal must've been here a very, very long time.
{C}  In front of the portal you see two identical looking men, wearing bits
{C}  and pieces of what must once have been a very beautiful set of armor.{b}

{BLA,BO}Entrance to the Shrine{b}~

{BLA,BO}  You are standing in the entrance to a very dark and foreboding shrine.
{BLA,BO}  The evil that has gathered here for years seems to ooze out of the
{BLA,BO}  walls and murals.  The walls are made out of white marble and are 
{BLA,BO}  chiseled into a wide variety of scenes, some depicting sacrifices,
{BLA,BO}  others battles, yet others are of rituals and beings totally unknown
{BLA,BO}  to you.  To the north you see a big black hole in the wall.  That is
{BLA,BO}  where the sense of evil and foreboding is coming from.{b}

{BLA,BO}The Shrine{b}~

{BLA,BO}  You have entered the Shrine of Death.......  A very apt name it seems...
{BLA,BO}  You can see ancient bloodstains on a gruesome eight-sided altar,  the
{BLA,BO}  walls are lined with carvings and fresco's of war, slaughter and 
{BLA,BO}  sacrificial rites.  To your despair you find that the shrine is not
{BLA,BO}  empty, but you seem to be able to make out a Presence.  And the feeling
{BLA,BO}  this place induces in you makes your legs tremble in fear....{b}

{BLA,BO}Death's Transfer Point{b}~

{BLA,BO}  This is the room where all the recently deceased gather and leave
{BLA,BO}  behind their earthly belongings....

{BLA,BO}  Maybe you can find something useful here, or, who knows, maybe the
{BLA,BO}  earthly goods of a recently departed friend or travelling companion.{b}
