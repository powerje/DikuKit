A small home~

   The view of the interior of the peasant's home is poor and run down. The
floor is of earth, beaten as hard as was possible, wet and messy due to damp
weather. There is a fire made on a hob of clay, and about it, its clustered
with cooking utensils. To the side there are a few stolls and a trestle table
on which the meals are eaten.
