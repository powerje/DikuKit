The Smithy~

  You are standing inside a very dark smithy. You notice the absense of
windows, only the red light of the fireplace lightens the room. A lot of
useless broken weapons and pieces of armour are lying around, making
it difficult to cross the room. There is a sign up by the entrance door.

{YEL}Flying just above the roof of the Temple{yel}~

  {YEL}Well, you are able to fly - If not you would be dead now. The shingles
  below you are not sturdy enough by far to carry your weight. The roof
  continues to the north and looks much better there.{yel}

{YEL}On the roof of the Temple{yel}~

  {YEL}This is a safer part of the roof of the Temple.  Here you don't need
  to fly and waste your energy. The roof continues to the north and south.
  Any other direction would be dangerous.{yel}

  {YEL}You are on the very northern part of the roof. Any direction but south
  would be dangerous for your health. Right in front of you there is a huge
  pedestal made of stone.{yel}

pedestal stone~
As you look at the pedestal you see a little sign:

    In memory to all those hard working men and women who helped to built
this phantastic Cathedral. May God bless them and protect their soles from
the golem of glory. We fought hard to ban this creature of evel. But the
story goes the golem lives again. Don't let the gloriol mislead you!

  You are lucky to be able to fly! If not, you would be very flat now.
But even flying isn't easy here because of the heavy wind. Better land
again.

   You are lucky to be able to fly! As you fly over the east
   gate of Midgaard, you notice strange looks from birds and
   other airborne wildlife.  They wonder what awful predator
