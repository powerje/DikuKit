The Beach Head~
   As you leave the bright blue lake and its shimmering waters behind,
you feel a small sensation of remorse pass over you. Never before has 
somthing so natural made you feel so peaceful, so at home. As you take
one last look at the magnificant lake, a small tear gently rolls down
your cheek. You turn back towards the island, and again continue on
with your quest.

A Sandy Path~
   You are walking along a small path that leads away from the
bright blue lake. High overhead you see a small flock of seagulls
heading back west to the lake. All about you are small plants,
flowers, bushes and trees. As you peer ahead you see a small
column of smoke rising from the earth.

The Summit~
   You seem to have reached the summit of a small hill, and now
can see the entire island set before you. You notice that this 
island is teaming with life, and that there seems to be a small
village sitting directly in the middle of the island. Back to
the south you see the putrid marsh, but now you can see above
the enormous cypress'. There seems to be a huge castle floating
above the marsh. Its beauty stuns you, and you almost consider
to go back the way you came and find the entrance to this
unnatural wonder.

Entrance to Centaur Village~
  You are standing upon the most beautiful road that you have ever
seen. It appears to be constructed out of pure ivory. On both
sides of you are two huge statues of a noble Centaur and a fearsome
Dragon in the midst of battle. The ivory road continues to the east
with the small summit back to the west.

   As you walk along this magnificant street, you are inspired by
the grand craftmanship it took to make such beautiful buildings. All
constructed of pure gold, silver, and ivory adourn this fantastic
town. As you continue on with your journey, you notice yet another
street sign. Written upon it is the Greek letter "Sigma", with two
small arrows beneath it. One arrow points to the north, while the
other to the south.

You start to wonder how you know the history behind ancient Greek
writing, but an hour later and one headache richer, you decide to
to forget it and continue onward.

Before the Steps~
   You stand at the foot of a grand stairway made of flowing lava.
All about you flames reach out, trying to burn your delicate skin.
A great temple created magically of fire towers above you. Its
massive columns, made of black granite, loom in the distance. You
wonder why you are not afraid, why you do not turn back. You think
to yourself, be calm, have no fear. This is a place of worship, a
place of good, not evil.

you feel quite at home here. The massive columns of granite
stand beside you with a sense of pride. Etched into these
outstanding columns are the letters "J" and "I". You ponder on
this for a moment but you are left dumbfounded for its significance.
From deep withen the temple you hear a faint humming sound.
It sounds as if great magic can be found withen this temple.

exception: there is no floor. Mist billows from the gaping hole
where the floor once was. The back wall bears a relief statue of
the God Judas Iscariot, the master of this divine and holy
place. It appears that the inhabitants of this town worship
Judas Iscariot. "How odd!" you think to yourself, to worship
the Betrayer of God.

And as you peer around the forest you again hear that strange and
methodical laugh.

Before the Light~
   The pitch black shadows begin to fade as you notice a small light
coming from the north. As you look around the newly illuminated
forest you see items that you did not notice before. The forest floor
seems to be made of a light red substance that radiats heat naturally.
The trees, which you first thought were oak, seem to be a kind of tree
you have never seen before. The trees take on a small light tint instead
of the natural brown color that you are accustomed to.

A Small Camp Site~
   You have entered a small clearing in the forest. A large fire is        
burning unnaturally in the center of the clearing. High above you
the forest trees give way to a beautiful night sky. The brilliant
stars gleam brightly in the dark night and fill you with the feeling
hope and understanding. You then notice a small elf-like creature
standing in the deep shadows of the trees. He grins evily at you
as you enter his domain.

bluewood, splintered at the base, lies across the path to the north.
You hear a quick rustle of leaves overhead as you watch a monsterous
Nighthawk swoop down from the dark night. Her talons are spread wide,
ready to gouge out your heart.
