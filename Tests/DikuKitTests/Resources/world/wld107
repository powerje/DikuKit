The Golden Walk~
   You are surrounded by brilliant gold. Hung upon the eastern wall is a huge
strip of silver, casting your ugly reflection upon it. A small ball of golden
light illuminates this fantasic chamber. A small channel has been burrowed
from the golden floor, letting a dark pool of water run freely down its base.
