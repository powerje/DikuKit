Glacier~
   This is a large mass of ice, moving ever so slowly down toward
the west, forcing its way between two mountains. The footing here
is relatively stable, but the ice and the angle of the slope make
an ascent up the glacier too risky.
   Rising straight up on the north is a tremendous spire of rock,
whose summit is enclosed in the clouds.

   A path leads up from the glacier on the north and there is a
narrow ledge on the southern mountain which could be scrambled up
to - it looks like there's a door there.

Glacier's Bend~
   The glacier makes a bend here, following its path of least
resistance, from the east down toward the south. The surface here
is getting quite slippery and appears to be quite dangerous. With

is clearly impossible.

Glacier's End~
   The glacier comes to an abrupt end here. Its leading edge
appears very unsafe, and several pieces could fall off at any time.
Beyond the edge is a forested valley and a lake. Sheer cliff walls
surround this area on the west and the east. A path is visible well
up the wall on the west, reachable via a rope ladder. The footing
here seems unreliable and the slightest move could be ill-advised.

Small Ledge~
   The ledge here is not large. Indeed, there is hardly any room to
move around. What is more remarkable is the huge door framed directly
into the rock of the mountain. This portal is made entirely of a metal
which doesn't quite look like steel. There is no handle, keyhole,
hinges, or any apparent mechanical devices. Aside from the door, it
is possible to climb down to the surface of the glacier below.

of uneasiness in many people. In truth, it is an unlit passageway
into the inside of some mountain, which was probably purposely
hollowed out by someone, or something, intelligent. The walls are
a bit moist and the air is cold. Whether these conditions are
inviting or threatening is up to the individual and none other.

is that, since this place is a box-like canyon, all these creatures
were trapped here by some thing, or things, which was hungry or

Base of Waterfall~
   From appearances, it looks like this was once a rather important
natural phenomenon. The area at the base of the waterfall has been
beaten down by a great force, and would make a pretty good start on
a bottomless pit. There are also many large rocks which have been
worn smooth by the onrushing water. Now, on the other hand, the
waterfall has been reduced to a small stream which barely makes it
over the top and hardly reaches the rocks below. With the water
mostly gone, a cave has been revealed which can be scrambled into
to the north. A trail to the east is also reachable.

From the forest to the south, to the narrow ribbon of road
extending off to the east, to the jagged peak to the west, to the
hints of more impressive peaks to the north, the view is clean and
clear, as if magically aided. The rock itself has been shaped and
chiseled at in several unique ways. There are holes around the
perimeter of the rock of about the right size to insert poles for
torches, flags, or perhaps something more elaborate. A hollowed out
section could be used as some kind of basin. Down the middle of the
rock are four parallel lines which intersect a circle.

The Great Northern Road~
   This is the Great Northern Road, pounded into existence by
generations of adventurers and traders. It may be a bit dangerous
and harsh, but there is little alternative in this region. It
extends from west to east, on and on. A trail leads south.

Hostel~
   The hostel is a small, climate-controlled one-room building for
travellers to take breaks in. There is a sign on the wall which
implores visitors, "No fighting, stealing, or graffiti on the 
walls. This will be enforced."
   The world and all its dangers is to the east.

to be a clearing of sorts.

Tunnel~
   This is the sort of place which is usually described as dank,
dark, and perhaps a bit spooky - adjectives which create a feeling
of uneasiness in many people. In truth, it is an unlit passageway
into the inside of some mountain, which was probably purposely
hollowed out by someone, or something, intelligent. The walls are
a bit moist and the air is cold. Whether these conditions are
inviting or threatening is up to the individual and none other.
   The tunnel leads from the south into the interior of the
mountain to the north.
