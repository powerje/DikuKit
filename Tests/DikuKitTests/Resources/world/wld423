Before the Tower of Lansfordia~

  You are standing before the Great Tower of Lansfordia.  You can't 
  help but wonder who would have built something so big in the middle
  of nowhere.  There is a huge gateway in the front of the tower and 
  corpses lay scattered about it.  You approach in fear not knowing
  what kind of horific death awaits you!!!

Main Hall Inside the Gateway~

  You are standing inside the first room of the almost neverending
  tower.  On the walls are lined torches illuminating the great hall.
  In the center of the room lies a giant {GREEN}circle{green} carved in the ground.
  There is strange writing around the edge of it which you can't make
  out except for a certain few words.  You look behind and wonder if
  leaving may be the safest option for you.  Should you turn around
  or continue on?  Only one path can be the right way the other can
  only mean death!
