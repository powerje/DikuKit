{G,BO}Green Base{b}~

{G,BO}  Somewhere hidden within the massive arena, a loud voice
{C,BO}  booms loudly off in the distance, "Minions spawn in thirty
{G,BO}  seconds!".  As the company around you readies their weapons,
{C,BO}  your eyes dart around to the three lanes running north, east
{G,BO}  and south. Each of the three are built aside huge, jungle walls.

{C,BO}  After finishing with final preparations, the voice declares:
{G,BO}  "Minions have spawned!".{b}

{G,BO}  The first Top Lane tower stands here firing away at some
{G,BO}  nasty red minions. Like a shriek from hell, a powerful voice
{G,BO}  cries from a black void swirling with maroon tinted blood.
{G,BO}  As minions meet their death around you, one particular creature
{G,BO}  remains. To the east, the jungle's opening is finally reviewed
{G,BO}  and several more blood-freezing screams leave from within. The

{R,BO}End of the Middle Lane{b}~

{R,BO}  Congratulations yet again, Summoner. You've reached the finale
{R,BO}  of the Middle lane. It's a wonder you're still alive, truly. Be
{R,BO}  thankful you still are. So let this be your last test. We'll see
{R,BO}  if you can best the top mage of them all. Be prepared, Summoner.
{R,BO}  This may be your last battle here in Summoner's Rift.{b}

{R}  Woah! You look up and this tower is absolutely enormous!
{R}  The other minions also seem bewildered, but their childish
{R}  brains only allow for a moment of interest. Finally, once
{R}  you stoop from the daze, you notice the sigil stone atop the
{R}  tower beginning to warm, creating a pyro flame vividly spawn
{R}  from thin air. The stoney purple eyes radiate from the strange
{R}  tower.  More jungle rests northwards, and farther down to the
{R}  east, you can begin to see glimpses of the red base.{b}

{BLACK,BOLD}Fix You{black}~

{BLACK,BOLD} When you try your best but you don't succeed.
{BLACK,BOLD} When you get what you want but not what you need.
{BLACK,BOLD} When you feel so tired but you can't sleep.
{BLACK,BOLD} Stuck in reverse.

{BLACK,BOLD} And the tears come streaming down your face.
{BLACK,BOLD} When you lose something you can't replace.
{BLACK,BOLD} When you love someone but it goes to waste.
{BLACK,BOLD} Could it be worse?

{RED,BOLD} Lights will guide you home.
{RED,BOLD} And ignite your bones.
{RED,BOLD} And I will try to fix you.

{BLACK,BOLD} And high up above or down below.
{BLACK,BOLD} When you're too in love to let it go.
{BLACK,BOLD} But if you never try you'll never know.
{BLACK,BOLD} Just what you're worth.

{RED,BOLD} Lights will guide you home.
{RED,BOLD} And ignite your bones.
{RED,BOLD} And I will try to fix you.

{BLACK,BOLD} Tears stream down your face.
{BLACK,BOLD} When you lose something you cannot replace
{BLACK,BOLD} Tears stream down your face
