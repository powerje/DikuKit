{R}The Dwarven Ruins{r}~
{R}
   As your eyes begin to adjust, an enormous mountain range
   fills your vision. A ruined fort of dwarven make blocks the
   only path to the mountains. It looks like your only choice
   is to go through the ruins. Better be careful.

{R}The Dwarven Ruins{r}~
{R}
   Climbing and pulling yourself along what serves as a path,
   you see large worn down slabs of some unknown rock that
   probably served as walls to this former fortress. Inspecting
   these closer reveals strange engravings that confirm your
   thoughts. This was indeed part of the fortress.

{R}The Dwarven Stronghold{r}~
{R}
   This stronghold was perfectly camouflaged by the mountains
   and the ruins, and probably by dwarven magic. The size and
   beauty of the stronghold is overwhelming. Woven tapestries
   adorning the walls depict mighty dwarven battles and the
   creation of important dwarven innovations. The hard stone
   floor is likewise dotted with superbly crafted statues of
   great dwarven heros.

{R}A Trail Through The Mountains{r}~
{R}
   Leaving behind the beauty of the dwarves, you set out on the
   the barren trail ahead. Very little can grow in this harsh
   wasteland. Large holes in the ground have been made in an
   attempt to collect some rainwater, but even these are dried
   out and collect only sand and rocks. Best to continue on in
   hopes of more hospitable terrain.

   A small village seems to have developed near the trading

   their weapons. It would probably be best to pass through

{R}High atop the Kher Ridge mountains{r}~
{R}   At last you've finally reached the very summit of the Kher Ridge mountains.
   The top of this mountain is actually a rather large plateau.  Looking around
   you can't help but marvel at it's beauty.  Looking in the four cardinal
   directions so can see wide sweeping plains to the east, lush green forests 
   to the west, sparkling blue oceans dotted with islands north, and murky
   black swamps south.  What an amazing view.{r}

  {G}You stand in one of the horrific burned out patches caused by man's war with
nature.  This was the site of the last great battle of the Llanowar elves.  There
are still rumored to be some of this great race left but no one has seen them for 
sure in many years.  Tread carefully here and remember the elves for what they were,
a great and mighty race.{g}

{G}The Path to Yavimaya{g}~
{G}   You have found the magical shortcut to harsh forest of Yavimaya. Years ago,
   the elves and druids of Havenwood, Yavimaya, and Fyndhorn worked together to make
   these magical paths in order to offer aid to each other in case of attack.  One
   single step actually carries you many leagues across Dominaria allowing you to
   reach Yavimaya very quickly. {g}

{G}The Lush Forests Of Yavimaya{g}~
{G}   As you walk boldly into the lush majesty of the Yavimaya forest, you are
   immediately humbled by its' grandeur and age.  Much of this forest hasn't been
   seen by human eyes in hundreds of years. Many of these large oaks and pines are
   big enough to build an entire house from one tree.  Amazing, you think, as you
   attempt to find any trace of a trail.{g}

{G}Escape{g}~
{G}   At last you've escaped the Yavamaya forest.  Now at least you understand why
   all those natural resources have been untapped for so long.  While you may
   have done some damage to their system and order you have no doubt that soon it
   will be repaired and once again this land will lay dormant waiting its' next 
   victims.{g}

{G}The Path to Fyndhorn{g}~
{G}   Once again you are on a magically created path carrying you very quickly
   towards the ancient forest of Fyndhorn. You can feel the air getting colder and 
   colder with each breath you take. Just hold on, you're almost there.{g}

{G}Fyndhorn Forest{g}~
{G}   As you trudge through the snow miserably, you look around at all the green
   pine trees about you and smile at the distinct contrast. It looks like something
   from a Norman Rockwell painting that is until you look down and see the large
   strange footprints in the snow.  Best to move along and avoid whatever made those
   tracks.  {g}

{G}   At last you've reached the end of the forest.  In this room is your power to
