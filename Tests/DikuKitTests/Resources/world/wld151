{BLUE}In a Halcyon Daze... {blu}~
You pass through a cool light mist, and enter Halcyon's quarters.  The 
room radiates green from the stained glass windows.  As you step, the cold 
stone floor and walls send chills up and down your spine.  An open copy of 
-The Existentialist- lies atop religious gobbledygook and spell theory.
Bottles of herbs and chemicals sit on a slate bench in the far corner.  
The sound of dripping water draws your attention toward an experiment of 
some sort.

{BLU}link 15174 {blu}~
You are in a small room buried far beneath the earth. It appears to be one
of those small university type dorms. On the walls sit some shelves which 
hold boring books. There are also numerous color posters of characters
from those Japanese animation cartoons. There is a small table upon
which sits a primitive calculating machine. Looking at the machine display,
a piece of torn paper draws your attention.

WOW! These are really cool!
Several of these posters are portraits of a really really pretty girl with

You see various books on Computer Science - yuck!
One title in particular catches your eye - "The joys of mudding."

{BLACK,BOLD}The {BLUE}QU{BLACK}-{bold}{BLUE}fountain{bl}~
{BLUE}    In the center of this small room sits a fountain bubbling forth
the divine liquid of jolt.  Be warned, this beverage is made of powerful
things and it packs quite a kick!  The {RED}+{BLU,BOL}QU{bold}{RED}+ {BLUE}are a sober bunch, so it takes
a strong brew to quench their neverending thirst.

{BLU}Zane's Pad{blu}~
The large room you are standing in is adorned with the sculptures of many 
powerful beasts. Stone gargoyles, chimera, griffins, and basilisks guard 
the abode of Zane, master warrior and mage. You feel small and unimportant
in the presence of these majestic and powerful beasts. While imposing, this 
room also looks very cozy and comfortable. A large ornate wooden chair sits 
by a desk cluttered with scrolls and the huge, glowing monitor of a Power 
Macintosh 9500.  Apparently Zane, like most QU, embrace the contradictory. 
The ancient and the futuristic co-exist in this place in perfect harmony, 
providing Zane the benefits of both.

The Code of the QU:
1) All QU MUST at all times remember that this is a game that is meant to be
enjoyed.
2) All QU should, with the best of their abilities, make this game enjoyable
for others.
3) All QU must respect their fellow QU and their fellow mudders.
4) All QU must respect the higher ranking QU.
5) All QU should teach the lower ranking QU the ways of the continuum. 
Co-operation makes us strong.
6) Any QU failing to abide by this code may be subject to excommunication by
the descision of the QU Council and/or the QU Prime.

~

The Constitution of the QU Continuum:
1) All QU are bound by The Code of the QU.
2) The QU shall follow the leadership and descisions of the QU Council and/or
the QU Prime. Members of the QU Council may only be appointed by the QU Prime.
3) Officers of the QU (club levels 6-9) may only be appointed by the QU Prime.
4) All QU may nominate themselves or other QU for promotion within the ranks
to be reviewed by the QU Council. Upon approval by the Council, the QU Prime
shall grant the promotion. The QU Prime reserves the right to promote any QU
as he/she sees as beneficial to the Continuum.
5) The QU Council has the right and power to recruit new members as well as
excommunicate members.
6) All QU has the right to voice opinions and concerns about the Continuum
without censorship. But vulgarity is not the way of the QU.
7) The QU Prime has the right to veto the descisions of the QU Council if 
he/she finds that the descision does not abide by the Code of the QU.

You step into a long room with a large table in the center. There is a large
throne at one end of the table. You read the name 'JAWS' along the top of

No wonder she always smiles.

{BLA,BOL}The {bold}{RED}+{BLUE,BOLD}QU{bold}{RED}+ {BLA,BOL}Tranquility Creek{bl}~
Following the sound of running water, you make your way thru a dense
oak grove to behold this creek. Sunlight sparkles off the water as
it bubbles and dances over the rocks. Tiny minnows dart and play 
in the crystal clear waters. Farther down water cascades over a 
fall into a deep pool. Looking around you see a large log and when
settling here you are flooded with a sense of peace and tranquility.
Squirrels chatter and play in the treetops above you, while a brave
one hops upon the log to lay its eyes upon the warrior before him.
Relax and be one with yourself as it has been a hard day of battle.

{BLACK,BOLD}The {BLUE}QU{BLACK}-{bold}{BLUE}fountain{bl}~
{BLUE}    In the center of this small room sits a fountain bubbling forth
the divine liquid of jolt.  Be warned, this beverage is made of powerful
things and it packs quite a kick!  The {RED}+{BLU,BOL}QU{bold}{RED}+ {BLUE}are a sober bunch, so it takes
a strong brew to quench their neverending thirst.

{BLUE}Even though the {RED}+{BLU,BOLD}QU{bold}{RED}+{BLUE} do not require money here in the Continuum, it is a 
useful commodity to have in the city of Midgaard.  What better place to 
keep it than in the Continuum itself?  Here, it will be safe for eternity!

{BLUE}This is where the QU come to retire for the day. Where their individual
consciousness becomes one with the continuum until they decide to emerge 
again. Physical objects must be put away for keeping because they cannot
exist within this plane of the continuum.

{BL,BO}The {r}{R}+{BLU,BO}QU{r}{R}+ {BL,BO}Rest Room{b}~
{BLU}Grab yourself a seat on the couch, or settle into the thick
shag carpet and stretch out. Relax and lose yourself in thought.
This room is large enough to hold everyone you know, but still
feels small and comfortable. The area is soothing and as you
stare blankly, you come to realize it shifts the perception of
each person to suit their own tastes, making them feel entirely
at ease. This{R}... {BLU}is the essence of the {R}QU{BLU}.

{BOLD}{BLACK}Chamber{black}{bold} {BOLD}of{bold} {BOLD}{YELLOW}Mirrors{yellow}{bold}!~
     As you wander farther and farther into this strange castle, you come
to a chamber that is devoid of any trappings common to the rest of the
castle.  As you glance around this cold and barren room, you notice a tall
mirror that you had not seen before in one of the far corners.  When you walk
over to the mirror and look within its crystalline depths, you begin to see
image after image of the city of {GREEN}Midgaard{green} and the rest of this world pass
quickly before your eyes.  Understanding, Awe, and no small amount of Fear
come to you all at once.  This is where {RED}Airagar{red}, {BLUE}Lord of {CYAN}Wind{cyan}, surveys and
watches this world.
You are within the legendary {BLACK}Chamber{black} of {YELLOW}Mirrors{yellow}!

{BLUE}The equipment of mortals are shoddy and tend to wear and tear. That's the
craftsmanship one would expect from mere mortals. But what can you do.
Nothing really, except to have someone who can repair your equipment.

{BLUE}You are standing in the {RED}QU {BLU}Continuum. This is where the {RED}QU{BLU} gather
to rest, refresh or and plan their zone tactics. It is hard to 
describe what you see because there are no words that you could
use. It is strange, yet familiar. Spacious, yet confining. It is 
a plane of existance you do not comprehend. As a member of {RED}QU {BLU}you
will eventually learn the secrets of the Universe and of the {RED}QU{BLU}.
