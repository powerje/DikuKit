   A large arena is here, and the roar of the crowds echo 
   throughout the hallway.  It seems that there's some sort
   of contest going on in the main venue, though it's too
   late for you to get good seats.
 
   Off to the side, a rather bored-looking individual sits 
   behind a counter, waiting for customers.  What could
   he possibly be selling?

Ancient Treehouse~
 
   This treehouse is very roomy, and appears to be
   extremely well constructed. The fabled Questmaster
   lives in this residence - maybe if you're worthy
   he will reward you with a unique gift!

Climbing to the treehouse~
 
   A rope ladder hangs against a tree, it looks fairly
   safe to climb. Above your head, firmly lodged in the
   strong upper branches of the tree is a cool looking
   treehouse.

   Welcome to the Quest Point Redemption Center!  The room is
   brightly lit, with rows of glass display cases on the
   showroom floor.  Browsing around, you see a variety of
   weapons, armors, and equipment for sale.  You press your
   grubby little fingers against one case as you drool over 
   the{c} {Y,BO}Gold Hilted Sword{y,bo} {C}on sale for 1 Million Quest Points.
   Another case shows off{c} {BLU,BO}Th{blu,bo}{C,BO}e S{c,bo}{W,BO}ilicon{w,bo} {C,BO}Ch{c,bo}{BLU,BO}ip{blu,bo}{C}, nicely polished

   a brand new{c} {BLU}Guyver{blu} {C}Unit{c} {W}Full Body Armor{w}{C}, though you can't
   figure out what to call the value when it has so many 
   zeros at the end.
