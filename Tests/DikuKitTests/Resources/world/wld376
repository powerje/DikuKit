Paved Road on the outskirts of town~
  {CYAN}
     You've reached a concrete path at the outskirts of town. In the 
     distance, you see a path leading to some sort of corporate high
     rise. The trees and hedges are neatly cut as they are trimmed 
     on a frequent basis. The road leading to the office is washed off. 
     Seems like this place is very operative.

Paved Road on the outskirts of town~
  {CYAN}
     Continuing up the walkway, you have a better view of the 
     high rise ahead. The name OSCORP hangs over the doorway to
     the building. Security around this building looks intense. 
     The guards are patrolling every inch of the grounds for 
     suspicious activity. Unless you have business with anyone 
     in OSCORP, I wouldn't suggest messing with these guys.

Entrance to the OSCORP Corporate Office.~
   {CYAN}
     You are standing in front of the OSCORP Corporate office. 
     As you approach the tall sliding glass doors, a robotic 
     voice bids you welcome. As you look inside the lobby of the 
     OSCORP building, you are greeted by suspicious stares from 
     the receptionist, the patrolling guards, and some other 
     notable guests of the building.

Lobby of the OSCORP Corporate Office~

     As you enter the high rise, you notice the lobby is clamoring 
     with secret service-type security guards and building 
     patrons. It would seem as if someone very important was 
     currently in the building. Directly to the north of you is 
     the main elevator, which seems to be under repair at the moment. 
     The receptionist seems to have her hands full with the switchboard 
     going off every second.

     The security guards have noticed your presence and are watching 
     closely your suspicious behavior and clothing. Security cameras 
     trace your movement through the lobby. Apparently in here, you 
     are considered a high security risk and should be carefully  
     watched.

     in a frenzy of phone calls. Guests crowd her desk area 
     asking her for directions in the building. You don't want to get 
     too close to the receptionist as she might bite your head off.

     plants is a lazy security guard taking a little mid afternoon 
     nap. In the corner of the wall, a security camera is recording 
     everything that is going on the lobby.

     would ever use the stairs to get to their offices.

Mail Room at OSCORP - Basement~
   {CYAN}
     As you descend the secret stairs underneath the receptionist's 
     desk, you enter a place where all executives would hope they 
     would never have to go to - the mail room. The executives 
     dislike the idea of working alongside such underpaid, 
     overworked employees that complain each day for better wages. 
     As you glance across the entire floor, you see mail clerks, 
     like sweat shop workers, trying to get the daily mail in 
     order and sent upstairs on time. The mail clerks here don't 
     look too happy to be working here, nor do they like 
     unwanted visitors that would prevent them from completing 
     their jobs.

     Mail clerks are busy trying to get their job done while
     this ancient equipment just messes them up. You wouldn't 
     want to stand too close to any of the rotating gears because 
     they might snap you. The area feels a little stuffy.

     yesterday. Around the side of the table, hungry rats try to

     busy doing tremendous amounts of work alongside his fellow 
     inferiors who are busy working hard trying to get their 
     daily tasks done.

     mailbox is completely empty. As you try to take a closer look, 
     a mail clerk nudges you to get out of the way so that they can

     As you try to glance at some more names, a mail clerk nudges

Accounts Payable/Receivable Supervisor's Office - Second Floor~
  {CYAN}
     You are standing in the office of the accounting supervisor. 
     The desk and floor are cluttered with important documents. You 
     can almost see a faint outline of what could possibly be a file 
     cabinet in his office. As you get in closer, you hear a faint 
     moaning in the middle of the office but can't tell where it's 
     coming from. As you walk in closer, you see the back of the 
     accounting supervisor's head buried in paperwork. He doesn't 
     want to be bothered at the moment. Behind his desk is an emergency 
     door that leads to the staircase that goes up to the third floor. 
     Next to the door is a keycard panel and the keycard is conveniently 
     located in the breast pocket of the supervisor.

Top of the Building ?!? - Third Floor~
  {CYAN}
     As you open the door into the third floor, you are surprised 
     to see that you have reached the top of the building. You 
     remember from the outside that this building used to be at least 
     seven or eight floors tall. Feeling a bit confused, you walk 
     in cautiously and glance out to see everything from the roof 
     only to be more confused by the lack of wind. Is this just

     is a table with tons of test shrubs and other special plants. 
     On the eastern side of the lab is a table full of test tubes 
     and dangerous chemicals bubbling out of control. You wonder

Lab - Fifth Floor~
  {CYAN}
     You are at the northwestern end of the lab. Various broken tubes 
     are scattered all around the floor. It seems as if this lab was 
     recently thrashed. You see in front of you a metallic examining 
     table used to experiment on plant life. On the corner of the 
     table you see charts and diagrams to track the progress of certain 
     experiments. Apparently they stopped keeping track of their progress 
     about a month ago. Lab assistances are heading your way to assist you.

Dr. Curt Connors' Office~
{CYAN}
   You have entered a private office in the lab. The sign posted
   on the door reads, Dr. Curt Connors, geneticist. Dr. Connors 
   apparently keeps his office very clean and orderly. In the back 
   corner of the office are file cabinets that are locked with 
   private data from experiments done in this lab. On the wall 
   you notice numerous awards given to Dr. Connors for his 
   contribution to this specific field. As you attempt to walk 
   out of the office, you notice a mysterious green vial 
   situated at the side of his desk alongside a cutoff lizards' 
   tail.

     stepping on the broken glass you notice a cylindrical tube in 
     the center of the room that could be used to test experiments on 
     humans. Around the room are lab technicians trying to clean the 
     mess and also investigate what happened.

     used to experiment on humans. All around the room are lab 
     technicians trying to clean up the mess and also 
     investigate what went wrong in their last test.

     You have finally reached the top floor of the OSCORP Building.
     Expecting to see more of the unusual stuff, you open the 
     stairwell door only to be astonished by such a huge office with
     large windows that overlook the city. As you glance around the
     office, you notice in the corner of your eye some blurred figure
     swinging outside. As you turn to look, the figure is gone. 
     Walking further into the room, you can hear the faint sounds of
     two people arguing, one is a loud harsh, crackly voice while 
     the other is talking with a lot of fear in his voice. You try 
     to rush in to see what's going on.

     sweat dribbles down your face and you can barely hold your weapon
     steady as your hands start to shake uncontrollably. There is
     another door in front of you. As you get closer to the door, 
     you take a sneak peek through the keyhole. You can smell a 
     faint odor coming out from the office. As you take a peek 
     inside, you can see one gentlemen dressed in a business suit, 
     holding his head in extreme pain. Things were already crazy
     enough.

     the chair has been smashed to pieces against the wall, and all the 
     books from the bookshelf are on the floor. You look down and glance 
     at a photo of the CEO and his son.

     is blueprints to other offices, banks, and liquor store. On the 
     wall is a rack full of semi automatic weapons. Apparently the 
     Kingpin is indisposed at the moment. You can wait here if you
