Welcome to Amsterdam!  The city of delight!  We have many a tour organized
for your convenience.  If you are new to this, then we suggest you visit
the Zoo, for the bit more experienced vistors we would propose a visit to
the famed Red Light District, and for the veterans a trip to the palace
(if you can obtain an invitation, that is) or an extraordinary view of
the wonders of the city by canalboat is what our recomendation would be!
But, remember, having fun is the most important part of ANY stay in this
fair town!

{C}  help much in reducing the sense of comfort and happiness that is slowly
{C}  descending on you.

{R}  And to you right you see the house where Anne Frank hid during the 
{R}  Second World War.  That is where she wrote her diary and ......."
{R}  Almost wakes you up.

{Y}  We have arranged a tour of the house, which comes with this trip.

{C,BO}Max's Diamond Cutters{b}~

{C}  This looks like a diamond shop.  Everything is very clean and orderly,
{C}  which is not very surprising, as you wouldn't want to lose a diamond or 
{C}  two in a mess......    As you look around, you notice a security guard
{C}  keeping a close eye on you, making sure you leave everything in place.
{C}  Max himself is a cheerful and happy man, obviously doing very well and
{C}  he seems very willing to help you, still, there's something secretive
{C}  about him that you can't quite make out.....{b}
