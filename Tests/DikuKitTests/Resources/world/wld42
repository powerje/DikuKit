  This is the place where mostly career
  women shop.  An assortment of clothes
  for the workplace hanging on racks or
  laying on shelves look chic, yet they
  appear to demand respect. The clothes
  must sell well,  because many shelves
  and racks are empty.

  These Kentuckians are dorks. They don't
  even know how to spell "corner."  Maybe
  you can use their ignorance to con them
  out of some money! The store sells very
  rustic items, such as quilts, old canes
  carved out of wood, baskets, and more.
  It is run by an old woman who needs to
  buy herself a new set of dentures.

  Very, very freakish looking people are in
  this store.  Multiple piercings and vivid
  tattoos characterize most of the shoppers
  that frequent {R,BO}Hot Topic{W,BO}.  Books of spells
  are on some shelves, along with hair dye,
  shimmering shirts, and more. The store is
  somewhat of a hybrid between {C,BO}Gadzooks{W,BO} and
  {bo,G}Spencer Gifts{W,BO}.

 {W,BO}
  A strange grinding noise can be heard as 
  you enter the room. Across the room is a
  man standing bent over a stack of wooden
  planks with a drill in his hand. He must
  be working on the new expansion project
  for the mall. As you look over the floor
  you notice that the planks aren't the
  only things with holes in them. A pile
  of human skulls with holes bored in them
  sits in a corner of the room. EEEEEKK!!!

  Most men may forget that special occasion,
