grows louder and louder until the entire anthill shudders.  From above, a
giant hand reaches down and lifts away the top of the anthill.  Attached to
the hand are the muscular arm and the body of a well-formed humanoid.  Then
you catch sight of the face--it is the hideously twisted face of the Evil
Power Master, ruler of the dark regions of the universe.

{RED}{BOLD}Entrance To The Evil Power Master's Sanctum{red}~

You have entered a place that is a tribute to all that is evil in
the universe.  This place is constructed entirely out of black
marble and murals depicting scenes of graphic violence.  As you
gaze about you, you notice nothing that is not associated with evil.
The room is enshrouded in black and illuminated only by a single
candle in the corner burning with a black flame.  The features are
so similar in every direction that you soon become disoriented.

forward.

The Nomad Temple~
   You have entered a nomad tent larger than the rest that seems to serve as
their center of worship.  You notice a crucifix on the south wall and murals
adorn the ceiling and floors in this simple, but charming temple.  A Nomad
Priest is here mumbling Gregorian chants and purifing himself with a scourge
as you enter.

The Sheik's Tent~
   You see before you a beautiful tent filled with all the riches of this
nomad kingdom.  Fluffy pillows of sheep and camel hair lie about the floor
for sitting and socializing.  A water pipe sits in the center of the room
and seems to be the only item in the room except the Sheik himself, who, at
this point, doesn't seem too happy to see you.
