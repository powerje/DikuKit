{Y}The Sands of Jacrutu{b}~

{Y}  Everywhere you look there is nothing but sand.
{Y}  The {BLU,BO}Fremen {b}{Y}have worked hard to hide this most
{Y}  sacred of sietchs. You have a feeling they do
{Y}  not want you to discover it. Even more unsettling,
{Y}  however, is the fact that {Y,BO}Worm {b}{Y}trails are visible
{Y}  throughout this area. You really hope you don't
{Y}  come across a full grown Maker.{b}

{Y}Jacrutu, the Forbidden {WH,BO}Sietch{b}~

{G}  You have finally reached Jacurutu, the fabled {WH,BO}Sietch{b}{G} that
{G}  few lay eyes on and live to tell about it. No one knows

{G}  As you walk towards the {WH,BO}Sietch{b}{G}, a massive shudder runs
{G}  down your spine. Do you really dare go up against
{G}  this demi-god that is {R,BO}Paul Muahd'ib Atreides{b}{G}, Emperor
{G}  of {R,BO}Arrakis{b}{G}, {R,BO}Mahdi {b}{G}of the {R,BO}Fremen{b}{G}?{b}
