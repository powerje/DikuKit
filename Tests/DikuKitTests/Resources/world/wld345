   As you wander these halls of darkness,

   There are those who live here, those

   {W}In the corner of the room you
   see a large dresser with a small
   jewelry kit sitting on top of it.
   Components of a make-up set are
   strewn across the room, and you
   can tell the princess never does
   her own laundry considering her
   clothes have been thrown all over
   the room! Princess indeed!
   Spoiled child is more like it!{bo}

   {C}As usual, Prince Darwin insists
   that he have the top bunk. It's
   as if it makes him "higher up".
   He seems much like the princess,
   spoiled. He also doesn't seem to
   like the idea of you being on the
   bunk with him. It's not hard to
   see why, this isn't where you are
   supposed to be. And... whoa...{bo}

   {BO,R}YUCK!! {bo,R}What's that {BO}STENCH!?{bo}
