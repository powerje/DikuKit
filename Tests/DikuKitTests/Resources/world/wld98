{BLA,BO}  styled with each figure carved of stone to depict da Vinci's{b}
{BLA,BO}  "Last Supper". Their eyes seem to follow you as you make your{b}
{BLA,BO}  way around the basin. A small trickle can be heard as it drips{b}
{BLA,BO}  from the carvings. The water has turned to sludge and is filled{b}
{BLA,BO}  with insect larva. Something just moved in the water, better do{b}
{BLA,BO}  the same before things turn bad.{b}

{BLA,BO}  Marble and ivory interchange every step heading up to the{b}

{BLA,BO}  sticks, however your sense of duty over rules it. You make your{b}
{BLA,BO}  way to the door holding on to the golden hand rails. On the{b}
{BLA,BO}  door you see a depiction of Michelangelo's "Adam the first man"{b}
{BLA,BO}  with Adam on left hand side in silver, and God on the right in{b}
{BLA,BO}  gold. In the center between the almost touching fingers is a{b}
{BLA,BO}  small indent of what looks to be a{b} {W,BO}white{b} {BLA,BO}and{b} {R,BO}red{b} {BLA,BO}interchanging{b}

{BLA,BO}  windows. A crow slams in to the window again and again till{b}
{BLA,BO}  it breaks shattering on to the foyer floor. Three crows{b}
{BLA,BO}  start swooping down on you as more start coming through the{b}
{BLA,BO}  window with many more stirring out side. Maybe that door{b}
