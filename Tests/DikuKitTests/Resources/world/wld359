   your wife hitting you across the face a few times because
   you did not take the garbage out.  The path still

   Grass grows until it is stopped by a fence.  The fence
   is guarding a building that looks to be a lab of some
   sort.  Your gut suddenly gives you an awful feeling of
   disdain.  A wolf howls in the distant hills behind you.
   You try to figure a way through the fence, but it looks
   nearly impossible to.  The links of it are made of some
   type of unknown material.  It pains you to think you
   cannot break through such a barrier.  Paths lead in a
   few directions from here, but you see no way through
   the fence from this vantage point.

  At least the scent of corpses is gone from the air.
  A mixture of rocks lay at your feet.  You kick them
  by habit.  They break apart rather easily.  The rocks
  glisten in your fire's light.  They seem to be reacting
  with it strangely.  A sudden chill just ran through 
  your body.  The path ahead seems to narrow so much

   Still the fence continues through this seemingly
   endless journey.  Small mineral deposits cover the
   ground in patches.  You have never seen such minerals
   outside of this place.  The mineral must be so rare
   that it cannot be found anywhere but here.  Maybe
   it is worth some money.  You grab a handful and toss
   it in your pouches.  This proves you have not
   learned.  A giant rock the size of a house begins to
   emerge from the ground.  It creates such tremendous
   shockwaves that you are forcedly tossed back and
   forth on the ground.  A hole that you didn't see
   before is next to a willow tree.

  {bo,CYAN}You are standing in the lobby of a very top secret
  laboratory.  A secretary observes your every motion
  while reporting it to security.  No unauthorized
  personnel will be allowed into the lab without clearance.
  A security guard grabs you by your collar, but you shake
  him off in frustration.  No one touches you like that!
  There is a room to the north that seems to be locked
  tight.  Another door is the same way to the south.{bo,cyan}

Top Secret Lab~

{CYAN}   All around you are glass windows.  They reveal
   scientists inside making concoctions and examining the
   structure of different elements.  This must be where
   everything was brought together.  The greatness of earth
   has been captured into the information these scientists
   examine.  Each room has a door with it's own label.
   These doors appear to the south, east, and west.{cyan}

  protect against the harsh and caustic elements they are
  working with.  It does not occur to them that you are
  in the room with them due to their total concentration
  on their work.  They have created some sort of being
  out of the element they were working with.  It quietly
  hovers over one of the lab tables as they discuss what
  they have created.  A straight crevice runs on the edge
  of one of the tables closest to the door.  It looks

{WHI}   You slide down a huge slippery pipe into an even larger barren
   room.  There are scratches on the wall where it seems someone
   or something has tried to claw its way out of here.  Maybe that
   should be your main concern.  The ground seems unstable as you
   walk around.  You also notice that it is a strange deep {RED}red{WHI}
   color.  You step on something very soft and {MAG}squishy{WHI}.  When you
   pull your foot back, you realize that what you stepped on was
   the {RED}heart{WHI} of a human.  This whole room is filled with the
   decaying organs of humans.  Many unfortunate souls have treaded
   into this room and lost their lives.  An accessible pipe is
   sticking out of the wall here.{whi}

Small Deposit Room~

{WHI}   You slam hard onto the unstable ground.  When you look up, you
   realize that the ground is the decayed bones of some poor souls.
   A {BLA,BO}skull{bla,bo}{WHI} stares you directly in the {GRE}eyes{WHI}.  You jump to your feet,
   startled.  Something is grabbing at your leg.  You swipe at it
   noticing it is the decaying hand of a skeleton.  A pipe is
   sticking out of the ceiling here.  You think you may be able to
   reach it.{whi}

Smaller Catacombs~
  
  
  {BLACK,BO}The room seems to shrink as you go deeper into its grasp.
  You begin to hold your breath as the air gets less and less
  bearable.  The stench from the decaying bodies is overwhelming.
  From what you can tell, there are scrawls of vicious battles
  all over the tomb covers.  The walkway continues down to the
  east.{bo,black}

Ventilated Room~

{CYAN}   There are air vents on one side of this room.  You can hear the
   air being sucked up out of the building, away from the vulnerable
   scientists working on projects.  There is a steaming pile of
   acid on a table behind you.  It is eating away at a table, yet
   it goes unnoticed by the scientists.  A bottle marked Silver
   Nitrate has carelessly been spilt on the floor.  What kind of
   dumb people work here?{cyan}

  {bo,CYAN}A {YELLOW}Bunsen burner {CYAN}is lit and is placed under a small crucible and
  cover.  You see small spattering of a solid product out from
  under the cover.  There is also a faint smell coming from it.
  You ignore it, and move along your way.{bo,cyan}

   on the other side.  A scientist is here working on a very
   important project.  The door to the glass reads {RED}WARNING{CYAN}.{cyan}

Work Station~

{CYAN}   Another counter full of supplies is here waiting to be used.
   A {WHI}metallic{CYAN} powder sits in a crucible next to a set of matches
   and distilled water bottle.  You can still hear the ventilation
   fan from a few rooms back.  The sound racks in your head like
   a grinding engine that is near its end.  You wish you could
   find what you are looking for and leave already.{cyan}

Glass Room~
  
  
  {bo,CYAN}A huge rush of air cradles your body as you enter the once
  sealed room.  It fills your lungs with burning hot moisture that
  makes you cough, and that makes it very hard to breathe.  You try to
  find an exit, but it is hard to do while you fumble on the ground
  in agony.{bo,cyan}

Janitor's Closet~

{CYAN}   Brooms lay in messy stacks next to the wall.  A huge box of
   cleaning detergent sits on a shelf above your head.  It looks very
   unstable, like it is about to fall off at any moment.  There is a
   mop bucket full of used, dirty, smelly water at your feet.  Below
   the shelf is a rack of prongs sticking out to hold up the mops
   that lay scattered on the floor.  What a lazy janitor!{cyan}

{CYAN}   The hallway curves off to the left.  The tile on the floor does not
   match up with itself anymore.  There are small triangular notches
   missing from each part of the tile.  Besides the poor quality of
   work, the floor is also cracked and rough.  The walls are still
   as narrow as before.  It makes you remember that you are alone.{cyan}

  you no feeling whatsoever.  A second look around the room
  reveals no more than a few dusty {bo,YELLOW}pennies{bo,CYAN} that have probably been
  there for a while.{bo,cyan}

  cranky too.  There are boxes stacked up around him.  The dummy must
  have stocked himself in here, and no one cared enough to look in
  the stock room.  There is a {WHITE}bright {WHITE}light{CYAN} on the ceiling with a
  metal cage protecting it from being broken.  A single string hangs
  down from it to turn it on and off.  The rest of the room cannot be
  seen due to all the boxes.{bo,cyan}

{YEL}   Watching every step very carefully, you make your way along
   the shaking earth below.  Something is protruding from the
   ground.  It looks like small beams of light.  Small pieces
   of stones and dirt vibrate along the ground and drop into
   the little holes where the light is shooting from.  It is
   making the holes larger and larger.  This is not good.{yel}

Human Research~
  
  
  {bo,CYAN}A {RED}bloody{CYAN} human body lies on the table.  It looks like
  it has been recently dissected.  The fresh smell of{RED} blood{CYAN}
  pours into your senses and rushes through your body.
  There are stains of {RED}blood{CYAN} on the wall from where it
  spattered everywhere during the disection.  A scalpel
  is sitting on the body.  Light glints off the tip of the
  scalpel into your eyes.  Just then, a scientist walks
  into the room and the door slams shut behind him.  He has
  a confused look on his face of your presence in this high
  security building.{bo,cyan}

  greet the putrid smells of bodies in the walls.  Disgusted,
  you shirk your head back only to find a skeleton fall into
  your face.  With a shriek, you arch your body sideways to
  take a swipe at it with your sword.  With a quick blow, the
  skeleton falls to the ground with a thud and cracking noises
  from the brittle bones.  You continue on, but are very
  wary of your movements.{bo,yellow}

   {BLA}Death{YEL} is in the back of your mind, especially here.  {BLA}Death{YEL}
   surrounds you.  It is impossible to escape the fact that you
   may be leading yourself to your own death.  The ground begins
   to rumble as you walk closer to the other side.  It does not
   seem completely stable.{yel}

  his chair, throwing it into the computer behind him.
  The other scientists follow his actions and reach for
  you.{bo,yellow}
