{BO,G}Lone Valley Forest{bo,g}~


  {bo,G}You are walking through a forest.  Your eyes have no 
  trouble following the trail in the faint red glow of first
  light.  The edge of the forest can be seen in the distance.
  Suddenly, something small and gray darts in front of 
  your face.{g}

{bo,G}Beneath The Willow{g}~


  {bo,G}The sights of the open plains dance tantalizing between the
  Willow's branches.  {BO,Y}Deneob {bo,G}has fully risen over the eastern hills {BO,Y}
  Ellistar{bo,G} will not rise far behind the first sun.   Suddenly the 
  trunk of the old Willow moves to block your path.  {g}

{BO,G}The Open Plains{bo,g}~


  {BO,G}Gently rolling hills glow like copper in the {Y}Deneob's {G}soft
  light.  The emerald wall of the forest, with all of its 
  seclusion, all of its protection, lay behind you.  Far to
  the east, the first glow of true dawn heralds with the rise
  of {BO,Y}Ellistar, the Golden Sun.{bo,y}

  A mist of fog covers the bay diminishing visibility to 
  only a few cubits.  Rising above the mist you see a

  {BO,W}The Holy City is beautiful.  Wide avenues run between 
  rows of well-kept townhouses.  Nearly every intersection
  is decorated with a park or a fountain.  Crystal orb-lights
  illuminate every corner, and the soft music of wind 
  chimes float in the air.{bo,w}

  You turn down a wide boulevard that leads straight for the

  a long gentle hill.  Gradually the townhouses thin out 
  and then disappear all together, replaced by a vast park
  which surrounds the foot of the Cathedral.{bo,w}

  are secure in the solidity of the crystal, but your

{BO,W}Roof of the Cathedral{bo,w}~


  {BO,W}You emerge onto the roof of the main cathedral.  Hundreds
  of people occupy the space.  It seems as though all of 
  the Holy City is gathered here arranged in a circle 
  around the central spire.  This is the celebration of the 
  Grand Vespers, introducing the first season of light.  You
  should join the ceremony and pray along with the power
  of the Creator.  The great crystal bells in the spire are 
  ringing in response to the voices around you, each sending
  a single, flawless note that echoes in the heart and 
  cleanses the soul.{bo,w}

{bo,W}The Treachery{bo,w}~
    
  {BO,W}
  It is a goblin ship, now renamed Treachery.  Just over
  fifty cubits in length, its dark black-oak frame looks 
  stained with malice, and the twin masts have awkward 
  lateen-rigged sails.  The design looks crude with the only
  hint of sleekness coming from the elongated prow with
  its fanged, serpent figurehead.
