{BOLD,RED}Ezmirelda's Lookout{bold,red}~

  You stand in the uppermost room in the tower. A large
  window looks out on Camelot. An oval mirror is on the
  wall next to the window. A vulture sits on its purch
  in the corner. The room seems to be the brewing place
  for evil and mayhem.

{BOLD,BLACK}A Stone Staircase{bold,black}~
{BO,B}
   In attempt to escape the beasts you stumble up the stone
   steps. You can feel your heart beating rapidly in your
   chest. The banshee's wails and shrilling screams are
   making your head pound. Dizzily you drag yourself up the
   staircase. You glance behind you only to find the steps
   crumbling away each step you take.

{B}
   Fleeing from the beasts you stumble into yet another room of this tower.
   This time, you feel no heat, rather the floors and walls are freezing cold
   to the touch. An opague cloud of smoke comes from the center of this large
   cavern. You approach it, curious as to its source, only to find yourself
   spralling into the back wall, landing before the altar.

   Startled and delerious you stumble into another cave which connects
   to the side of this wicked tower. Mischievous laughter echos all
   around you, and a strange pulsing heat prickles your skin. 
   Your head begins to pulse painfully, as the heat of the room 
   intensifies.

{BOLD,BLACK}The Foyer of the Wicked Tower{bold,black}~
{B}
   You have wandered into what seems to be one of the towers, 
   although its exterior is far more pleasing than what you 
   discover inside. Sweat trickles down the nape of your neck, 
   and your fingers begin to twitch as fear overcomes you. You 
   blink nervously only to find the colours that you see, are not
   tricks of your mind, but eyes aglow peering back at your intently 
   through the darkness. A shrilling scream startles you and sends 
   you flying into one of the beasts of this place. To your west, you
   notice a cave attached to the tower. A room lies to your east, 
   while a dimly lit stairway continues upward. Choose quickly which 
   way you shall pursue, for a second of hesitation could mean life
   or death.

   You have reached one of the lovely verandas built for the King and 
   Queen of Camelot. It is from here you can observe all that takes place
   over the hillsides, and market place of this magnificent city. Near the
   rail of the veranda, a couple of Queen Gwenhyfar's ladies-in-waiting sit 
   gossiping over tea. You walk towards the rail, immediately glancing down. 
   Both ivy and morning glory harmoniously have grown together on the trellis 
   that extends from the veranda to the hillside.
