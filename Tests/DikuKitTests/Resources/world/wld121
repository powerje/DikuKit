{BO}{W}Inside the {BL}Morgue{bo}{bl}~
{WHITE,BOLD}Your first reaction is to vomit as the foul smell of dead things penetrate 
your nostrils. Trying to hold your breath, you gag as you realize that
you're just sucking in this foul odor. When you get your bearings back you see
a huge table in the center of this room, and it's covered with mangled, dead body
parts. On one wall large drawers stand from floor to ceiling - large enough
to have held bodies at one time. Broken cabinets that used to hold surgical
instruments and medicine line the opposite wall. A dented suit of armor stands
in one corner. {white,bold}

hanging from the ceiling and new crystals are forming around them. Dripping
water formed a crevice in the hard sand and a small pool of water gathered
there. You might want to take a drink. But first you might want to get passed

This is the West side of the cavern. The floor slopes from West to East. As 
you look up you can see many crystals hanging from the ceiling with water

Lifting up your light, hundreds of bats that were hanging from the crystals
