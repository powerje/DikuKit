  You're standing on the branch of a huge  tree, 200'
  tall or more. The branch  is as  thick as a regular
  tree trunk.  Even taller trees surround yours.  The
  trees canopies touch one  another in  an  intricate
  aerial maze of branches and leaves.  The foliage is
  so thick that you can barely see a yard away.  It's
  impossible to see the  sky above,  even this  high. 
  The forest floor is 150' below you, lost in perpetu
  al darkness down there. A fall from here would be.. 
  ... your last one!

{W}{BO}Service Door Behind the {BLU,BO}({W}<{R}B{W}>{BLU}){blu,bo} {W}{BO}Palace{w}{bo}~


  You are behind the huge castle of <B>, in front  of
  a small door. All sort of old dancing paraphernalia
  litters the place.  They have obviously been discar
  ded by the dancers in the palace.  An aroma of beer
  and cigar smoke comes from inside.

  It is nice to have a neighbor with his own acetylene

  bench. He will get them fixed up "tout de suite."
  That is, "in no time at all!"{white}{bold}

  You are standing in a large room.  The air is musty
  and reminds you of an old basement-pub entrance. No
  furniture completes the room apart from two sofas,
  both near a fireplace.  The coat of arms of Club B
  adorns the wall above the fireplace. A statue of 
  the greatest club leader Zorro stands in the 
  middle of the room.

LXXVII~


               The nightingale has a lyre of gold,
                  The lark's is a clarion call,
               And the blackbird plays but a boxwood flute,
                  But I love her best of all.
...
               For her song is all the joy of life,
                  And we in the mad spring weather,
               We too have listened till she sang
                  Our hearts and lips together.

Byron's Love Poem : She Walks In Beauty~


               SHE walks in beauty, like the night
                  Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
               And all that's best of dark and bright
                  Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
               Thus mellowed to that tender light
                  Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
...
               One shade the more, one ray the less,
                  Had half impaired thy nameless grace,
               Which waves in every raven tress,
                  Or softly lightens o'er her face;
               Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
                   How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
...
                And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
                  So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
               The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
                  But tell of days in goodness spent,
               A mind at peace with all below,

Byron's Love Poem : So We'll Go No More A Roving~


               So we'll go no more a-roving
                  So late into the night,
               Though the heart be still as loving,
                  And the moon be still as bright.
               For the sword outwears its sheath,
                  And the soul wears out the breast,
               And the heart must pause to breath,
                  And love itself have rest.
...
               Though the night was made for loving,
                  And the day returns too soon,
               Yet we'll go no more a-roving
                  By the light of the moon.

               And Phoebus 'gins arise,
                  His steeds to water at those springs
               On chaliced flowers that lies;
                  And winking Mary-buds begin
               To ope their golden eyes;
                  With everything that pretty bin,
               My lady sweet, arise, arise;
                  Arise, arise.

  You have walked into a spacious room with glowing
  white marble floors. A spacious jacuzzi is nestled

  catches your eyes. Different pieces of armor and 
  finery are strewn about the sitting area of the

   Your eyes dilate as they strain to see a

   There is a flash of light and suddenly,
   the wall displays the words...
        "Death is watching"
   written in {RED}b{RED}{BOLD}l{bold}{RED}o{RED}{BOLD}o{bold}{RED}d{BLACK}{BOLD}. The lights fade, and you
   are again left in complete, utter darkness.
   
   Somehow, you don't feel very alone.

{BLU,BO}({W}<{R}B{W}>{BLU}){blu,bo} {WH}{BO}BloodRain's Suite No. 106 {wh}{bo}~
    
     A sense of {WHITE,BOLD}absence{g} is strongly apparent when entering
   this room. Dust has settled on the floor and the lights
   flicker before steadying as you hit the switch. The room
   seems barren, {WHITE,BOLD}abandoned{g}; your eyes search for a story
   amongst the additions left untouched.
   
     Suddenly your eyes settle on a portion of the floor that
   appears to have been cleaned; inhabited. An empty {GREEN,BOLD}Monster can{g}
   leaves a ring in the dust from where it sat. A heart has been
   drawn by someones finger. Your sense of {WHITE,BOLD}absence{g} is replaced
   by one of {RED,BOLD}longing{g} and {RED,BOLD}patience{g}.

  Finally you have found the source of all the insane

  echoed all through the club house. Near the wall, a 
  set of four enourmous speakers units, powerful amp-
  lifiers vibrates at the deafening rythm. A state of
  art sound console includes: a double turntable, ca-
  ssette and CD player.  The volume controls seem wel
  ded in the full blast position.  No hope of it get-
  ting any quieter here!

  The floor is made of black marble that gleams from
  the light of the fireplace. A king size bed made of
  some dark stone graces the west wall. The fireplace,
  also made of dark stone, is recessed into the east
  wall. A row of windows along the north wall gives
  a bird's eye view of the compound's inner courtyard.
  The center of the room contains a table and chairs
  of black lacquer wood with ornate gold scrollwork. 
  A door leads from this room into another room where
  Rhythm chooses to sleep. You notice a plaque above
  the bed.

   Such a small room, crowded with old vynil records,
   older reel-to-reel Ampex tapes, 70's catridges, ca

{BLU,BO}({W}<{R}B{W}>{BLU}){blu,bo} {W,BO}High Council Member Suite No. 302{w,bo}~


  This room seems more like the  presidential  suite 
  of a five star hotel. Two king-size beds are cove-
  red with luxurious gold-embroidered comforters. At
  the side, a large wall case shows a  rich  variety  
  of vintage wine.  Single malt Scotch  bottles  can
  be seen.  The closet is large enough to accomodate
  your weapons and armor.

{BLUE,BOLD}({WHITE,BOLD}<{RED,BOLD}B{WHITE,BOLD}>{BLUE,BOLD}) {RED,BOLD}Etak{BLACK,BOLD}'s {RED,BOLD}High Council{BLACK,BOLD} Suite No. 306{g}~
   
   You are engulfed by a strong surge of vanilla scent
   as you walk into this large room lit only by a plethora
   of candles held mounted on the wall. The walls are
   adorned in oriental markings and large decorative fans.
   A red and black conforter covers a queen-sized bed and
   flows gently on to the floor. You are filled with peace,
   serenity, and almost forget what you came in here for.

{G}The Millenary Forest Maze{g}~


  You're standing on the branch of a huge  tree, 200'
  tall or more. The branch  is as  thick as a regular
  tree trunk.  Even taller trees surround yours.  The
  trees canopies touch one  another in  an  intricate
  aerial maze of branches and leaves.  The foliage is
  so thick that you can barely see a yard away.  It's
  impossible to see the  sky above,  even this  high. 
  The forest floor is 150' below you, lost in perpetu
  al darkness down there. A fall from here would be.. 
  ... your last one!

   Many comfortable-looking beds lie on the opposite
   end of the room and the decor is stunning. You see
   the receptionist sitting at her desk with a small
   bouquet of roses in front of her. The receptionist
   flashes you a warm smile and says to you:

   "Thank you for choosing {BO,W}Club {BLU}({W}<{R}B{W}>{BLU}){bo}.
    Please enjoy your stay."
