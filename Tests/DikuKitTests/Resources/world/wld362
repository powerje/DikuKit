Courtyard~



{CYAN}
     Standing in Fort Holds main courtyard you are
     surrounded by stalls.  Every craft of Pern is 
     represented.  In the distance you see a large
     dance floor and a stage.  The smell of roasted 
     meats and sounds of merry gatherers fill the air.

Bottom of ramp~

{CYAN}         
     You are standing on the ramp that leads to Fort Hold.
     In the distance a large merry crowd is gathered in the 
     main square.  The ramp is made form rock quarried out during
     the construction of the lower Hold.  Above, the lines of 
     windows become irregular, since the rooms onto which they 
     opened were constructed not behind the curtain wall but from
     smaller, single caves.

RECORDS ROOM~


{CYAN}
    
     Fort Hold was the first hold to be established in the north.
     Good hold management requires accurate accounting of
     all goods and material used for hold purposes. 
     Valuable information is often hidden within these archives.
     The leafs within not only hold information of daily supply
     usage, but the history of Pern itself.

Crossroad~


 {GREEN}     The pathway crosses a wider road.  The view opens
      to a valley surrounded by large cliffs in the 
      distance.  Wagon wheel tracks which mark the road
      tell you that many have recently come this way.
