Link's House~
     You find your-self awakining to a soft blue dancing light.  Strange,
This light is chanting your name.  "The Great Diku Tree has sent word for 
you."  You have just been introduced to the most annoying presents
known to man as Navi.  But wait, this whole forest seems to be full of pixies.  Child like hustle and bustle can be heard 
from outside.

     This room seems to be the hollow of a giant tree stump.  Totally round, and
just one window, and a door for openings.  A small bed rests in the back, and
a round table in the middle.  Tools for yard work and of the such line the
walls, while a few pots made of clay sit on the floor.  A piece of paper on the wall catches the attention of Navi.

The Balcony Outside Link's House~
Ahh, The house is two stories tall, But no lower floor?  Well, no matter
cause standing on this balcony is not finding the Diku Tree.  Standing at this
Hight you can see The Kokiri Forest, home to the child like kokiri.  A streem
flows in the distance and other stump like homes litter the canopy's floor.
Navi Urges you to go West while your instink tells you that you should 
explore.

A young Girl with green hair and green eyes, run's in your direction.  It is
no wonder that they are so arogent and hard to see until you practicaly step
on them.  Saria Waves you down.

Kokiri Forest~
     Just look at the size of this village.  So much room for so few people.
Tiny fairy spirits flutter about, and the forest children are hiding.  But
why do they need to hide, unless danger is lerking about?  A gental breeze
blows from the East, bringing the forest smells alive.  A small streem flows
so slowly that it leaves the forest, and all the creature's feelings at an
ease.  A tiny little dirt path, in all it's complexity, leads to each of the
small stump like homes that are scattered about the region.  As Navi go's into
hiding herself, a feeling of lonlyness comes about.

Inside The Deku Tree~
     The inside of this tree stump is really much bigger than it's outward
appearence leads on.  The walls are covered in sticky giant webbing, and yes
where there are webs there are sure to be spiders.  An obvious latter leads
to the top of the stump, while curious looking hole in the floor leads to
what could be a bottomless pit, or some other danger.  Maybee as a procaution
the spiders put that sturdy web over the hole to keep others out, or even,
something in.  Deku Babas are litered all over so watch your step or become
this carnivoris plants latest snack.

Hyrule Field~
     Wow!!  This is an all new territory, and appearantly it is occupied.
There are new areas and enemy monsters all around to explore.  With the
exception of a tree every now and then, this field is mostly grass.  Dirt
Paths lead to a few land marks in the distance, to the north is a castle.
To the south is a giant lake. To the East is a smoking volcano. TO THE west
is a deasert. In the middle of this field there seems to be a ranch.
