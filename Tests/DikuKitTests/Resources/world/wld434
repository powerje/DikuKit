{Y}Before the North Gate{y}~

   {Y}You stand before the {C}North Gate{Y}, a gate which has withstood countless 
   hordes over it's 3000 year life. However, right now it is hanging from 
   it's hinges and cleaved in two. Whatever did this may still be around, 
   may be watching you, preparing to attack. You must race to the city.{y}

{Y}The Forannest{y}~

   {Y}This is the Forannest, the North Gate. It leads to the {M}Pelnnor Fields{Y},
   a span of ten or so miles between the {C}Rammas Echor {Y}and the {C}Othram {Y}which 
   protects the city of men, {W}Minas Tirith{Y}. The Forannest is also as far as
   {G}Ghan-buri-Ghan {Y}is willing to guide you. As you take leave of you guide  
   be sure to thank him heartily in the tradition of the rock loving Woses.{y}

forannest gate~

   {C}This once proud gate is barely on it's hinges. However, it yet stands between 
   you and the city. How can you get through it without damaging it further. 
                    Perhaps Ghan-buri_Ghan can help you.{c}

{R}Minor Wounds and Flesh Injuries{r}~

   {W}This ward holds those who were injured in battle or who have fallen ill 
   due to the cloud of death  spreading across the land.  To the north you 
   will find the critically injured. Those inflicted with mortal wounds or 
   wounds made be evil things.{w}

{W}The Warden's Office{w}~

   {Y}This is the office of the head healer, the Warden as the call him. Here 
   you may find herbs and medicines of all sorts. However, it is said even 
   the Warden has not heard of the healing power of the {W}Athelas {Y}plant.{y}

{W}The Sixth level of Minas Tirith{w}~

   {W}This road is resplendant with large homes and stately manors. Most of the 
   residents have either left for the shelters below or are busy boarding up 
   the homes against the coming tide of evil.{w}

{BO,R}The Stables{bo,r}~

   {Y}The horses of the errand riders are quartered here. However they are all off 
   at the moment spreading the Steward's orders to all corners of the city. Now 
   there is only one horse, {BO,C}Shadowfax{bo,c}{Y}, the last heir of the ancient Mearas, the 
   fathers of horses.{y}

{M}Far End of the Sixth Level{m}~

   {C}You are nearly at the southern most  end of the sixth tier.  Here you will 
   find {Y}Fen Hollin, the Closed Door{C}. Fen Hollin is the entrance to {Y}Rath Dinen,
   or the Silent Street{C}.  It is the way to the Hallows, the halls of the dead 
   Kings and Stewards who have ruled over Gondor in the past.{c}

{BLA,BO}Fen Hollin{bla,bo}~

   {BLA}Beyond this door is nothing but  the memories and riches of dead men. 
   Great men of old,  but dead none-the-less. Only those whose names are 
   written in the  {R}Book of Blood {BLA}may safely  enter the Hallows,  but the 
   riches and artifacts buried within are certainly worth a little {R}blood.{r}

{BLU}Into the Lamp-Lit Tunnel{blu}~

   {BLU}This tunnel is lit by hundreds of oil lamps attached to either wall. It 
   is a steep climb to the top but well worth it. At the top is the fabled 
   {W}Courtyard of the White Tree and the Citadel of Gondor {BLU}beyond that.{blu}

{W}The Base of the Embrasure{w}~

   {W}You head out onto the embrasure which faces towards Mordor. This ledge once 
   served  as a place to send signals and  communications to  {C}Minas Ithil{W}, but  
   those days are over.  {C}Minas Ithil {W}is now  {BLA}Minas Morgul {W}and will never again 
   see human masters.{w}

   likes of {BLA}Morgoth and Sauron  {W}before and it still stands.  Perhaps it will 
   stand this test as well. You will be called on to protect her soon enough.{w}

   {Y}This is the last courtyard before entering the {C}Citadel of Gondor{Y},  
   the seventh and strongest level of the city.  This courtyard is 
   home to the famed {W}White Tree of Numennor{Y}, the last descendant of 
   the great {BO,Y}Telperion{bo,y} {Y}itself.  The tree has whithered over the years, 
   the years without a king.  In the recent days the tree has shown 
   signs of renewed health.  This could only mean one thing.{y}
