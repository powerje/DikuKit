{BL,BO}that door you came through just slammed shut and automatically
{bo}{RE}locked. Well damn! Looks like that fire escape is the only way

plummet, the old joke of a man falling and saying as he passes 
floors "so far, so good" comes to mind. Now would be a good

petty thieves to super-villains this bank has seen it all.
Crooks looking to score it big go time after time to the

clean with the money. In fact, after a peek through the 
windows you can see some people on the floor, in the midst
of a full blown bank robbery.

{MAG}The {BLU}NYC{MAG} Sewer System{magenta}~
{WH}It's pitch black down here, and there's no way to tell
which way you're going. A thin layer of slime covers
the floor, the sound of running water reaches your ears
from the distance, but with all the twisting tunnels and
echos there is no way to tell where it originates from.
Critters bump into your feet as you make your way through
the darkness. Believe me, you don't really want to know
what that squishy thing you just stepped on was.

In the chill of the night, at the scene of a crime.
 Like a streak of light, he arrives just in time.
