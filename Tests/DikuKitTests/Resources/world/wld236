Salt Spray~

     You are alongside of a large boat. You are caught in the
bow wake and the sea foam sprays in your face. The sides are
very high and you wonder if you can make it onboard. You see
some writing high above you on the side of the boat.....

and recording. In front of you is the sparc workstation
recording and processing all of the important data. On 
another small table is yet another computer that controls
the communication relays. The technology in here is totally
amazing and you cant wait to play with it all. You hope the

other side of you is the spinning reels of cold wet steel
10 feet tall. Wrapped around the reels are the massive nylon
nets used to catch the vast amounts of fish. You are as far 
back on the boat as you can get without being caught in the 
nets. Dont fall in!

are on the stove and steam rises out of them. The smells of
delicious food asails your senses. The aromas make you think
of food. You are hungry.

The Storage Room..~

     You have passed through a bulkhead door and are now
standing before a ladder. In piles on the floor are the
sacks that contain the "Gumby Suits". These are the bright
orange survival suits used to keep you alive if you should
have to abandon the ship. They are awkward and you will look
funny in it but it will protect you from the harsh and often
fatal environment of the North Atlantic.

ladder here leading upwards. Pipes and other ship workings
are visible here. Grease and saltwater mix at your feet and

The Wet Lab~

    You have entered a small cozy wet lab. Here you see 
specimen jars and a large sink with sieves in it. In the
corner is a large jug filled with formalyne to perserve the
specimens. You see a sturdy microscope and a light tray.
Sheets of paper, most likely bio-workup sheets, are lying
here. Also on the long work bench are disecting tools and 
some writing implements. On a shelf above the bench are
many volumes on marine life. Hanging on the walls are people's
wet gear as well as boots lying about. Water sloshes around your
feet. Hunched over the light tray is a large man. He appears 
to be sorting through plankton samples looking for larval 
fish. He sways with the boat as it rocks back and forth.
Try not to disturb him he looks very busy.

array hangs over the side here and you see its cable cuttin
through the water. Before you lies a 180 degree panoramic
view of the great deep blue Atlantic ocean. From your 
vantage point you can see dolphins playing and ships passing
by. The sun sets and rises and you watch this beautiful site
all from this special place. At night you can watch the full
moon cast shadows on the waves as the pilot whales swim 
gracefully alongside the boat.

boat gently sways in the high sea swells and you sway 
with it as it rolls. I hope you have your sea-legs now
because there is nothing close for you to grab.

other side of you is the spinning reels of cold wet steel
10 feet tall. Wrapped around the reels are the massive nylon
nets used to catch the vast amounts of fish. You are as far 
back on the boat as you can get without being caught in the 
nets. Dont fall in!

The Side Rails~
     You are almost there! From here you can see the open
Foredeck. Soon you won't have the safety of the rails to
hold onto. You will be on your own. Watch your step and
enjoy the view.

The rails~

     You didn't slip! You are now walking on the narrow
piece of deck alongside the main bridge. This path will
lead you to the bow of the ship. Be careful though, it 
is slippery and precarious here.

The small ladders~

     Before you is a small two step ladder built into
the bulkhead of the ship. Be careful as you step here
you might slip and fall into the sea.

Propellers Of Death~

     You get sucked into the propellers and get chopped 
to pieces. You are now shark chum.
