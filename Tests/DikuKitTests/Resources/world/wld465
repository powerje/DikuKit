Light~

{BLACK,BOLD} You've made it out of the tunnels. There are elites and grunts
{BLACK,BOLD} flooding the hallways making sure no one gets past.
{BLACK,BOLD} There is a way out to the west, but you better be careful
{BLACK,BOLD} as you move. There are many of them and they are alert.
{BLACK,BOLD} The leader stands here telling them all what to do.{black,bold}

Burnt room~

{BLACK,BOLD} So much plasma fire in this room that it caused some barrels
{BLACK,BOLD} to explode leaving the room in ruins. This is where they stored
{BLACK,BOLD} possesions of marines that lived here. On the floor you see a
{BLACK,BOLD} picture of a family all smiling. To the south you sense that
{BLACK,BOLD} it will explode at any minute. You decide it isn't wise to go
{BLACK,BOLD} in. To the west, is where the fire started.{black,bold}
