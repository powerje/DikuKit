   {WHITE}Welcome to Victor's Hotel D' Royal.
   The entrance seems to be blocked off...
   You'll have to find another way to get in...
   I'm sure you can manage.
   Please enjoy your stay.{bo}

   {bo,CYAN}Here you are at the reception of
   this not-so-luxurious hotel.

   {BO,CYAN}In fact, it's disgusting you so
   much that you just can't wait to
   get out of here.

   {bo,CYAN}Hurry up and type rent...
   Seeing as the receptionist looks
   stressed out of her mind, I'm sure
   she'd be ecstatic to see you
   leave this world behind...
   Or at least for a while.{bo}

{BO,MAGENTA}Remembrance of Nixdorf{bo}~

  {bo,CYAN}There is a statue here,
  commemorating the efforts
  of Nixdorf, one of the finest
  mudders Northern Crossroads has
  ever come into contact with.

  {BO,CYAN}In fact, his great great great
  great great grandson (who really
  isn't all that great) continues
  to play here.

  {bo,CYAN}Nixdorf is living to the north of here...
  Go pay him a visit!{bo}

   {CYAN}You're safe it seems...
   Or at least for the time being.

   But in this corner of the galaxy...
   How safe could you possibly be?{bo}

   {CYAN}You've entered a dense cloud
   out in space. The blinding fog
   which seems to be covering whatever
   atmosphere that exists seems to
   absorb light, and you can't help
   but wonder what that might mean.

   can't really say it's vertical,

   The birth of the world as you see it,

   The stars reach farther than the

   can hear the voices of sit-com
   stars getting ready for their next
   big show.

   It's rumoured that nearby there
   is a cook that can whip up some
   delicious dishes. Maybe you could
   go grab a bite to eat?{bo}

   of getting a bite of that succulent
   treat which the chef must be quite
   busy perfecting.

   Of all the problems in the
   world, you had to be blocked
   off by a stupid wall!

   {MAGENTA}But that won't stop you,
   ohh no...  There's got to
   be some way to get around it.
   Or you could always just explore
   the rest of the zone instead of
   wasting your time here. There's

   the dark alley. To the east you find
   the infamous wall road, and to the
   west continues the dark alley. As
   you go farther along, you'll find the
   poor alley and many other recognizable
   areas.

   {MAGENTA}Wander around, have fun!
   That's what this zone is all about
   isn't it?{bo}

   the levee...  But, the river's
   dried up, so they took it down.

   up all the water...
   Could it be true?{bo}
