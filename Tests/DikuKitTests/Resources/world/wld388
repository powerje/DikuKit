{WH,BO}Rueggan's Elevation Contraption{wh,bo}~
{W,BO}
  This has got to be one of Rueggan's greatest inventions
  yet. This box constructed from snow-fire stone uses the 
  power of the krystals, actually elevates its users to a 
  higher level in the Obelisk. Its ride is smooth and short.
  What a lifesaver when bringing heavy spell books down from
  the library!

{CY,BO}Entrance to Storage{cy,bo}~
{C,BO}
  Snow-fire stone was used on both the interior and 
  exterior walls at this level. The inner walls seem 
  to glow with a bright white light. At the entrance
  to the storage area, a master wizard stands post 
  ensuring that only those that have permission to 
  enter the storage area do.

{CY,BO}Storage Room{c,bo}~
{WH,BO}
  The storage room is quite large and covers the
  entire level. To the west is a small pile of
  krytals and next to that another. In fact, 
  krystals are piled all around the room. At the
  door the Master Wizard motions to the pile
  directly to the north. This is the oldest pile
  and should be used before the energies are
  naturally expended.

  The snow-fire stone shines a bright red colour as

  be something of value.

  Good thinking! Some of the greatest spell-casters
  with a more inventive flare have discovered the
  Obelisk's hidden workshops. The shops are up the
  shaft just behind the elevation contraption. Tucked
  out of sight and out of sound range, great inventors
  like Rueggan can work without interruption.

  A large sign hangs from the gate. Above it is

  place. Don't stand here too long. Read the sign
  and move on. Standing here could result in

  Most every structure has a functional side. The Landing 
  is just that for the obelisk. Here, the krystals are
  shipping in via dragon from all over the land and 
  deposited in the store room. If it weren't for these
  large, winged creatures, Krystonia would function far
  less efficiently. The landing itself is nothing more
  than a giant slab of snow-fire stone accented with
  keldorr wood doors and supports.

{BL,BO}Behind the Krystallate Obelisk{bl,bo}~
{BL,BO}
  In the shadows for the great Krystallate Obelisk,
  there is a hidden stairway. From afar it can't be
  seen and if standing right next to it, it can be
  easily overlooked. The design is attributed to the
  mechanical abilities of the great Rueggan. He and
  Azael worked long and hard to create the perfect 
  system to allow for krystal deliveries to remain 
  as undetected as possible. With this hidden stair-
  case, the Om-ba-Don and Maj-Dron aid the dragons 
  in krystal transport.

  Ingenius! That's exactly what this is! Who would
  ever have guessed that this was here!? The canopy
  overhead is constructed of snow-fire stone and 
  blends into the side of the Obelisk. Whether 
  standing directly next to it or at a distance the
  architecture is flawless and conceals the stairway
  up to the loading dock. The krystals will remain
  safe here.

{WH,BO}Rueggan's Elevation Contraption{wh,bo}~
{W,BO}
  This has got to be one of Rueggan's greatest inventions
  yet. This box constructed from snow-fire stone uses the 
  power of the krystals, actually elevates its users to a 
  higher level in the Obelisk. Its ride is smooth and short.
  What a lifesaver when bringing heavy spell books down from
  the library!

{C}Picture Window{c}~

  Stepping off the elevator, there is a fabulous picture window
  overlooking all of Krystonia. Standing there often elicites
  sighs of immense awe as the onlooker realizes just how marvelous
  a place it is. At the same time, reality sets in and the importance
  of the Krystallate Obelisk become apparent. With so much to do
  in the day ahead, retiring to the comfortable acoomodations 
  provided may not be such a bad idea.

{R}The Majestic Room{r}~
{R}
  This room is so named because Groc thought it was
  the most majestic room he had ever seen. In the 
  center of the far wall sits a gigantic bed of 
  feathers and silk pillows. Each one was hand stitched
  by the ladies of Krystonia who were all to happy 
  to lend a hand in decorating the Krystallate Obelisk.
  The silks are the finest in the land and coloured in
  reds, purples, and tans. The floor is covered in the
  thickest, plushest carpets ever made. A beautiful 
  bubble bath sits waiting for guests to enjoy a soak.

  A child's dream come true or the comfort of home away

  two tall trunks which seem to grow out of the floor and 
  straight up to the ceiling where the branches disappear.
  On the east side of the room, a soft bed has been made 
  between four smaller trunks. The leaves and branches create
  the canopy cover over the bed. A large pile of leaves,
  some ropes, and a tire swing add to the enjoyment of the
  room

  The room senses that someone has entered and immediately

  troubles with large warm pools of bubbling spring water.
  While others insist that the room has a heavy mist which
  envelops the guest and carries his off in weightless
  dreams. Yet, others tell the story differently. If the
  guest does not mind a mystery, this is the room of choose.

  Never has the world seen such a marvelous display of light. 
  Entering the room, all eyes are immediately drawn in by the
  six foot prism suspended in the center of the room. A small
  beam of light passes through the bottom of the prism which 
  then casts rainbows of coloured light into the high ceiling.
  Falling softly over the room as the colours reflect off the
  angled ceiling panels, it is hard to discern what colour the
  walls and furniture truly are. This room is favoured above 
  the other suites as it is said to let the mind travel beyond
  natural borders.

  Getting caught in fire thorns or rose bushes isn't
  a good idea. There are strange sounds coming from 
  underfoot. Though the beast can't be seen, it's 
  surely there. A large tree with black and red bark
  captures the attention of all as a thought enters
  your mind... Can I hide in it?

  Deep in the Forest of Keldorran, the Keldorr and Cudha 
  trees grow taller still. The width of the great Keldorr
  hollowed out makes a great place to live or hide. Under 
  the musty, mossy canopy of a Cudha, it is not uncommon
  to find a krystal or two. Still, off the main path of

  Standing outside of the cavern of the President of Dragon
  Transport and the Dragon Transport office, there seems to 
  be a lot of traffic. Dragons of all shapes and sizes are
  sitting around laughing and carrying on in this large
  opening in the caves. Looking up, this place would require 
  a winged dragon to reach the ceiling. It seems to be almost
  as wide as it is tall. Though it contains no human comforts

{BL,BO}The Caves of Cairn Tor{bl,bo}~
{BL,BO}
  Not every dragon has his own cave like Grunch.
  Some dragons just crash here or there and huddle
  together to keep the cool breeze from freezing
  their tails off. A sleeping dragon is not something
  that should be bothered.
