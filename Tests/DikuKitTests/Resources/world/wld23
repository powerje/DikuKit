Inside a tavern~
You are inside a dimly-lit room. The atmosphere makes you feel uncomfortable. 
In front of you stands a mysterious looking gypsy. She whispered 'Your fate and
destiny lie beyond this world.' You are still wondering what she means when you
suddenly notice the crystal ball...It glows fiercely and displays the Universe!

Inside the galaxy~
You are now inside the galaxy, around you you see stars and nebulae smiling at 
your presence, and comets and meteors wandering around you. You realize that 
this world may not be the true galaxy afterall, but just another fantasy zone. 
Exits lie virtually in all directions.
