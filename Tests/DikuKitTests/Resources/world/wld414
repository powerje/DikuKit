{R}The Siege of Tolkeen{r}~
{R}
   As you step through the Rift, you are hurled through space
   and time!  After a rough landing, you adjust your eyes to
   take in the sights around you.
 
   It appears that you are still in the Magic City of Tolkeen,
   but the beautiful buildings and monuments you saw before
   are now crumbling and ablaze!  The City of Tolkeen is 
   under siege!

   You are now standing before a large pyramid, used to focus the power

   allowed Tolkeen to harness limitless magical energy, enough to power
   the entire city for centuries.
 
   Now, the grand pyramid is merely a burned-out husk, ravaged by 
   Coalition bombardments.  The magical ley lines now surge out of 
   control, gradually destroying what the enemy did not.

{M}The Coming of the Rifts{m}~
{M}
   At some point in time, on a calendar long since abandoned,
   the human race was in a glorious age of technological splendor.
   The power of the atom had been conquered.  Medical technology
   could double life expectancy, or create super-soldiers of 
   unmatched power via chemical or cybernetic enhancements.  The
   far reaches of this galaxy had been explored, and life was
   comfortable and easy.
 
   But the various empires of the world could not work in harmony.
   War escalated on an unprecedented scale, and a bizarre chain of
   events would bring back the power of magic to the world.  Then
   came the bombs, though nobody was sure who fired first.  The 
   simultaneous release of life energy all over the world merely
   fed the magic with more energy, and the long-dormant ley lines
   flared to life, perpetuating the chain of death and anarchy.

{M}The Dark Ages{m}~
{M}
   The survivors of the Rifts found life difficult.  With the
   return of magic came the return of magical beings as well.
   Demons, dragons, and the ancient races of magic slowly
   returned to the land.  The Rifts brough other uninvited
   guests as well - transdimensional beings and aliens, like
   the insect-like Xiticix.
 
   The pockets of humanity remaining strived to survive in these
   hard centuries.  Many unearthed the technological machines of
   old, like the Coalition States.  Others learned to harness
   the powers of magic and the Rifts, like the communities of
   Lazlo and Tolkeen.

{M}History Repeats...{m}~
{M}
   Several decades ago, the fledgling Coalition States waged a war with
   the evil wizards of the Federation of Magic.  The Coalition barely
   survived the ordeal, while the Federation was all but crushed.  As
   a result of their near demise from the hands of magic users and 
   demons, the Coalition States started down the road of anti-magic 
   sentiments and human supremacy.  Their views eventually became so
   polarized that they saw all magic, magic wielders, and supernatural
   creatures as evil blights on the planet.
 
   So ends the lesson.  History continues to unfold as we speak.

   You are walking through a narrow corridor, most
   likely an escape route for the King and his
   entourage in case of an emergency.  It's damp, 
   cold, and very dark.

{BLU,BO}Treasure Chamber{blu,bo}~
{BLU,BO}
   You've stumbled upon the King's hidden treasure chamber!
   Various antiques line the walls, and many spell books sit
   on the shelves.  In the center of the room, sits a lone
   pedestal; something of great importance must have been
   placed there, but it's gone now.

   This pyramid has been laid to waste by the Coalition

   Explanation - 
 
   Since this room will never be seen by a mort, and rather than
   have to explain it over and over, this desc. describes how it
   works.  This room has 4 1-way links, to rooms 41487-41490.
   There's a key mob here, that wanders.  When the zone pops, 
   he'll end up walking to one of the 4 rooms, and won't be able
   to come back here.
 
   In other words, the key and key mob will randomly end up in
   1 of 4 areas of the zone, and it'll be up to the morts to find
   which one.  Cool, eh?

   You are now standing in Wildstar's eternal shrine to his
   time as a Beta Tester for FFXI.  This quaint Mog House 
   features a sturdy Maple Table in the center of the room,
   with various maps, a Chocobo License, and a Magicked Skull
   resting atop it.  A suit of Centurion Scale Armor rests in 
   one corner, and mounted on the walls are the weapons used 
   to battle the Beastmen of Vana'diel.  A small but deadly
   Decurion's Dagger, a Royal Footman's Bow, a Legionaire's 
   Scythe, and the powerful Centurion's Sword are all 
   displayed proudly here.
