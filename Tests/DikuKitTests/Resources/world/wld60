   {GR,BO}You are standing at the eastern edge of a big
   forest.  To the east is the West Gate of Midgaard
   and to the west is a narrow trail, leading in

   north with little weird mushrooms.  You can hear
   the faint sound of some small voices singing.  To 
   the south is a wide path running along the edge of
   the forest.{green,bo}

The Woodsman~


   You are in the common room of the Woodsman.  A
   thin haze of smoke sits in the air here. People
   are all about eating, drinking, but mostly just
   talking in as loud a voice as possible.
   Everything seems quite friendly. The bar
   is just north of here.  To the east, you catch
   a glimpse of a man waving for you to come to
   him. If you'd rather have your own table, one
   is just being vacated to the south.{bo}

The Ambush Point~


   This is an overgrown foot-trail south of the inn.
   It leads west, but you would be hard pressed to
   follow it far. A young boy sits here on the dirt,
   nursing his many bruises and cuts. He looks glad
   to see you.{bo}

The Bar~


   Many people sit here, enjoying the food, drink
   and hospitality of the innkeeper. If you do not
   like the regulars here, you can leave south and
   return to the common room.  As you look at the
   various drinks and dishes other people have,
   the innkeeper comes up to you, smiles and gives
   a hardy, What may I do for you stranger?{bo}

This man smiles at you and seems quite happy. You realize that you can
talk to him by typing 'look at <word>' where word is a one word topic
you'd like to discuss.

He seems delighted that you want to talk to him.  My name is Andros.

Why I am the Innkeeper, of course.  Andros chuckles.

Andros frowns, well to be quite honest, we've been having a bit of
trouble with some unknown strangers lately. They've been coming in here
now and then looking for an old man with a SWORD.

The Bard's Table~


   A melancholy man sits here in a dirty cloak and
   boots.  He is nursing a liquor so strong you can
   smell it from where you are standing. He motions
   you to sit with him and listen to his exciting
   stories.{bo}

E
bard man melancholy~
He looks sad, as of he has just borne a great loss.  Also, by the
condition of his clothes, you can tell he has been travelling a long
time through rough terrain.
~
E
name~
He sighs, My name is Rescuer, but I am afraid it is a deceiving name.
~
E
job profession work~
I used to be a traveling bard.  I was on a quest with Questor.  Questor
and I found a sword called the Sword of Fury.  This is a very powerful
weapon.  Unfortunately Questor got kidnapped by a group of mysterious
people and headed toward the Ambush Point.  I'm too old to do anything
about it now.....
