{C,BO}Before {Y,BO}The {W,BO}Cross{w,bo}~
{WHITE}You sense a great holyness within this room.
You notice many pictures of saints that have lived in the passed.
The walls are painted with gold and glow with a placid vibrance
of light that can only be emitted from the{WHITE} {YELLOW}Heavens{YELLOW} {WHITE}above.  Before you,
stands the cross in which{WHITE} {YELLOW}Jesus Christ{YELLOW} {WHITE}our Lord and Savior died on.
As you meditate upon the cross you can almost glimps the{WHITE} {YELLOW}Angels{YELLOW} {WHITE}rejoicing,
you can almost see and sense a small portion of{WHITE} {YELLOW}Heaven{YELLOW}{WHITE}.
The thought instantly brings you to tears of joy.  For anyone that kneels
in prayer at the cross, remember that he died, he rose from the grave, and
he will come again{WHITE}{YELLOW}!{YELLOW}
