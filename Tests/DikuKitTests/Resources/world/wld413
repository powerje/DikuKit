{W}Gatehouse of Mithril's Palace{w}~

  You walk underneath a huge stone arch into the gatehouse, 
  where you see an enormous {WHITE}gate{white} made of some glimmering
  metal.  There is a small {CYAN}guardhouse{cyan} to the west.  The
  gate is open since there is nothing to fear under Mithril's 
  protective power.

gate~

  {WHITE}Mithril's Gate{white} -- You have never seen anything like this gate 
  before.  It seems impenetrable, yes it is shiny and polished.  
  You cannot find a nick or a dent on the surface.  Runes and 
  sigils of the Dwarven language are etched into the gate, but
  they feel smooth as if they were engraved through mystical means.

guardhouse~

  The {CYAN}guardhouse{cyan} is now a small museum with its contents
  visible from the gate.  It is full of weapons that tell the
  history of the Dwarves and other warrior races.  You would like
  to give some of them a try, but you would never be able to get
  through those bars.

  While in Lankhmar, be aware that you are in a city ruled by

  Actually, they will relieve you of *all* your money and equipment
  if they can, so pay attention to whose hands are in your pockets!.

  | {BL,BO}Nest{bo,C} in the southwest.  While the "Eel" is one of the rare

  | the "Nest", where the scum of the world come to rob and kill
  | each other.
  |
  | If you have a more refined palate, you might prefer the

  North of here is a tavern that looks as though it has
  seen much better days.  There is no sign on the tavern
  other than a stained plaque with a picture of a rat 
  sitting on an egg...how peculiar!

{Y,BO}Temple of the {W}Gods of Lankhmar{w,bo}~
  
  {BL,BO}Your skin begins to crawl as you make your way into the temple
  of the {R}Gods of Lankhmar{BL}.  This room is the antechamber to the
  actual temple, into which it is certain death to enter.
  
  This chamber is designed for sacrificing to the Gods.  Patrons who wish
  to appeal to the Gods can leave items they wish to curry favor with.
  The items are sealed in the chamber at night and they are always
  gone in the morning.  Whether the Gods actually use their influence
  is another matter entirely.
  
  This room is covered on walls, ceiling, and floor with hieroglyphic 
  sigils.

  Priests of all the Gods in Lankhmar wander here, but you can
  tell that they barely tolerate each other, and there is no 
  conversation in the street.
  
  {BL,BO}North of you is a sinister, squat building made from some 
  peculiar jet black material.  Just looking at the building makes 
  you quiver with wonder and terror.  The street continues to the
  east, where you can barely make out the Marsh Gate at the very end
  of the street.

  exquisite examples of the finest works of gem craft, all locked 
  behind steel mesh and glass cabinets.
  
  Jengao's is considered by some to be the finest jeweler in 
  Lankhmar, and is personally responsible for arraying the city
  royalty and maintaining their marks of state and other baubles.
  
  Most Lankhmarians really know that Jengao is a thief, and has been
  making off with city property for years.  Nonetheless, you are
  enchanted by the beauty of the precious stones you see all about you.

  {BL,BO}This area is the only place of worship in Lankhmar that is off the
  Street of the Gods.  It is a peculiar shrine in the middle of the 
  intersection with a statue in the center.  
  
  This statue is made of a shiny black substance the looks like onyx.  
  It is in the shape of a lovely young woman who is nude, but discreetly
  covering herself with her hands.  
  
  All around the shrine are the Priestesses of the Virgin who offer
  their virginity to the High Priest as part of their vows.  They carry
  razor-sharp daggers of an unknown black metal and are renowned for
  being extremely fierce warriors.

  paintings depicting war and hunting scenes, and various implements
  used for both.
  
  The priests and priestesses of Kos are a sharp contrast to the
  pristine surroundings.  They are all arrayed in animal skins that
  seem to be crawling with fleas and other vermin.  Obviously these
  clerics don't bathe very often either...

{Y,BO}The Golden Lamprey{y,bo}~
  
  {Y,BO}The Lamprey is one of the premier wine sellers in a city that 
  is known for its obsession with alcohol.  In this shop, you can find
  some of the finest spirits from all over the face of the Nehwon map.
  
  They carry every imaginable sort of spirit here, from the snow potato
  brandy drunk by the hero Fafhrd's northern clan to the sweet and heady
  dessert wines that are a specialty of the Tovilyis region.
  
  Also sold here is the mushroom wine of Quarmall, which is said to
  foster visions in those who are in tune with the supernatural.
  
  By far the finest vintage are the light and bubbly wines of the 
  Ilthmar regions, across the south-eastern sea.  It is said these
  wines are not only delicious, but have curative properties as well.

  At one end of the plaza is the {M}Fountain of Dark Abundance{BL}, which

{Y,BO}Temple of {C}Beasts{c,bo}~
  
  {C}This is a rather unusual temple.  It is dedicated not to one single
  god, but to a whole bevy of divine animals.  The adherents to this
  religion believe that of every type of animal, there are thirteen of
  the species that are 'perfected'.  These creatures are endowed with
  special powers such as speech, and delivery of blessings of good
  fortune.
  
  The perfect beasts are depicted in beautiful tapestries, feather 
  weavings and every other kind of imaginable medium.  The altar
  in the temple here is covered in dried grass and adorned with fruit
  and vegetables, as the eating of meat is prohibited by this cult.

  image is to be found.
  
  Rumor has it the Guild of Pimps is secretly operated by the
  Cult of Illala from behind the scenes.  That might account for 
  the lavish furnishings here, all in {W}silver {M}and {W}platinum {M}bedecked
  with beautiful gems and stones.
  
  Each of the priestesses are exquisite beauties, arrayed in white

  only a few people wandering around.
  
  You are drawing ever nearer to the eastern wall of the city, 
  where you can dimly see soldiers patrolling.

{BL,BO}Altar of {R}Hates{r,bo}~
  
  {R,BO}The altar is a flat plate of black volcanic rock, surrounded
  by the priests of the Hates, robed in black and purple.  They
  are quietly chanting a powerful spell in unison.  As you stand there,
  you see a reddish fog appearing over the altar, which seems to 
  be formed from innumerable ectoplasmic tendrils.
  
  Within the fog, you can see eyeballs floating inside, peering 
  about the room.  The Fog is connected to the altar by a thick red
  cord of some sort, but is beginning to move about the room.
  
  The tendrils are moving about and grabbing up the various rusty
  and bloody weapons scattered over the altar.  Then you see its 
  eyes focus squarely on you...your blood turns to ice...

{Y,BO}Temple of {C}Issek of the Jug{c,bo}~
  
  {W}There are many gods named Issek, but this one is the most 
  influential and powerful.  He is a god of peace and perseverance
  whose popularity skyrocketed when the hero Fafhrd broke his
  sword and joined his cult.
  
  Issek would travel the world preaching powerful sermons of 
  brotherhood in poetic stanzas.  He was captured and ordered to be
  put to death by torture, but would not succumb.  He was placed on
  the 'rack' to be tortured, but broke seven racks before his body
  finally gave way on the eighth.  Issek broke loose and took the 
  brass collar from his torturers neck and fashioned it into a jug
  before his spirit sped away.  It is said that Issek's jug can
  be made to produce endless quantities of any desired liquid.
  
  Issek's fame peaked when Fafhrd unwittingly re-enacted his second 
  coming before a large crowd.

{W}Street of the Gods{w}~
  
  {C}This is the {BO}Street of the Gods{bo,C} that runs along the northern
  perimeter of Lankhmar.  Unlike the rest of the city, this street
  is paved with smooth white stones and lit with lamps and torches.
  Priests of all the Gods in Lankhmar wander here, but you can
  tell that they barely tolerate each other, and there is no 
  conversation in the street.
  
  {W}Just north of you is a temple that looks a little peculiar.
  It looks like it is undergoing some sort of renovation, and you 
  suspect that a new god is moving in to a temple of one that fell 
  out of favor.  On the door, the original sigil is covered up, and 
  a crudely painted picture of a clay water jug wrapped in broken
  chains.

  {W}Carter Street is one of the cleaner and well-apportioned districts
  of the city.  The streets are well kept, and there doesn't seem to be 
  many bandits here.  At least you think so.
  
  Carter Street is where all the nicer inns and hostels in the city are.
  It is known also for its fine restaurants as well as the wandering
  musicians and other performers.

  {BL,BO}As you enter this alley, you get the sensation that there are
  black birds flapping all around you, obscuring your vision and filling
  your ears with their evil cries.
  
  The flock begins to part, and you can see a woman there in purple
  robes with huge black wings sprouting from her back.  Her long
  fingernails, which are more like talons, are bloodstained.  
  
  She opens her mouth to speak, but you hear only her commands to her
  flock to be silent while she ponders your fate.  Perhaps you 
  shouldn't have visited this alley after all...

{W}The Marsh Gate{w}~
  
  {W}This is the gate that leads to the {C}Sinking Lands{W}, which 
  is an isthmus that provides access to the mainland of Nehwon.  
  
  This is the way that adventurers exit the city - beyond these
  gates you will have access to the wild lands, the desert, the
  frozen northlands and other dangerous places to travel.
  
  Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser have walked through this gate many
  times, to visit their mentors: Ningauble of the Seven Eyes and
  Sheelba of the Eyeless Face.  
  
  But you won't be walking through today.  The nobles of the city
  have ordered that this gate be sealed, so you will have to wait
  to explore these amazing places...it will be worth it for those
  who can survive.
