Rith's Hermitage~
{Y}
  Welcome to{y} {MAG,BLI,BO}Rith's Hermitage{mag,bli,bo}{Y}, high up on fabled Mt. Kadr. To
  have reached this point, you must be either very strong, very
  lucky...or an Immortal.{y}
{Y}
  This very place is where Rith comes to spend some time alone
  after a long day. The floor is bare, except for a{y} {MAG,BO}cushion{mag,bo}{Y} near
  the far end, and a{y} {GREEN,BO}grass mat{green,bo} {Y}in the far corner. Numerous weapons
  are hanging up on the walls, some recognizable, some rather
  exotic. Rith keeps his most favored weapon well out of reach of
  mortals, who could easily hurt themselves with it...{y}
{Y}
  Rith lives a peaceful life here, alone.

{WHI,BO}A vibrating field...{whi,bo}~
{GR}  
  This is the center of the field. The number of
  these{gr} {WHI,BO}little white orbs{whi,bo} {GR}seems endless as you
  survey the land. To the north, south, east, and
  west, you can see openings in the encompassing
  forest. The openings don't look very inviting.
  They are dark and gloomy-looking. But, as there
  seems to be no other way into the otherwise
  impenetrable wall of trees, one of those openings
  must be the exit out of this endlessly-shaking
  field.

  Strange. This section of the forest is remarkably
  quiet. The constant trembling of the earth seems
  distant as well. The silence is almost eerie, but
  it is quickly cut off by a VERY loud snorting noise!
  It seems whatever is in these woods has found you!
  Turning to look, you gaze upon the largest{gr} {Y,BO}Hippo{y,bo}{GR}
  you have ever seen. This{gr} {Y,BO}Hippo{y,bo} {GR}could easily tear
  this entire forest apart, and you with it. However,
  it seems to be asleep, and snoring. It's mouth is
  shut very tight as it breathes through its nostrils,
  and you wonder if it could be hiding anything...

  You are gazing at the enormous Hippo's mouth.
  It is sealed very tightly, almost like the
  Hippo is experiencing some discomfort. You
  feel the urge to get a peek at what is inside
  his massive jaws, but first you are going to
  need some way to coax his mouth open...

  can tell that this Hippo is obviously made of some

  the outside...
  
  Bright light shines up ahead, and you determine
  that you are almost out of the yellow tunnel. What

  A soft breeze whispers lightly against your
  cheek. Birds twitter nearby. You can hear
  the faraway sounds of children at play. You
  close your eyes and soak in the peace. Smiling,
  you gaze up...and up, and up, and UP! There
  are multiple platforms stacked right above the
  one you are standing on! And there is nothing
  holding them up! Turning back toward the tunnel,
  you find it has vanished...no escape that way.
  
  Taking another look at your surroundings, you
  see that connected to each platform are randomly
  placed ladders and slides. But what mysterious
  force could be holding the thing together?

  Pausing to take a breather for a while, you once
  again turn your gaze toward the platforms above
  you, wondering with renewed curiosity how it is
  possible for them to remain standing in mid-air.
  There are no supports around, only the ladders
  and slides you've seen before. Asking these
  questions unfortunately does not provide you
  with any answers, but as you bring yourself back
  to this floor, you notice the end of a rather long
  slide in this area.

  You are now standing upon the first floating
  platform. It seems sturdy enough. In fact, the
  ground beneath your feet doesn't move even the
  tiniest bit. A breeze is blowing all around you,
  yet the platform does not sway or tremble at all.
  
  Looking down, you notice that you are standing
  in mid-air! You quickly run to stand on the edge
  of the platform and look down. It's a long way
  to the bottom! You put your foot over the hole
  you came up through and press down lightly. Your
  foot hits the air like solid ground. It isn't 
  clear what unusual forces are at work in this
  area, but clearly what goes up does not go back
  down.
