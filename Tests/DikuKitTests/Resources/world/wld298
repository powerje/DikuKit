{GREEN}Path of the Ferns{green}~

    From out of nowhere a springy path jumps into sight. It
is full of a vibrant green fern-like plants and this gives
it the springy feel that is so comforting. Both sides of 
the path are lined by thick impenetrable trees that climb
far above almost seeming to challenge the darkening sky. 
The land here is green yet the taint of winter is arriving 
with autumn and the cold fingers of snow will soon embrace
all. Peering upwards and through the thick limbs you 
notice small flakes of white...flurries. It appears the
season of ice may be early.

{GREEN}Before the FernHouse{green}~

    The pathway continues northward for many hours and its
once beauty has become nothing more than a monotonous 
bore. The ferns are less trampled here from sparse foot
traffic and the giant trees seem almost an ugly scar. 
Their trunks have darkened and seem to writhe as they
twist at unimaginable angles. Knotholes cover their bark
and appear like eyes of a haunted soul. Leaves are thick
with rot and the smell forces you to gag continuously...
this is an ominous warning. Such signs are blatant and you
are unsure whether to continue, but shortly ahead you see
an abandoned tower. It is squat and crumbling yet you
continue onward, answers could be found.

{GREEN}Garrison Fern Tower{green}~

    Walking up to the tower forces a gasp of surprise. 
What you believed to be bricks and mortar are nothing 
more than thick tower fronds growing from a huge fern
giving the illusion of a tower. But you were right in 
one aspect for the tower is crumbling. Rotted chunks of
its green leaves are piled at its base, mute evidence 
that this place will likely fall to the elements in a 
short time. Pushing aside a couple fronds you squeeze 
into the interior and mumble ungraciously. Empty but for
a few wooden spears leaning against a far "wall" and a 
round chunk of stone on the dirt floor. There are no 
footprints and the spears appear brittle as a dried 
bramble but the stone is warm to your touch. Perhaps 
the stone may mean something.

{RED}{BOLD}Desert of Asa'Serun{red}{bold}~

    Once your eyes readjust you groan and curse the stone which brought you
here. You answered the riddle and that meant you are alive but perhaps only
for so long. In all directions a lifeless landscape greets you of dry brown
sand. Heavy winds blow grit into your eyes while a clear blue sky sears
all with an unforgiving heat which burns sweat off even as it forms. So this
is the past...or so the riddle seemed to hint. You are to bear witness to
events gone by and possibly intercede forcing an alternate future. Grunting
in acceptance you move along.

    Stumbling in this direction may have been a dire mistake. The

only companion. Even the wind has seemed to increase reaching a 
velocity where the sand pieces bite into the face painfully. 
Staring skyward you wince and curse the glowing yellow ball which 
even now cooks your entire body. Wait...what was that? There it is 
again, a high scornful scream from far away. Peering intently you
mutter and ready your shortbow. The vultures will die before you,

{WHITE}{BOLD}The Burning SandWay{white}{bold}~

    The brown sands seem to bleach to a pale white here, yet it is 
much warmer than the others if such can be said. Waves of unbothered
heat blur your vision southward and you shudder. You have found no
water as of yet and it is beginning to gnaw at your thoughts for 
your supply is running low already. But at least the vultures wont
be bothering you any longer, or most of them anyhow. Grinning you
stand up a little straighter and peer southward following the line
of white sand. It has to be a path...isn't it?

    Walking southward at even a slow pace forces you to become painfully
tired yet you trudge onward. The white sand seems to continue south forever
and is untouched by the hard winds. Yes, it must be a road and a magical
one at that. Gulping you lift a hand to wipe your eyes free of sand when
you are thrown backward by a miniature explosion! Multiple pillars of
seething fire have risen before you baring the pathway, any attempt to
circumvent them fails as new pillars burst forth to bar the path. Cursing
you think back on what has happened. Likely this is a magician's attempt
at protection but who knows, regardless you must get past!

    After much thought you easily bypass the flaming pillars and smirk as
you inwardly congratulate yourself. The answer was simple enough although
perhaps a bit crude. Walking for many more hours southward finally brings
you within view of an actual structure! Down the next dune you can see a
shabbily created small house intersecting the white roadway. Along with
this are about four or five figures that seem to be patrolling. A guard
booth or toll stop perhaps but you hold doubts for far beyond the spot is a
large cloud of dust filling the clear sky. Something is goin on and perhaps
you shouldn't get involved.

    Perhaps the heat has addled your brains or maybe stupidity just runs in
the family but you decide to walk right on down to the small house right out
in the open. The four guards don't notice you immediately as their attention
is fixed on the large cloud far to the south with what seems worry. When you
are almost upon them one glances around you and shouts in alarm turning the
other three as well. Many things become clear from just their sight as they
are plainly warriors from the armor and orcs as well, very large and very
nasty orcs in fact. Stopping you glare at them and spit on the ground! Uh oh
you just accidentally initiated an Orc Ritual by way of spitting called the
smashing duel! He who lives wins!

    Your heart is still pounding through your body from the long 
battle with the Orc guards. They were far from novices and likely 
would have silenced all but the hardiest adventurers, good thing
your a hard bunch. Walking a short ways south reveals that the 
white sands of the magical road have faded as the desert slowly 
leads into hard baked dirt. The dust cloud still rises ominously 
to the south and sounds of combat can be faintly heard. It is
still possible to turn back yet a well traveled road swings in
from the east and continues southward.

    Following the well beaten path brings a frown of worry upon your
face. Corpses lie recently dead in the heat buzzing with flies and even
now being ravaged by the territorial animals. Small cacti push up
everywhere to mingle with the large splashes of blood and evidently
useless weapons. It is painfully clear a battle of large portions is
taking place to the south beyond some small hills.

    Your experience demands caution on the approach here and fortunately
you heed the well known voice. Just over the rise of the hills you drop to
your belly and peek over only a short ways from the road. This sight is
almost horrific in its proportions from the sheer brutality. A small city
is in flames down below and armies are clashing in frenzied combat that
appears to of lost all semblance of order. Orc forces seem to be defending
the town even as humans, elves, and dwarves set it aflame. Small bands
spread through the streets fighting personalized combats and the bodies of
thousands lay silent. Even from hear the clash of arms is deafening while
the profuse carnage sickening. The bodies of the towns citizenry seems to
have taken a hard hit as many are even now being cut down by the Human
allied forces. Now...exactly how do you fit into this?

    Mustering all of your reserves of stealth you approach the city
without being noticed by the outlying Orc Scouts until you stand 
shortly before the burning city walls. Earlier you had noticed a
small water hole of sorts within the city's center and the two 
champion pennants of the two armies surging against one another
there. Even as you stand here a small group of Orc spearmen come 
smashing out of the walls beside you as Elven Archers feather them
liberally in the back and Dwarven Infantry chases the remaining
down for slaughter. Grimacing at the crunch you quickly sidestep a
falling timber and make a decision. Proceed into the city or go 
back the way you came.

    Pushing through the shattered remnants of the front gate, and the corpses
littering the ground, you take the first steps into chaos. Even as you enter
a Dwarven warrior attacks you in battle rage yet you duck and slice his
stomach open. Blood flowing from his lips the old fighter drops quickly to
the ground and spasms with the quick death. Looking around you can see
that this part of the city is more intact than the northern where most of
the smoke and dust is climbing into the air from. Streets point off in all
directions and you can see fighting in most. The water square was north and
even here you can see the Army pennants still standing, but perhaps a little
exploration wouldn't be uncalled for.

   The strange calm that has come over you must have put you to

way of doing such. Merely walking a few streets south brings you 
within much more intense battle yet amazingly you dodge most of
the skirmishes getting involved only to kill a few stragglers who 
figured you as easy pickings. One thing is clear now though, the
Orcs are losing. The city here is saturated with dwarves and elves 
and most likely the humans have the northern reaches occupied. For
every Orc warrior you see about four or five of their enemies.

upon the main battle and gasp. The forces are concentrated here and 
it appears that Orcs have a chance of actually pushing the humans
back! You see two regiments of Dwarves slam into the Orc's from an
alternate direction scattering troops and threatening the formation.
Volleys of arrows also pour on them from archers stationed on the 
remaining buildings. Amazingly the Orcs hold their own and you can 
see why. A huge Orc is leading the defense wearing a wicked looking 
helmet and cutting knights in two with a single swipe of his huge
axe! Screaming the whole time his Battle Cry.

    Fighting for every step you stumble into the southern reaches of the
town and grimace at the wreckage, both lives and livelihood. Most of the
buildings here are nothing but skeletal chambers with smoke billowing
from still burning timbers. Bodies are strewn about like unwanted dolls
and an awful stench fills the air. And even through all the anarchy, of
the continued fighting and screams of horror or triumph you can not help
but be oddly fascinated by a serene picture. Both the blacksmith's and a
peddler's shop are burned to ash - yet they somehow kept their
street signs, swaying in the hot breeze like a lost soul. Laughter
bubbles forth both frightful and calming so that dwarves and humans peer
at you suspiciously... battle madness is creeping in.

a surprise could mean death and this ensures no surprises.  Dwarves and
Elves seem to be coming continuously from the south to replace the worn
humans in this campaign, a luxury the Orcs do not have. Stepping through

you are suddenly accosted by a small elven troupe who demand an id..

hear the grunts and slamming of used metal. A few shops are here as

Orcs without a thought. Elves grimly shoot any being with a greenish
cast to its skin. What crimes have these Clansman done to deserve such
fates? That is a question you must answer later because the Elves are

fall from elven arrows and the circle collapses with the Dwarves 
rushing in like madmen. The black framework from a smoking building

closer to the walls as the designs become regulated, forming modern
Orchish tongue. Limited knowledge of the language allows you to place
only two words...king and god.

surround this middle area rising far above out of sight, supporting
the ceiling. Miniature lanterns hang from all four and give off
a calming red glow. The conversation between the orcs is very
heated now and you expect violence at any moment. The guards of
visiting clansman stand here eyeing you with hatred but have not
attacked. Taking a step forward you grunt as one jabs a halberd
into your chest. "Go no farther..."

Mural of War~

    The west wall here has been accented with a large slab of black
marble and hollows in the four corners burn oil for light. Gazing
upon the marble you are awestruck by the skill of the artisan. It
is indeed a history this time, there is no doubt. From the beginning
you see the Orcs living on the plains, hunting and gathering, and
eventually fighting against the elves and dwarves. Then they confront
humans and although they fight them as well they gain knowledge of
farming and storage, how to preserve food. This seems to go one for
countless years until the humans, elves, and dwarves combine and
attack the Orcs, driving them into the mountains. Enthralled you
looked upon the rest of the marble but find it cracked and destroyed.

Mural of Thress~

    Like the opposing west wall this one is accented with a material
but here it is a dirty, impure form of coal. Only a single candle sits
on the floor to light the area here. In the center of the coal is a
man shrouded in shadows, holding forth a large sword and motioning
for creatures to attack some tower. Orcs are among the monsters but
you sense they are working against their will, being forced to do
this deed. Besides this the land the tower inhabits is vaguely drawn
within the coal yet chills overcome you as your mind faintly considers
its existence. Spitting you cannot help but think of the foulness
associated with the man and what he had done. Plainly inscribed at
the mural's bottom is the Orcish word for HATE.

Throne of Akshinrru~

    Reaching the throne you are dismayed by its plainness, a simple
wooden structure with skulls lining the armrest and dragon's fangs
over hanging the top. The Chieftan sits there with rage smouldering
behind dark, glassy eyes. Not at you, but at this visitor who even
now is screaming accusations and demanding something from the great
lord. Akshinrru finally stands and backhands the man, knocking him
behind dark, glassy eyes. Not at you, but at this visitor who even

Honor Guard~

    A fully armored warrior stands here silently, only a faint
whisper of air coming from the helmet and a slightly moving
chest to detect life. The armor is of wood, dried and stained
with blood while yellow markings give it a tribal look. There
is no doubt that this is the ceremonial garb of the Chieftans
honor guard. A brazier sets beside him giving off some light
and warmth while a faded tapestry covers the dirt wall behind
him. Reaching for the tapestry you are halted as a deep growl
comes from the warrior.

    No light brightens this area yet an eerie glow from a cloaked
Orc gives you a sense of...ease? It is alarming to feel such when
you expected evil, dread, and fear. You can see no features, even
the creatures hands are gloved and a hood enshrouds the face in
entirety. Dust covers the floor and walls which are frozen stiff,
small markings carved into their icy depths. The cloaked one begins
mumbling incoherently its voice rising steadily into a mind numbing
screech...then it throws forth its arm. He points at you...

where magic wont work. Praying you manage to move a few inches

{CYAN}{BOLD}Infinity Chasm{cyan}{bold}~

    Busting out of the small tunnel it crumbles slightly and the
moans of the underworld subside. Standing on the edge of a black
pit you fumble with your torch and it falls. Listening closely
you detect no sound of impact and worry worms its way into your
soul. The mountain may be settling but you are becoming just the
opposite. Hugging the wall you try to circumvent the chasm, for 
it goes beyond a mere pit. You nearly lose footing when a green
flame takes substance in mid air. The flame is simply hovering
in the air. Suddenly a duller violet fire erupts beside it and 
where they meet a sickly yellow flame is created.

and you can feel equipment on your skin. Indeed, flexing your

grasses grow around you and the chirping of birds faintly rise and
fall. The soil on which you step is very dark and fertile while the
pollen of flowers intermingle with the fresh breezes. Now you can
place the smell, it is one of cleanliness. The place must be from
a different time, a different existence, or merely a possibility of
existence.

filled with a malicious foreboding. The grasses are shorter here, with
a trampled look from recent use and the Tolistra Roses are not as
profuse, thier beautiful scent fading along with your peace. Kneeling
and running fingers along browned grasses a slight frown marrs your

blackened sword you scream obscenities. To the west stands four
towering, bird-like creatures. One opens its beak and screeches
the sound you heard before...elven Gryphons.

single elf stands with them, patting one to soothe its jittery
mind. They seem to be blockading you from an entourage of people
even farther west, clustered secretively around one of the strange
sickening trees. The grass here is all brown, stunted horribly in
its growth and trampled greatly as if by an army. Dark patches
speckle its path both south and north, possibly remains of a hard
battle.

a view of the tree. The mangled plant is long dead but suprise
comes not from this, but the being which sways from one of its
branches. Akshinrru the Orc Lord, Chieftan of the Poison Clan
is there, hanging from a short rope. His body bleeds in countless
places, lacerations and bruises clearly visible from his tattered
clothing. Walking closer you notice that one of his legs is
broken and an eye socket looks ruptured. The Orc is dead now but
he must have endured much before succumbing to its bliss. The

the sun and the odd trees scattered far onto the plains for some

Tolistra Roses. Fortunately this faint southern path is less
populated with them. Scouting around you notice the grass is
marred by decaying spots, rotting as it lives. Whatever disease
has taken foot it must be contained, spreading only to the south.
The pathway is only a faint part between the grasses but at one
time it must have been huge. Tips of bricks and cobbles peek
through the damp soil occasionaly, evidence of a grand highway
built by only the richest of kingdoms.

    Your blade connects with the remains of a stone fence and
the jarring impact forces you to groan. It definately doesn't
help the headache. The grasses effectively hid the weathered
structure from view, thorny grasses growing around and even
through its pitted surface. You could light these grasses on
fire but you doubt that control would be maintained easily.
Shrugging you kick the fence once and listen as it creaks and
topples inward. Once again you begin swiping at the grasses
but they quickly reduce to short, brown grass beyond the
fences perimeter.

strong spiderwebs. Rhodents skitter at your entrance and a bell
chimes within the temple. This place is merely a one room place
of worship. A moth eaten carpet dominates the floor while faded
pictures hand on all the walls. They are too decayed to represent
anything you'd understand, but at the room's center is a bier.
Frowning your walk forward and tense up immediatly...magic,

across the metal so that a forced escape would be...unlikely. Some

lost and forgotten to the living. For all that work you have
stumbled into nothing more than a second dungeon, an unused one
at that. Kicking at some of the dust you notice a shiny object
flattened against the floor and bend down for a closer look.
Suddenly the object flares into bright light and a tentacle
lashes out...

{BLUE}The Ancient Tunnel{blue}~

    The door was amazingly simple to open once unlocked. As soon
as you heard the device click the tingle of magic faded and it
glided open of its own will. Stepping northward brings you into
a squat hallway lined with lifeless stone. Nothing is here but
traces of dust and petrified rhodents. This place was sealed
long ago, for safety, for ceremony....or even fear, you cannot
tell. Along the left wall you notice minute marks, black as coal
they are rubbed away to tiny smudges but some uniformity is
maintained. Its common tongue...you can only make out one word
and it boggles you, "Faith"

{BLUE}Dusty Tunnel{blue}~

    Time is wasting and these depths dont foster pleasurable
feelings so you have trudged further inward. The tunnel seems an
endless journey, almost a tortuous one because of how it forces
you to stoop from its squatness. Now the dust is becoming less
settled and you notice animal markings ranging from feces to
accumulated trash as bedding. Darkness is becoming an old friend
so you light a fresh torch and listen for signs of life. Faintly
a breeze touches your cheek...

{BLUE}Tunnel of Echoes{blue}~

    Chittering is echoing along the tunnel now, an insect sound
that sets your teeth on edge. There is also a backtone similar to
that of summer crickets, eerie and all the more disturbing in the
unfamiliar depths. The ceiling is raising slightly while water
begins to seep between cracks in the wall. Pale, fluorescent
moss is also taking advantage of the fluid for growth. Chunks of
the ceiling have collapsed but none are large enough to barr your
passage.

{BLUE}Ancient Ladder{blue}~

    Hours later you reach a rusted ladder which descends and
ascends. Water drips along one of its sides continuously and a
loud dripping noise is heard below. This entire place is clearly
unstable, or aged to such a degree that it could collapse at
any time. Two unreadable plaques are cemented into the walls,
one with an arrow point up and the other down. You cannot

{BLUE}Standing Pool{blue}~

    The rungs of the ladder bent severely as you descended ever
so slowly. With one or two more uses theyll be completely useless.
About a foot of water is here being fed by cracks in the walls
and the water sliding down the ladder. The white moss covers the
walls in entirety and some even floats within the water. Grabbing
a piece you lick it and grimace at the bitterness, but you feel
it is likely edible if you should need food. Walking towards the
south end of the chamber you feel a current pick up and water
splashing loudly. It must be draining quickly somewhere...

    Walking into the room you see the walls expand greatly where
the water has cut them away and long mineral stalactites hanging
from the ceiling. The splash has risen to a full roar while the
current doubles pulling your feet from under you. Coughing and
choking from the unexpected fall you are dragged ever closer to
the center of the whirlpool which drops into unknown depths. With
a much needed adrenaline boost your body manages to stand and
leap into the air. Thanking the gods for the magic of flight you
quickly leave the area.

{BLUE}Ladder Tunnel{blue}~

    Sweating with the effort of climbing the ladder you glance
downward and are surprised at how far you've come. The glow of the
moss can barely be detected now and a fall would prove most
disastrous. Besides this you are worried about the state of the
ladder, its rungs continue to bend dangerously with each new one
you grab. Where it is cemented to the wall it is also breaking
apart, the stone crumbling from exposure to water while the
metal corrodes from weathering agents.

{BLUE}Weathered Tunnel{blue}~

    The ladder has collapsed and you are now scaling the side
of the upward tunnel, seeking handholds in the stone where it
has pitted from wear and tear. Twice you slipped and were forced
to slam your back into the opposite wall, slicing deeply into
your arms and lower back. Muttering and cursing you place one
hand above the other and literally pull yourself up every inch
of the way. Hour after hour you continue to do this, taking
infrequent breaks for a gulp of water, when the top comes within
sight, torchlight marking its existance.

{CYAN}Carpeted Hallway{cyan}~

    Dust and grime layer your armor while sweat stings very tired
eyes. Upon reaching the edge of the tunnel you heave yourself over
the edge and collapse in a wheezing heap. Nodding off for a short
while you wake to find you are now in a east to west tunnel with
the east blocked off by a huge pile of debris, likely from the
ceiling collapsing.  An old red carpet follows the course of the
hallway and torches can be seen in the distance at intervals. This
place appears somewhat newer but still abandoned by the civilized.
Reaching for a torch you pull away in surprise....an illusion?

{CYAN}Hall of Illusions{cyan}~

    Walking westward you brace against the wall as the entire
structure shudders from some sort of impact. The sound that
accompanies the shaking seems similar to thunder but more on
a higher level, its intensity almost frightening. Upon touching
the illusions of this place they slowly fade, as have the torches,
tables, and even the carpet so far. All that is left is dark stone
and even darker smells. Grasping your weapon tightly you proceed.

{CYAN}Grand Staircase{cyan}~

    The hallway ends at a grand staircase which circles upward in
a majestic flourishing manner. All types of carvings adorn its
steps and rails, ranging from the frivolous to fearful. Large
braziers are stationed about the chamber with red coals lending
the room a hellish quality. Stepping towards the staircase you
notice your feet sticking and jump back. Blood, fresh and ripe
covers most of the floor. Indeed, fresh corpses lie behind the
braziers so that you did not notice them before. As your mind
tumbles over the discovery a low moan can be heard...

{CYAN}Top of the Staircase{cyan}~

    Climbing the stairway you are finally greeted with windows
which allow you to view the outside. All you can see is a cloudy
sky dark with nighttime that flashes constantly from lightning.
Slowing the pace you nearly lose your footing as one bolt lights
close to the tower. Almost blind from the brightness the impact
and accompanying thunder shakes the tower violently, small chips
of mortar raining down from above. Trusting in luck you leap
for the head the stairs, cracking your knee as relative safety
is attained. Mumbling and standing your vision is now greeted
by four exits, all stairwells continuing the upward spiral.

    Unlike the grand stairwell this one is crushingly tiny
and treacherous due to rain blowing in from tiny portholes
dotting the wall. Allowing a better look at the grounds
outside you vaguely see some sort of forest, dark and devoid
of leaves. Another flash of lightning flashes and then heavy
rain sweeps in, blocking all other sights. A tattered carpet
follows the steps and torches stand across from each of the
windows. Suddenly a hard wind explodes from behind, climbing
the stairwell and impacting you...

{CYAN}Hidden Chamber{cyan}~

    As the wind slammed into you from above you were forced
from your feet and carried into a well hidden side chamber.
Once there the stones crumbled from beneath your feet and you
slid into this strange chamber. It appears as nothing more
than a box, all four walls covered in blood red tapestries
tooled in gold and silver thread. The thread is old, no longer
forming the image it once did but you are able to make out
some sort of manlike being draped in a cloak. A symbol for
something you cannot understand likely. Peering upwards you
can see the hole through which you fell. Walking towards the
center of the room you notice a small trapdoor and lift it
up. Below you can see the beginning of the grand staircase
yet again. With a little rope you could slip through and
drop down.

{CYAN}Chamber of the Disciples{cyan}~

    The wind literally picked you up and lifted you through a
hole in the ceiling. As it unceremoniously dropped you onto the
stone floor a torch flickered into life within the room. Dark
cloaked figures encircle you now, with only deep green eyes
flashing occasionally from beneath the confines of black hoods.
The room is huge, its ceiling rising several hundred feet into
the air where another hole is seen. A blinding aura is detected
from that area but you are drawn to the silver sparkling of the
ethereal stairs leading there. The figures begin a harmonious
chant and you leap to your feet. They have not attacked...yet.

    The stairs are extremely dangerous and the distance beyond
comprehension. What seemed like a hundred feet must stretch into
miles for you have spent two torches upon the climb so far. Below
you can still detect the cloaks of the dispatched beasts, barely.
They appear as nothing more than ants. Understanding begins to
dawn on you and with it comes fear. This place is going beyond
the accepted rules of existence. What people could once hold on
to as unbreakable fact is gone...things here are being manipulated
somehow, somewhere. A stray wind lightly touches your back and you
flail your arms rapidly to maintain balance. Now is not the time
for contemplative thought, not with only a few feet between life
and death.

{CYAN}Aura of Oblivion{cyan}~

    Noise disappears completely and all natural light fades away.
This place is different from the rest, malicious you would say.
Stepping over the threshold you are uncertain of the intelligence
of this decision. The entrance hole morphs into solid stone and a
crystal flares into brilliant blue light at the chambers center.
A frail looking man stands there with a smirk on his face. Mostly
bald with grey temples and red fiery eyes, he stands no taller than
four feet. A virgin white robe adorns his body while a gnarled stick
is clutched fiercely in his left fist, as if without it he would fall.
Glancing quickly around you the chamber is nondescript, slick black
marble with no fluff, just a ceiling which rounds off into an
egg-like shape. And beyond this there are no visible exits...

    Rubbing sore eyes you look up into blackness and freeze solid.
Total blackness, but you are not alone. Something is wheezing as if
its breath were laboured. Unsheething a sword you send it in long
sweeping arcs around the area. Something creaks with movement and
you backpedal, slamming a shoulder into whatever is there? An
inkling of light prods through where you hit as rotted bits of a
fern drop to the ground. Throwing your head around just in time
for a blind-side swipe you go flying across the darkness and slam
into more rotted fronds.

{CYAN}The Metallic Fern{cyan}~

     As your vision becomes clearer you notice that the air is full
of a metallic tang. Indeed it is full of a dust which tastes almost
exactly like rust. You know because of your apprenticeship with the
Midgaard Blacksmith. A tiny light far overhead lets in a smidge of
poor cloudy light, just enough to view the immediate surroundings.
Walking in all directions you are promptly stopped by huge fronds
which are made of...metal? Yes, this entire structure is some sort
of mechanical fern. Backing up some you slam your shoulder into one
of the fronds and feel the entire structure shudder. A faint rumble
begins and the fronds slowly groan into action...

    Hmmph!!! You slam into the ground with a large thud and are
certain a few of your bones just snapped! What in the name of the
immortals is goin on? Brushing dirt from your armor you take a
quick survey of the impromptu destination. It appears that you
are several hundred feet above the fern tower, standing on some
of the thinnest, and rotted, fronds you have ever
you stab at the frond once and regret it almost immediately. The 
one you stabbed breaks loose and plummets to the ground, 
splattering in a most unceremonious manner. Wasting no
time you quickly drop and crawl over a frond to wrap yourself
around the stem and shimmy down, then something giggles...
