{MAGENTA}{BOLD}Standing in front of a large plastic dog house{magenta}{bold}~

{BLUE,BOLD}  After making it through the puzzles,
{BLUE,BOLD}  you walk up to a large doghouse. Inside
{BLUE,BOLD}  there looks to be a 5 foot {RED,BOLD}red {BLUE,BOLD}dog.
{BLUE,BOLD}  He is staring straight at you, seems
{BLUE,BOLD}  sort of eery. Maybe you should just
{BLUE,BOLD}  leave him alone.  As you try to leave,
{BLUE,BOLD}  the 5 foot red dog blocks your way.{blue,bold}
