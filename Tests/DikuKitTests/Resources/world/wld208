Cell~
     This is no place one would want to live.  The walls are covered with
filth, floors are a discrase.  The toilet and sink is not to be desired,
and that bed is not very inviting.  But what do you expect, you are in

 The stairway has continued downward to what seems to be a platform.
The platform is old and rotted, and made of 100 year old wood.  In a
way it looks as if it might be a door, because it is hollow underneath.
Surely this old piece of wood isn't any security measure to hold someone
in.  By any means it is old and will not support the way of you and your
party much longer.  There is an exit to the east yet it is pitch black.
Sure beats falling through this wood.  Better decide fast.
