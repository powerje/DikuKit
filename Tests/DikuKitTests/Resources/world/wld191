{BOLD}{CYAN}A Dusty Road{cyan}{bold}~
     You find yourself on a lonely road leading toward what
seems to be a castle in the distance.  You have heard legends
about a castle up in the mountains, but never quite
believed them.  A name has even been mentioned about this
mysterious castle....but you can't quite remember it at this
moment.  You decide to go and see if this is the castle
all of the rumors are about.

{WHITE,BOLD}The Drawbridge{white,bold}~

    You walk farther up the path and see a bridge spanning an
immense chasm.  It looks old and rickety, but seems to be
your only way to the castle ahead.  As you walk out onto
the bridge the rotten boards beneath you feet suddenly give
way and you begin to fall!  WHEEW! THANK GOD that you can
FLY!  In the distance, the castle looms above you.

This is going to take a while to climb.  Jeesh.

    When you enter to this well lit room, you notice that it is
sparsly furnished and is fairly large.  Standing in the middle of the
room is the biggest man you've ever seen.  He has every type of weapon
imaginable strapped to him on various places, and he looks like he can
use every one.  He looks at you and says, "Good, another has made it
through the maze.  To finish your training and become a true warrior
you must know pass your final test.  Defeat me or die."  With that
he pulls out a sword and dagger and assumes a fighting stance.  Maybe
the maze wasnt so bad after all.

    You see a fairly nondescript room except for the three glowing
portals situated around the room.  There seems to some kind of...
force...swirling around the three portals, blocking your way from going
into any of them.  Seems you need to rid yourself of it before you
can continue.  Then you have a choice.  Which to take?

{BOLD}{BLACK}Chamber{black}{bold} {BOLD}of{bold} {BOLD}{YELLOW}Mirrors{yellow}{bold}!~
     As you wander farther and farther into this strange castle, you come
to a chamber that is devoid of any trappings common to the rest of the
castle.  As you glance around this cold and barren room, you notice a tall
mirror that you had not seen before in one of the far corners.  When you walk
over to the mirror and look within its crystalline depths, you begin to see
image after image of the city of {GREEN}Midgaard{green} and the rest of this world pass
quickly before your eyes.  Understanding, Awe, and no small amount of Fear
come to you all at once.  This is where {RED}Airagar{red}, {BLUE}Lord of {CYAN}Wind{cyan}, surveys and
watches this world.
You are within the legendary {BLACK}Chamber{black} of {YELLOW}Mirrors{yellow}!
