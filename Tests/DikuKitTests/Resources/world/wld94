{BL}The dark woods{bl}~

{CY}You are travelling through woods
that are as dark as night. The trees 
above block all light and wind.
The air is stagnant and smells of 
death and decay. The lack of sounds
and other signs of life make your skin
crawl  and you feel very much like
turning back and heading for safer 
areas. The path leads north into more 
open lands while it also leads south
into the darkness of the forest.{c}

{BL}The dark woods{bl}~

{CY}You wearily travel through the darkness
of the forest. Huge skeletal trees line the 
edges of the path and tower above you.
Errant rays of light spear down through
the gaps in the canopy above and provide 
small spots of light that seem to attract
what little foliage can grow on the dark 
forest floor. The path winds north and 
south into the darkness.{c}

The small intersection in the forest~


 {CY}The forest path splits here 
in three directions. Small
paths lead to the east, north,
and south. The trees above
leave a gap which allows
light to fill the intersection.
It is almost as though you are
in a circle of light that provides
sanctuary in this dark land.{c}

 {CY}You stand at the edge of a 
dark forest. A path leads
north into the forest and 
its deadly darkness and
silence. Looking west, you
see a path that leads up
into a region of foothills.
Standing here on the
boundary between light
and darkness, you feel
very vulnerable and alone.{c}

In the dense forest~

dark forest. No sounds
can be heard and little
light penetrates the canopy
of trees above you. The air
here smells musty and
you long for a fresh breath.
You see an intersection
of paths to the west. The
path you are on leads south 
into the darkening woods.{c}

 {CY}This is a small intersection.
Paths lead east, west, and 
south. You are struck by the
carnage here when you 
enter the clearing. There
appears to have been a
great battle here. Blood
is everywhere and the 
ground is all torn up.
Pieces of beaten armour 
and broken blades lie all
around. Examining the
tracks here lead you to
believe that the dead and
wounded were drug off in
two directions, south and east.{c}

Sheltered by this wall of stones,
a small cluster of plants have
sprung up. In the center of this
group of trees and bushes, is a
huge gnarled tree. It appears to
have been twisted and torn by
the forces of nature. It sways
and moans as a strong wind
from the south tears through
its old feeble branches. The

as a home. Skeletal remains lie
all over. Several half-eaten corpses
are rotting away slowly in the
gloomy darkness. In the back

Among the crude huts~

{CY}You walk through the crude village. 
Small huts made of wood and thatch
surround you. Every so often, you can
hear grunts and snarls inside the huts.
The smell here is unbearable. You 
wonder what type of creature could 
possibly live in such squallor. Small 
paths lead west and north here.{c}

The gathering place~

{CY}This appears to be the clearing the
ogres use to assemble. It is quite large
and has a raised mound in the center
that contains a crude throne. The ground
in front of the throne is quite worn, as
if it is sat on quite often. You get the
impression that this place is a crude
sort of auditorium. Small paths lead
east and south.{c}

adventurers. A large lodge is towards
the north, while paths lead east, west,
