{G}A narrow forest trail{g}~
{G}
  This narrow forest trail leads slightly down-
  hill into a wide ravine.  A thick canopy shades
  the entire forest floor, keeping the air moist
  and the temperature down.  The path continues
  south further down the ravine.

  levels out with the rest of the forest here,

  deeper into the forest, with many ancient

  leading south appears to be more frequently

  The pure water of the Anaya river flows into
  the great Greenwater Lake.  Along the shore
  of the lake, trees, flowers, and shrubs all
  grow tall and in abundance.  Varried kinds

  here to drink from this pure lake.  Grasses
  grow tall in the water around the shore,
