{C}Along a sandy beach{c}~
   {BLUE}You emerge from the mox on this deserted stretch of beach.  The sand 
   shimmers in the heat making it hard to gauge distances.  The sparkling blue
   ocean is some distance north while the beach seems to stretch out endlessly  
   to the east.{blue}

   {BLUE}As you wander out onto the beach the hot sand under foot and the glaring

   the north while you begin to make out what looks to be a large rock formation

   {BLUE}As you finally approach the outcropping, you notice that this is not
   natural. These stones, ranging everywhere from pebbles to boulders, have been
   laid here as a definite barrier to keep anyone from going any further east.
   The wall seems to run all the way north to the ocean.  Best to forget about

{C}Wall Of Air{c}~
   {BLUE}As you fearlessly explore the surrounding beach, you unexpectedly run
   into an invisible wall running north-south all the way down to the water. No
   matter how you squint or turn your head you can't see it, but there is
   definitely something blocking your way west.  Someone or something seems to
   be channeling you straight into the ocean.{blue}

  You are most fortunate indeed to have found this.{blue}

{W}Serra's Sanctum{w}~
  {W}The scene before you is one of unbelievable beauty. Pue golden light streams
  in from the high vaulted windows along the walls. A lush rich carpet stretches
  forth towards a throne made of ivory. Elegantly detailed tapestries depicting
  by gone ages and more present looking situations also spot the walls.{w}

{W}A Magical Path{w}~
  {W}As you step onto this small path of rocks you feel an incredible lightness.
  Due to the enormous size of Serra's realm, she has enchanted this path and 
  certain others to transport you great distances with but a single step. It might
  be wise to take caution however since you'll have no idea where you'll end up.{w}
