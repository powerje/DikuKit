{BOLD}{GREEN}A Strange Clearing in the Forest{bold}{green}~
{CYAN}
   A small lizard perched on a brown stone.  Feeling threatened by
   the approach of human beings along the path, it metamorphosed
   into a stingray beetle, then into a stench-puffer, then into a fiery
   salamander.
 
   You smile.  These conversions aren't real.  It had assumed the
   forms of obnoxious little monsters, but not their essence.  It could
   not sting, stink, or burn.  It was a chameleon, using its magic to
   mimic creatures of genuine threat.
 
   Yet as it shifts into the form of a basilisk it glares at you with such
   ferocity that your mirth abates.  If its malice could strike, you
   would be horribly dead.

   You have entered a small village at the center of a magical

   wonder to yourself what could be so special about this place that it
   needs to protected by a magical shield.  Roads lead away from this
   spot in all directions and you can see a multitude of shops lining

   in the middle of the road, levitating about 20 foot in the air.  What
   a strange place !  The road exits north to the Drunken Pikeman, and south
   to the Great Bank of Xanth.  The road continues east and a crossroads is

   the sky as if they were feeding.  Nearby a young child
   is spending his time sighing and making spots appear on
   a rock.  To the north, the Red Boar Inn is looking rather
   inviting.  To the south, the herbalist is grumpily mixing
   a concoction of something or other.  The road continues

   The armoury is spick and span, surprising for a weapons shop.  It doesn't
   seem as though much work is being done here at the moment, as the armourer
   is resting up against a far table. In a corner there is a pile of bronze
   weaponry that an adventurer could probably find useful.  Looking at your
   own self you wonder if you could use a change in weaponry.  There is an
   exit south, on to the Western road.

   in the night to perform their arts in the cover of pure dark so as

   This area is completely empty, it is only a dirt lot waiting for
   someone to build something on to it.  It looks like a great place
   to jump into the real estate business!  You notice several others
   checking out the property also.

{GREE,BO}Ryoko Road{gree}~
   {MAGEN,BO}
   Ryoko once visited the lands of {GREE}Xanth{MAG} long enough to teach the
   humans here to respect beautiful demons who like to wear skimpy clothing
   or even none at all when she can.  A large statue of Ryoko attempting to
   persuade Tenchi into joining the adult conspiracy is set in the middle of
   the road.

   The sky above is dark, darker than it normally is at night.  Heh, is it
   even nighttime?  No matter, there appears to be some open housing to the
   south.

     The hidden monster beneath Xanth makes a home
     here, he spies to people above from his dastardly
     alcove, shrouded in secrecy and the shadows of the
     night. Those above have no knowledge of his presence
     other than the strange shadow that children report
     seeing lurking in the night.
