  As a child, Theodore Seuss Geisel drew pictures of 
  creatures. He gave his creatures unusual names. His 
  mother encouraged him. She permitted him to draw on
  the attic walls and scraps of wallpaper. Though his 
  pictures were not popular with his art teacher, his 
  friends loved them. It was Ted's undying will that 
  enabled him to write and illustrate the books so many 
  have grown to love. His passing on Tuesday, September 
  24, 1991 in La Jolla, California at the age of eighty-
  seven, marked the end of his struggle with throat cancer.
  Dr. Theodore Seuss Geisel will never be forgotten.

  Theodore Seuss Geisel has been known by many names. He began
  using Ted Seuss or just Seuss while attending Dartmouth College.
  He was the senior editor for the Jack O'Lantern and had been
  told to resign from this position as a punishment for throwing a 
  party in his apartment. To get around this punishment, he began
  using Seuss. In 1956, he added the title Doctor to his name upon
  receiving an honorary doctorate degree from Dartmouth. Dr. Seuss
  also wrote under the name of Theo LeSieg (Geisel backwards).
  He only used this name on books that he did not illustrate himself.
  Whether, Ted, Theo, Geisel, LeSieg, Seuss or Dr. Seuss, this man's
  style was his true signature.

  everyone stops. King Derwin's entourage comes down
  the street. All citizens stop and remove their hats.

  A long purple carpet is rolled out from the door to

  find a coat closet, a hall leading to a bathroom and 
  bedrooms, and the living room. It seems as though the 
  children had some destructive visitors. What a mess! 
  This is going to take forever to clean up. You only

 "Wow! Mom is going to flip," you think to yourself as 
  you head down the hall. The pictures are falling 
  off the wall. The glass that once protected them 
  now crunches under your feet. You reach to straighten
  the picture of Sally. As you pull the sock from 
  its corner, it bites you - OUCH!!

                   THE WINDOW
    Standing  in front     of a giant  picture 
    window,  you  hear     noises   up   ahead.
    The bathroom  door     is slightly cracked. 
    You  can  see  the     soft glow  of light  
 
    from  within.  You     wonder if you should 
    stand   here   and     fight   off  what is 
    left   of    these     family  portraits or 
    take your  chances     entering the bathroom.

  Pink and lacy, this is Sally's room. Pictures of 
  puppies in white washed frames adorn her walls. 
  There is a small white braided rug in the middle 
  of the room with a handcrafted, white, wooden 
  doll house on it. A shelf of valuable porcelain 
  dolls now shattered, clings to the wall on one 
  hook. The canopy bed sits in the far corner of the 
  room. At least, it used to sit there...

  The stench of dirty socks and half eaten

  find dirty underwear, socks, t-shirts, muddy

  A superman action figure appears to be missing

  With strict instructions to stay out of

  fighting an illness, and you smile. Your  
  smile quickly fades as you note the articles

  this placed cleaned up before she gets home.  
  Do you remember how to restuff and sew pillows?

  East of center city is the entrance to town hall.
  The outside of the magnificent building is decorated 
  with thousands of little white lights.  The mayor's

  The aroma of the Who-feast pours out into the street

  The Brown Bar-ba-loots, the Swomee-Swans, and the

  The Once-ler begins his story of the Truffula Tree and
  their sweet scent and great beauty. The Truffula Trees 
  were brightly coloured and smelled so sweet.  They even
  bore Truffula Fruit.  The Once-ler was so impressed with
  these trees that he chopped one down and created a Thneed.
  The thneed was very useful and soon all around wanted a 
  thneed for his very own. So, the Once-ler built a great 
  factory and production began.
