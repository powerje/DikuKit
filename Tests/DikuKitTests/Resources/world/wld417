The Wheel of Time~
  
  {W,BO}The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass,
  leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades
  to myth and even myth is long forgotten when the Age 
  that gave it birth comes again. You see the threads
  of everything that lives being spun out into the world,
  yet there are a few threads that are causing every other
  thread to bend to them.{w,bo}

Approaching Tear~
  
  {W,BO}As you are spun into the world you notice that you
  are in a field. All around you there are trees and flowers.
  If you look north you see a vast city that could only be Tear. 
  Banners and flags fly from poles. One of the banners is the
  banner of Tear, and one is the banner of the great Dragon Reborn.{w,bo}

The Main Gates of Tear~
 
  {W,BO}As you approach the gates you see traffic going through
  quite steadily. Guards are posted at the gate to stop anyone
  that looks suspicious. Past the gate you can see a huge palace. 
  For many centuries the Stone of Tear held a weapon of prophetic
  powers. Recently, the weapon was removed as fulfillment of one 
  of the many prophecies of the Dragon.{w,bo}

Grand Hall~
  
  {W,BO}The Grand Hall of the palace is almost breathtaking. A huge 
  red carpet with gold trim runs up the middle of it, and paintings 
  line the wall. Guards are positioned throughout the hall to protect 
  the king from anyone that would seek to cause harm.{w,bo}
