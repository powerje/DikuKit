   {C}In the distance you can see an ancient
   castle, dark clouds looming atop it.
   The sound of a thousand soldiers emanates
   from the inner depths of the keep.
   Approaching closer, you can see just
   how large and dominant this castle looks.

   {BO}The size is astounding while the
   continuous chattering seems to
   last forever. Perhaps you should
   take a look around, and perhaps
   you'll find something of use.{bo}

   frightening) castle. A carefully
   constructed drawbridge slowly
   lowers for you to enter inside
   the castle. Better make sure
   your skills are advanced enough
   beyond this point -- otherwise
   they may just not let you enter.{bo}
