{W}Bozo's Training Room{w}~
After climbing the fountain you have discovered Bozo's training room, he alone has the power to increase your levels... A sign standing here says the following...

"To train for your next level, you type the following: 
TRAIN LEVEL W (if you are a Warrior) or TRAIN LEVEL M (if you are a Mage), etc...
The word LEVEL will tell Bozo that you want to LEVEL, it does not mean that you can type in a number to be that level. {Wrong way = TRAIN 29 W} {Right Way = TRAIN LEVEL W}

To improve your STATS, you do the following:
TRAIN STR (for Strength) or TRAIN WIS (for Wisdom), etc...
It costs 4 practice points to increase your main attribute which is determined by your race, and 6 practice points for any others.

Please approach Bozo when you feel you are ready."

{W}Western End of Altar{w}~

  You are standing west of the Temple Altar in the northern end of the Temple
of Midgaard. Twenty feet above you stand stained-glass windows depicting
the glorious wars and benevolent acts perfomed by The COMMITTEE over the
years, casting long, bright, rectangles onto the otherwise hard, stone floor.

  You feel a warm wind brush over your shoulder and you turn around casually.
You are surprised to see something that you didn't notice before. The wall
in front of you bears the following words chiselled across its dark stone
face in faintly glowing mystic characters:

----  Ask not what NC can do for You, But what You can do for NC  ----
