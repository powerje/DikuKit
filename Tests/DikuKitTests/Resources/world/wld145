{BLU}Along a paved walkway{blu}~
You are walking on a long paved walkway leading to a huge house
at the end of it. Large trees line each side of the shrubbery 
blocking out the sunlight and causing visibility to be poor. Some
fallen leaves are scattered about.

{R}Before the mansion{r}~

You have reached the end of the paved walkway and are now 
standing outside of a large mansion. As you come out from the
trees bordering the walkway the sunlight momentarily blinds you
and your eyes adjust. There is a small shed to the east which
appears to be bolted shut.

{R}The shed{r}~

  You step into the small shed and glance around. There is 
practically every tool you could ever need in stock here. In the
corner of the room there is a green ring drawn onto the wall. It
appears to be shimmering with a faint glow. It might be best to
stay away from it.

{R}Greeting room{r}~

As you walk through the front door of the mansion you begin to
get an understanding of how large this house really is. The room
you come into is a large greeting room. You glance around and
can not help but be tempting to try to swipe one of the antique
objects which decorate the room. There is a guide standing before
you waiting for the next tour to begin.

You get a {BO,RED}BAD{r} feeling looking in that direction!!~
You are moving through the large greeting room looking for an exit
or perhaps a way to one of the upper levels of the mansion. You
can't help but consider trying to snatch a few items you see as 
you pass them. No ones looking...I bet you could get a fair amount
of coins in Midgaard for that gold clock. As tempting as it is you 
decide you better not for fear of getting caught. You have heard
stories of what happened to the last thief caught in this place. You
do not want to be the next.

seem to go further into the snowy forest.

You stumble into a cozy little cave off the path. The warmth from

A small table sits in the center of the room with someones dinner
set out ready to be eaten. Movement by the fireplace catches your
attention and you turn and look. A small halfman, halfgoat creature
is resting in a chair sipping on his tea by the fire. He is surprized
by your sudden entrance and places his cup down and scurries to his feet.

{YELLOW,BOLD}SANCTUARY{yellow,bold}~

You take a larger path leading away from the frozen stream in hopes
of finding some sign of shelter. Not paying attention where you are
walking leads you suddenly into a wall. How did this get in the middle
of the path. As you glance upwards to see if you could climb over 
a chill goes down your spine..its not a wall at all...it's a Giant!

{W}Outside a little dam{w}~

Going northward of the little trail along the frozen stream you
come to a sharp turn and see the stream runs into a larger 
frozen river. On the edge of the frozen river rests a small dam
built by the local beavers. Smoke hurls out of a little chimney on 
top of the dam. The air is filled with the smell a homecooked meal,
and you decide to knock and grovel for scraps.

As you duck under the door entrance and step inside you are amazed 
by how much can fit inside the small home. Two little beds lay against
the far wall, and a wooden table is the center piece of the furniture.
A female beaver sits at her sewing machine making a new cloth for the 
table. You are greeted by a cheerful male beaver who says "gimme paw"
and emits a howling noise.

{R}Trail leading to a castle{r}~

Gasping for air you emerge out from under the blanket of ice which 
covers the frozen river. It seems you have drifted quite a bit down 
steam while beneath the ice. Now you shiver from the chill of the wind
and wish you were back at Mr. Tumnus' in front of the fireplace.
There is a small castle a short walk to the north. Its shadowy towers
give you an unsettling feeling. With no other shelter, it is your 
only option.

Castle Entrance~

 As you enter the castle, silence is your comfort, for the cold
speeding winds can not reach you here. The chamber you are in is
damp and dark. Some light shines through the doorways on each side,
but only enough to let you notice that there is doorways. Shadows
blanket the floor and you feel as if they are approaching you. To
the north lies a stairwell leading upwards to the upper level of
the mansion. The stone figures on your left let you know to be on
guard...the White Witch is known to surprise her victims.

covered with a heavy red carpet which is comforting on your

making it possible to see a little down the hallway in each direction.
To the west the hallways end seems far, but to the east the end

large funny red hat walks across the hallway and disappears out

{Y}Far corner of the ballroom{y}~
You finally have worked your way through the crowd of dancers
and are standing at the far corner of the ballroom. There is an
exit to the east but the door is closed. You turn the knob but
no luck....it is locked :-(. You begin to check your pockets for 
a key to the door. Did you find one? If not you are most likely 
dead.

{R}Bend in the hallway{r}~
The hallway comes to a split and you need to decide which direction
you wish to take. To the south is what appears to be a small 
kitchen. There is the sound of someone humming coming from
that direction and the smell of freshly baked bread feels your
nose. To the north the hallway bends into an end. There is a 
large grey door blocking you from seeing what is past the next 
room.

{R}End of the hallway{r}~
Walking north you come to the end of the hallway. There is a
large grey door to your east which has a glowing silver lock on
it. On the north wall there is a large picture of a great lion
whose mane is like no other you have seen. You can tell by his
posture and graceful statue that he is truly a king of his people.

picture~
A mighty lion stands before a great stone table in an open field.
Animals of all types gather around him and listen to the words
which he speaks. His paws are larger than any lions you have seen.
And his eyes speak to you clearer than words.

{M}Small kitchen{m}~

 As you enter the small kitchen off the hallway you are getting
hungrier with each step. The table in the center of the room is
covered with a variety of freshly made breads and candies. Your
mouth begins to water as you spot the chocolate cake on the far
side of the table. All is laid out ready to be consumed. There is
a short fat woman blocking your way to the table. She seems to 
have her mind made up that you are NOT getting your hands on her
food till supper has started.

{Y}Castle ballroom{y}~
You are walking on the castle ballroom floor. There seems to be some
sort of festival going on. The ballroom floor is crowded with
creatures who are dancing and cheering. There is some quaint music
coming from one side of the ballroom. You can not see the source 
of the song for all those who are dancing. There seems to be an
exit on the far corner of the room. Perhaps you should head for it.

{RED}Stairway to the Dungeon{red}~

Wow! Who would have thought there to be a dungeon directly under
the ballroom floor?!? You are on a set of stairs leading downward
into darkness. The air is cooler here and feeled with the stinch
of mold. The stairs are made of a heavy stone and have a damp
coating to them so it is best you be careful with your steps.

You have reached the dungeon level of the castle. There are two
dungeon cells. The one to the east seems to be rather crowded.
However the cell to the south has only one occupant in it.
As you take a step into the dungeon all prisoners eyes focus
on you and what you are doing. An eerie feeling inside you makes
you pause for a moment. Should you really be in here?

You tip-toe into a dungeon cell which is full of criminals who
have been brought before the Cair Paravel kings and queens and
found guilty. The prisoners do not seem to mind your visit.....
but that may be a bad thing!

As you enter the solitude of the cell on the south, you see a
tall shadowy figure rise to her feet. She is dressed in a long
red outfit and wears a bright golden crown upon her head.
There is a sturn look on her face letting you know she is of
noble blood. She undoubtably is the captured ruler of a distant
land.

Quiet Passage~

Exiting the ballroom floor you make your way into a quiet passage
leading to a small flight of stairs which lead up to the castle
tower. The air has a crispness to it as your lungs inhale it
more quickly with each breath as you climb up the steep stairs 
until you reach the top. To your north is the throne room
of the kings and queens of Narnia.

On are on a wide snowy path which cuts between the trees. You think
you can make out sleigh marks in the snow but there is not enough 
to know for sure. As you walk along you begin to feel as if the trees
are watching you.

As you enter the throne room of the kings and queens of narnia
you are in awe. Four beautifully decorated thrones line the front 
wall. There is a jester running around the room trying to entertain
his king. He seems to be doing his job well. A radiant light is 
pouring out into the room from all sides. There is indeed something
magical about this place.
