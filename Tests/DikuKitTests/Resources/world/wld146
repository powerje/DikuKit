     There is a group of rocks that cover the ground
     here and form a large wall.  It seems something could be
     living inside the rock, there could be something huge, maybe
     entire cities underground!  The stream flows down into some
     cracks that are in the rock formation.

{CYAN}A Gurgling Stream{green}~

    There is a stream trickling by here at a
    quick rate, making cute gurgling noises
    as it flows by.  The air is crisp and
    cool.  This area seems to be very nice.
    Beautiful trees cover a path leading south.

     It seems quite difficult to squeeze through the cracks to
     get out of here, it must not be very easy to get more than
     one or two people through in here.  The water level is quite
     high, it must've been running through this area for a long
     time, more ancient than any dwarven or human creation remembered,
     which is apparent by the way the solid rock walls are now carved
     up.

     This area seems to be above ground, which is definitely a plus to
     the weary traveler.  The water can be seen flowing smoothly in the 
     distance along its dark, cold  route.  To the east it is only possible 
     to traverse by swimming.

     The deep ebony of the rock ledges and surrounding cavernous
     walls is astounding.  This huge chamber is almost surreal and
     it is surprising how deep into the ground it is, to be this tall.
     Water drips and drops here and there making funny noises.
     It seems as if it would be quite difficult to climb out.

     The walls of the cavern slope sharply upward, making it cramped,
     but possible to walk around.  The glowing eyes of nasty creatures
     of all sorts peer suspiciously about themselves, waiting for fresh
     meat of any kind.  The air is quite fresh and nice here, even though
     this is an underground mountainous area.

     The rush of the water can be heard eastward, it is difficult
     to gauge where the water is in this darkness.  To the south
     there is another spot of dry earth.  Scampering small footsteps
     are scattered on the bare earth.  Rocks have crumbled on the
     ground causing an odd design on the ground.

      The water flows northward and several species of fish and

    The water flows at a comfortable pace that doesn't really hurt
    anyone swimming in the water.  Multitudes of fish swim by but do

    seeming to reach up from the bottom of the cavern.  It is possible
    to swim northward, southward, or westward.

     The tunnel is devoid of light and utterly clogged with
     debris.  It seems unlikely that any other people have ever
     been down here, but you know it must be so.  There are corpses
     of fallen travelers littering the bottoms of these waters and they
     don't all have a nice spring fresh smell to them.

     The current is kind of strong and brings all sorts of dark fish
     your way.  Some with envious burning eyes, others with dull passing
     notice.  All of them look dangerous.  The water seems to go deeper
     and deeper but it would be difficult to swim through the floating algea
     and other plant life.  It's a wonder anything lives down here at all.

    Nightmarish images of fish from this water enter your
    mind unwillingly.  It is impossible to shake the thoughts
    of the strange and unusually shaped fish of these waters.
    Some fish seem to make high pitched squealing noises that
    pierce the air and hurt the ears.  Several other species
    just swim around and bite the other fish in attempts to
    wound them mortally.

     The underwater darkness is broken by globes of floating balls of
     goo that are sliding off of the rock wall caverns.  The idea that
     you wont make it out of the underwater prison you are in is almost
     unbearable.  The tunnel leads north and south.

    The tunnel is completely full of water, if you couldn't breathe
    underwater you would die here very quickly.  It seems there are
    things that makes their homes around these surrounding tunnels,
    probably sluglike creatures that you only hear of in mom's old
    bedtime stories.  It could be said that all bedtime stories have
    some past basis in fact.

    A race of sluglike beings have lived in these tunnels for
    generations.  It seems they probably do not know much of
    any other type of species out there, and would therefore
    probably not look kindly upon anyone not of their race in
    this area that they've known as home for so long.

     The water is clearer here than has been the normal through
     the rest of the tunnel.  Now the fish with three eyes and no eyes
     are even more visible and ghastly looking.  The imagination could
     run wild out here with thoughts back to old horror stories and such.
     This really is an amazing under water place.

     The water smells of death and reeking corpses, there are piles
     of dead sluglike creatures stacked far below, at the floor of
     the stream.  Bottom sucking fish feed off these corpses with
     relish, and other more active fish are staked out by the corpses
     waiting to pick off unlucky bottom suckers.

     The water is saturated with murky dark gooey liquid with more

     The current is violent here and the fish sway back and

     their normal business.  The smell here is utterly disgusting,
     this may be some sort of sewage facility for the more
     powerful monsters that live here.

     The path is covered with wooden arches, which must be
     difficult to get this deep under the earth.  Many goblins
     give dark glances your way as you traverse the path.  It is quite
     a bit darker on this path than in the streets of the city.
     The path leads west into the temple or east back onto the road.

     The surrounding houses are carved straight out of the
     ground.  They look fairly broken down, but perhaps it is
     all a matter of perspective.  The goblins in this area do
     not seem to have a problem living here at all, except maybe
     with seeing you here.

     The Shchultzdeig was created during the earliest
     memories of goblin like creatures that inhabit
     this town.  Mainly to preach the word of the Dark 
     Khan, Lord Yamorigo.  For thousands of years this 
     temple has stood, without the likes of anyone non 
     goblin intruding on its solitude.

     talking going on here, the patrons seem to give you hardly a

     area.  Decored only by a dull glowing rock of some sort, and
     a table of blackened rock.  The servants of the Arch Minister
     do not seem happy to see anyone.  The Minister appears to have
     a pile of things to sacrifice located in a corner of this place.

     This is one not so luxurious brothel.  It would probably be better if it

     and ..erm, other things.

     The arena has a blood red mat laid out across it's
     floor, the walls sparkle with gems and crystals.
     The entire area is brightened by glowing stones
     that are in the sides of the walls.  The ceiling
     is quite short and appears to be dwarven made.  It
     is unlike any dwarven creation known to date.

     The wooden floor is covered with dirt
     and grime covers the wall.  The entire
     area is filthy, a lonely desk stands in
     the corner with musty looking dusty chips
     and flakes of wood drifting lazily on to
     the deeply marked wood.  On top of the desk
     there is a pot full of gold!

     The arena's mat has is tight and solid, feeling neat beneath
     the feet.  There is an urge to kill and destroy emanating from
     the soul of the arena.  The Druegar war cry is now in your heart.
     There are exits east, south, and west.

     to the east that doesn't seem to be capable of opening
     without the aid of some magic.

     The hallway is not as dark as everything else seems to be
     in this huge underground area.  There is a dark and broody
     tapestry depicting the slaughter of young Druegar dwarves
     in the early years of life on this planet.  The sad art
     of their culture has been lost to all the other races of
     the Northern Crossroads.

     The end of the hallyway has been reached, there are
     rotted skeletons and corpses of dwarf like beings
     resting on the ground. Paintings are strung from
     the walls and make this scene quite uncomfortable.
     The sadness of these people is palpable here.

      The Queen's chamber is filled with artwork of
      her people.  There is a soft hazy light around
      everything in the room, the wooden chair, the marble
      vase, it all seems to glow with a sad sleepy light.
      There is the scent of death in the air.
