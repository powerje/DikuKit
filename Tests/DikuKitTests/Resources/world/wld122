Xanthar's Place.~
You stand in a room that seems to hum with power.  There are vials
and pouches on almost every wall you see.  One wall is filled with
golden, glowing weapons that have some runes inscribed upon them.
In an old picture frame on the desk you see the great wizard
Merlin & another woman you don't recognize arm-in-arm.
Inscribed on the frame it says "Make me proud, Xanthar....."

  You are hanging on a rope high above Midgaard, and from here, it
looks as if you can see all of the glorious city.  Looking up you
notice the rope is bolted to a large, sturdy cloud.  How strange?
There is a sign posted here on another cloud beside you.

  You are at the beginning of a road made of clouds, and you find the
ability to stay upon this road puzzling.  You wonder if some unknown
magical force is holding you upon the road, and what will happen if
you stray too far from its centre.  You feel a breeze of cool air
blowing around your feet, and as you look down, you discover you can
see through the soft billowing clouds, but not clearly enough to see
the ground below.

  In the distance to the North, you see what looks like humanoid
clouds???

  You are being buffeted all around by the immense wind currents in
this room. You find it extremely hard to move, and no matter what you
do, you can't escape. 

  There is a Vortex in the center of the room, which seems to be
sucking in all the air around you. This Vortex could be the cause of
your dilemma, and if you can destroy it, you may be able to leave.

{W}Entrance to {BO,B}Witch's Tower{w}~
  You approach an ancient tower that penetrates the clouds from the
ground below.  Its sides are covered with a dark shadow, as if even
the sun itself is fearful of shining in its ominous presence.  This
tower definitely fits the description given to you by the Mayor of
Midgaard.
  His request was simple, yet urgent, 'You MUST save the children!'.

  Until you entered this room, you had no idea what danger the missing
children were in.  As your eyes scan the room, you are horrified by
the sight before you.  There is a stack of skulls in the corner, and
you can tell they are human.  You don't want to believe it, but they
look about the size of a childs head.  Much to your relief, you also
notice these skulls are old, and have been stored here for a very
long time.
  After debating with your companions, you all vow to destroy the evil
fiend who did this.

towards it, getting ready to annihilate the pest.
  The 'pest', knowing you didn't make the proper sign, rises off the
floor to its full height, towering over you, and attacks!
