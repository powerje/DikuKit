The Valley of Kings~
   Your feet begin to sweat as the heat from the desert soaks through your
boots.  Miles and miles of golden yellow sand stretch as far as the eye can
see.  The sun blazes brightly overhead and seems to cook your innards as you
explore this parched wasteland.

An Oasis in the Desert~
   As you enter the oasis you feel suddenly refreshed.  Tiki torches line the
walls in this small thatched hut in the middle of nowhere.  There are hand-
crafted tables of bamboo in each corner of the hut.  A long bar lines the
east wall and there is an old man behind it, smiling at you.  This looks
like a good place to rest for a bit and quench that thirst you've developed
trekking through the desert.

The Tomb of Tutankhamun~
   You approach a large stone slab that seems to be lying in the sand before
you.  There is a large inscription on the slab, but it seems to be in ancient
text and unreadable by you.  You marvel at the excellent workmanship of this
stone monolith, and wonder what secrets it holds.

The Valley of Kings~
   Your feet begin to sweat as the heat from the desert soaks through your
boots.  Miles and miles of golden yellow sand stretch as far as the eye can
see.  The sun blazes brightly overhead and seems to cook your innards as you
explore this parched wasteland.

An Oasis in the Desert~
   As you enter the oasis you feel suddenly refreshed.  Tiki torches line the
walls in this small thatched hut in the middle of nowhere.  There are hand-
crafted tables of bamboo in each corner of the hut.  A long bar lines the
east wall and there is an old man behind it, smiling at you.  This looks
like a good place to rest for a bit and quench that thirst you've developed
trekking through the desert.

lining the halls.  A giant likeness of Anubis stands on one corner of the
room.  You see now that the source of the shuffling was the King's bodyguard,
who was interred with the King when he died as a young man of 19.  The
ancient guardian of the crypt still stands at attention in the afterlife to
ensure that nothing can harm his master.

of the surface.  You wonder what left this way.  A low growling catches your
attention, and you swing your head around just in time to see a gigantic
Basilisk swinging its scaly head from side to side and snorting in your
direction.  You realize that this immense hole must have been where the
Basilisk tunneled in to his home here.

golden glow of a room filled with millions in gold.  You glimpse many pieces
of equipment as you survey the room from your perch, and notice, among the
other things lying around, a soy sword with no timer.

seen, you notice the presence of brilliant artwork.  Murals and frescoes line
the walls and golden statues carved in bas-relief occupy the space between
these beautiful reminders of a race now gone.  The whole gallery is lit by
a mysterious light that seems to emanate from a large statue at the end of
the passage.
There is a mural on the west wall here.
There is a frescoe on the east wall here.

Tutankhamun's Burial Chamber~
   You stumble into the great king's burial chamber.  As you regain your
composure, you look about you and notice that the entire chamber is sheeted
with solid gold.  A large golden throne sits at one end, and the pharaoh
rises from his rest to greet you.  The light in here is brilliant, and you
have to squint to make out the other side of this spacious chamber.  You
hear a soft dirge emanating from the walls, and the moans and wails of spirits
haunt your ears as you prepare to do battle with Tutankhamun himself.

At A Small Opening in the Sphinx~
   You have noticed a small crack in the foundation of this ancient figure,
and have dared to approach.  You notice the great architectural skill that
must have gone into something as monumental as this.  You peer inside the
fissure, but find it impossible to see anything but floating dust and more
sand.

A Cramped Passage~
   You enter a low dusty cavern that seems like a tight fit for even a small
child.  Dust swirls around you as you slowly creep your way towards the other
end of this small expanse of tunnel.

A Dusty Intersection~
   The passage emerges into a large underground sanctuary to thousands of
years of dust.  This room looks almost identical to the passage that you
just came from, only there is a little more room to breathe here.  As you
examine your surroundings, you notice exits leading in all directions from
here.

look around you, you notice a small fountain in the corner of the room.
As you approach the fountain, you notice a mysterious bubbling within.

The Guardian's Room~
   You enter what appears to be the living quarters of a very untidy
individual.  There is a hanging cot in one corner of the room, and the dirty
dishes from an old meal litter the floor.  A giant statuette of an old
egyptian king stands on a small pedestal recessed in the west wall.

A Crawlspace~
   You kneel down and enter a narrow crawlspace that seems to lead between
two large rooms.  Like everywhere else in this ancient monument, there is
an ample supply of dust to keep you sneezing for months.

A Damp Intersection~
   You enter a large chamber where the ground water has broken through one
of the walls of the chamber.  A steady stream of dirty brown water trickles
out of a large crack in the wall and flows around your feet to the north.
The whole room smells musty, and the stench here is horrible.

A Flooded Passage~
   As you descend the staircase to the chamber below, you slip and wind up
in pretty deep water.  There appears to be a half submerged exit to your
west, but it looks pretty risky.

A Watery Grave~
   You plunge yourself into the freezing water and you feel your skin
tighten up from the gnawing cold.  You glimpse a submerged sarcophagus and
some other strange artifacts under the water, but you cannot seem to keep
your mind on anything due to the numbing effect the water is having on
you.

A Winding Copper Staircase~
   You begin to ascend a large stair that seems to wind upward forever.  As
you begin to climb, the dust lifts, and you seem to be at ease.  The stair
is really a beautiful work of art, and you become romantically lost in
the curves and wondrous beauty of this arcane place.

The Top of the Copper Staircase~
   At last you reach the top of the staircase.  You pause for a minute to
catch your breath, when you notice an immense figure directly to the north.
The sight before you is link none that you have ever seen before, and you
wish you had time to marvel at the sights of this palace of wealth.

The Antechamber~
   You see before a room entirely shaded in scarlet hues.  Everything from
the massive obelisk in the west corner, to the sacrificial altar is draped
in luxurious red cloth.  A single candle burns in the center of the altar,
and you are stunned at how modern and orderly this chamber is compared
to what you have already encountered here.

Cozatacoytl's Sanctum~
   Cozatacoytl's sanctum is there place where Cozatacoytl, the Keeper of
the Sphinx, monitors all the mystical workings of the universe.  Before you,
you see a large crystal ball enshrouded in a fine mist of amber color.  In
this room, you also notice a gigantic throne that seems to be carved out
of the solid granite that composes this chamber.  A fine crimson mist seems
to float through a duct in the ceiling and intertwine with the radiance of
the crystal ball, giving the room an eerie glow.
