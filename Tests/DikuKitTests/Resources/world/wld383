{BLU,BO}The Caribbean Sea{blu,bo}~
{BLU,BO}
  The currently calm waters of the Caribbean Sea stretch
  for miles all around, dotted here and there by tropical
  islands lying far in the distance.  The sounds of combat
  on the high seas can be heard in the distance to the
  north, cannonfire echoing over the ocean waves.

{BLU,BO}The Caribbean Sea{blu,bo}~
{BLU,BO}
  All around here, the sights and sounds of combat on
  the high seas fill the air.  A large galleon
  exchanges cannonfire with an island fort nearby,
  while rowboats full of undead zombie pirates race
  towards the shore.  As you swim alongside the
  galleon, you notice a port-hole big enough to crawl
  through, used for firing the cannon out of over-
  head.

  As the waves of the Caribbean Sea flow into the
