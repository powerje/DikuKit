{G}East Forest{b}~

{G}  You stand in the heart of the Eastern forests, surrounded by the
{G}  mysteries of the sheltered world you have stepped into. You
{G}  recall word of a band of gentle elven rangers that roam the woods
{G}  freely, bound to no liege but their love for their race and its
{G}  inheritances, driven by a desire to preserve the wilds. Looking
{G}  at the mystical beauty around you, you begin to understand the
{G}  motivation behind them taking on this awesome responsibility.{b}

{G}East Forest{b}~

{G}  The wind softly rushes through the leaves, rustling all about
{G}  you. This ancient, stately forest is teeming with wildlife and
{G}  tall trees that reach high above, branches tangling to shut out
{G}  light. Whilst you tread in these enchanted woodlands, all time
{G}  seems to stand still in the wake of your footsteps. Silent
{G}  shadows whisk about you - some of them appear humanoid.{b}

You see the paintings of LOTS of dieing people. Behind them, there is an

{G}  Your fumbling hands and feet leave tracks in the moist dirt and
{G}  the dishevelled bushes as you press further on into the dense
{G}  woods. Forest birds perch and cock their feathery necks
{G}  haughtily, observing your passage through their territory. The
{G}  air is cool, moist and refreshing. Overhead, glimpses of the deep
{G}  blue sky beckon to you, reminding of a world outside and far
{G}  away. The gargantuan trees tower over you. Something in the soil
{G}  must make them grow those few extra inches.{b}

{G}East Forest{b}~

{G}  You step into a densely wooded area, with the thick foliage and

{G}  within the bushes to your west. The tall trees guard you
{G}  fiercely, strangler figs hugging tightly to their broad trunks.
{G}  This secluded corner of the woods seems particularly oppressive,
{G}  and the thorny bushes embed shallow gouges in your flesh as you
{G}  move within them.{b}
