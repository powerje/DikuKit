Entering the Building Grounds of the Universe~
  
  
  {bo,BLUE}There are many different substances all over the rocks and ground. Very 
  many powers were involved in creating this awesome pathway. A great fear 
  has come over you as you enter this great realm of power and construction.  
  The source of the whole world seems to emanate from the mountains around
  you.  All the universe's secrets lie ahead.  There is a faint memory of 
  a chemistry book in your mind, as though it may be a guide for this amazing 
  place.{bo,blue}

  universe tear the life of others away in attempt to gain
  souls for themselves.  It is the way life was first created.
  It is the way of the Elements.{bo,black}

  {WHITE,BO}Giant creatures fly through the air. They come ever so close to your body 
  that it gives adrenaline to your muscles. Luckily enough, you don't need to 
  worry about these creatures attacking.  There is an offensive smell coming 
  from the north.  Death is almost an eminent fate.  The wimp in you says to 
  go the other way.{bo,white}

  Once you move closer to investigate, a huge gaping crystal portal is 
  revealed.  You must have stepped on a trigger of some sort. Holding your
  breath and your bladder, you enter the crystallized structure. This must

{GRE}   This room has nothing you can use.  It is bare of all
   wall hangings or paint.  You cannot remember the last
   room that was as desolate as this.  It makes you
   want to shoot yourself.  Maybe you should move along.{gre}

  {bo,WHITE}The whole room is white.  It is lit by fluorescent lights.
  There are 4 beds in the middle of the room.  On each bed
  lays a bald, decrepit person.  They look so frail that
  they cannot even stand on their own.{bo,white}

   way out but the way you came.  It has nothing you can use.

{BLA}   You have found yourself in a seemingly disconnected room.
   The path behind you has somehow vanished. Now all you can see
   is a small patch of gray rock ahead. Walking toward what
   looks like a path, you drop a piece of your gear. {WHI}Sparks{BLA} fly
   everywhere. The ground seems to want to catch on {RED,BO}fire{red,bo}{BLA}. You
   grab your gear and continue.{bla}

{RED,BO}   You find yourself in a room with no exits.  It is clear that
   you took a wrong step.  A huge gleaming swirl of lights stands
   before you.  It growls as you approach.  There is a small
   plaque at the base of the mass structure.{red,bo}

{YEL,BO}   Wow! That was a hell of a fall...You mutter to yourself
   something about peeking.  As you look around, something
   catches your attention.  It is another one of those
   swirling masses.  They seem to always be where you do
   not want to be.  The large swirling blues, reds, and 
   cyans make wonderful patterns.  They create the illusion
   of a great funnel protruding through the ceiling.{yel,bo}

  {WHITE,BO}The room is wavering all around.  Neither the floor nor the
  walls seem to be completely stable.  All that can truly be
  seen is your body.  Your group seems to have disappeared.
  You wonder if this room is really here, or is it just a
  mirage.{bo,white}
