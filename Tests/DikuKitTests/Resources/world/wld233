{C}
   You are standing at the entrance to a huge skyscraper. It is hard to
believe that a global company could actually be the headquarters for a
more sinister secret. It is from here that the Zoanoids stage all their 
plans for world domination. It is here that you must make your stand. 
Letting the world know that a great evil is slowly taking control. They 
change us imperceptably and destroy all that we hold dear.

   You have entered a very large and very plush lobby. The abundance

murals possibly all originals. Leather furniture litters the entire area 
adding to the feeling like you need to be in a suit to even enter this 
place. It makes you wonder just how powerful this corporation really is...

down hallways and in the bathrooms. It seems that there is nothing in
this building that is sacred or kept private. The security guards that
monitor this room seem genuinely disturbed by your presence in here. You

as if there was a fight here recently. The flourescent lights are flickering
on and off giving you a very eery feeling. At the end of the corridor is an

It makes you wonder. Could there have been some kind of skirmish here and 
if so who would be powerful enough to stand up against this corporation. 
If only you could find them so they might help you.

open you can see the floor indicator blink softly as that same sultry 
voice you heard earlier confirms what it says...

can't believe your eyes as you see a person in some sort of body armor
attacking all of them. They are taking him on three and four at a 
time, however this seems only a slight inconvenience for him. As his
grip breaks the neck of one of his opponents the blades on his arms cut
another one in half. You marvel at the speed of the man as he destroys 
beasts one after another. Could he be the one that caused all the
damage you saw earlier? You see him pause for a brief moment as a gas 
vents from two openings in his mask and then he is coming after YOU!

   You look down and see that there is some grating that makes up the 
floor. They must just let all the liquid that spills from the tanks pour
down there. The grates look as though they can be lifted with a bit of
effort but looking through them you don't know if you would want to go
down there. It smells awful and every now and again you can catch a bit

   As you examine the ceiling a little closer you notice that instead 
of the opening that you thought you saw, what you actually saw was a
small beam of light coming from a small crack. It turns out to be an 
access panel that you easily slide aside and see that the light is
coming from a small holographic projector. It is aimed at one of the 
tubes on the floor and when you cut off the light beam you can see that 
the tube that you thought had a Ramotith Zoanoid is actually an empty 
tube with a disk at the base. The disk is giving off a pulsing blue 
light that you could not have seen when the holographic image was there.

in the room with it. The technicians here seem to be rushing to record
the events and make sure that not a moment of the event goes by without
some written or video record of it. They all look amazed at the power
and abilities of the creature as it dispatches enemies with ease.

another room. Maybe that one will be a bit less cramped and give you 
some better idea of where it is that you are. At least you know you can 
get back this way should any trouble arise.

   Thank you for visiting the Chronos-Japan Branch. For your continued
convenience these automated elevators will bring you to the first floor 
lobby. Please stand clear of the doors as they close and as always, Thank 
you for visiting Chronos Japan. After a moment the elevator slows and comes

   There must be some sort of large drain at the bottom of this reservoir
because the current keeps pulling you under. The sheer weight of the
liquid makes it hard to move around in. You can also see small creatures
swimming around. You had better hope they are friendly because you are
running out of breath and there is no place in sight to get more. You 
become a little panicky as you rush around thinking that there must be 
some way out of this place.

is a round shaped hatch in the wall. That button must be the switch

   It takes all your strength but you manage to close the access hatch 
to this tunnel before all the water inside drained out. When you finally 
catch you breath you look around to realize that you are in some sort of 
long tube. This must be an access tunnel for workers to drain and work on 
the tanks inside. It makes you glad that you were able to close the hatch 
or you might have been shot out of the end of this tunnel like a shell out
of a cannon. It gets a little lighter up ahead.

You hear a voracious sucking sound as the drain pulls you in! There is
no escape! You lose consciousness just before your body is ripped 
apart by the vacuum. Your last thought is that it may have been better
to drown.

   The walls of the tunnel look to be very clean. There is none of the 
dirt buildup you would expect to see if these tunnels were not used much. 
They must drain these tanks on a regular basis to check them out. You hope 
that they haven't got any work scheduled in here until after you get out.
The tunnel is still fairly dark but it gets a little lighter up ahead.

   You exit the tunnel to find yourself standing on a permanent platform
overlooking a small forest. The platform is attached near the base of a 
large mountainside. The entire inner complex must be housed inside this 
mountain. It looks as though you can climb down one of the water chutes 
under the platform to get to the ground, although from the look of it 
getting back up may be almost impossible. There is also a path to the east 
that runs around the side of the mountain.

   You enter a small clearing at the base of a large platform. The 
top of the platform seems to be just outside a small tunnel but there 
is no way for you to get up to it. It looks like someone could get down
through the slippery water chutes but could not get up them. Perhaps the
woods around here will prove more interesting.

   This path was obviously etched into the side of this mountain by the 
people who created the complex inside it. It is just wide enough to allow 
for the passage of small machinery and looks fairly well traveled. This 
must be the way the workers bring in the equipment they need to work on 
the tunnel and the tanks inside. The path continues to the east where it 
turns a corner and goes out of sight.

   As you turn the corner you come to a sudden halt when you see that the 
path you have been walking on has been completely blocked by a recent 
rockslide. Part of the mountain must have given way very recently covering
the entire path. Since there is no way to get around the massive boulders 
blocking your way, there are really only two things to do. You can either 
go back the way you came or try and climb down the rocks to get to the base
of the mountain.

{W}   You have come upon quite a peaceful setting. The woods here open
up into a small clearing that looks out over a lake. The water is crystal 
clear and is as calm as can be. You are jarred from your thoughts by the 
roars from explosions and trees collapsing coming from the east. What 
on earth is going on?!?!

failures when he started to make his {W}H{BLU}yper{W}Z{BLU}oanoids{B}. He tried to eliminate 
his mistakes but they had a nasty habit of not wanting to be removed. 
Their tenacity was such that he decided to use them for certain... "tasks"
that he had that he did not want to risk his prized {W}H{BLU}yper{W}Z{BLU}oanoid Team {R}5{B} on. 
After their last mission the team disappeared without a trace. It would

{BLU}will open up again at some point. One slip and you will go head first 
into the swift moving river. Besides, all this lack of space is starting

   You have entered a small alcove that must have been etched from the

{BLU}also see some pipes c{B}oming from out of the rock on both sides. That must
{BLU}be the reason why the c{B}urrent is unnaturally strong. They are blowing

{B}An Underground Tunnel{b}~
{B}
   What you thought was a small hole from above, actually turns out to 
be quite a large room. It has been excavated from the earth beneath a 
large tree. Before you can wonder who may have gone to the trouble of 
creating such a place, you are struck with the realization that you are
not alone. There is a very large hound, if you can still call it that, 
sniffing around in the corner. It is hideously grotesque in that it looks
like the outer layer of skin was removed from it revealing the muscle 
beneath. You can't tell if it is here guarding the room or looking for
something. Maybe you had better not stick around to find out.

{B}A Small Room Excavated from the Earth{b}~
{B}
   You have entered a small room that has been etched out from the
underside of a tree. Most of the ceiling is actually the root system
from the tree above. There are several make-shift tables lying against
the walls throughout the room. For all the rustic feel and simplicity of
it, the computers sitting on the tables look quite sophisticated. Why on
earth would someone with this kind of technology hide it underground.
