{BLACK,BOLD}Gate to the Castle{black}~

   Here are a set of{YELL} rusted and withered {WHI}steel
   gates{whi} that have withstood the battery of ages.
   They protect the path to the{BLA,BO} Castle of Lost 
   Souls{bla}, where all the lost and restless souls 
   of past warriors still roam. They will roam
   until they find peace and only then can lay 
   their souls to rest. The land around the gates 
   is barren and void of life. Only the screeching
   of the{YELL} rusted gates{yell} and the whistle of wind can
   be heard.

{BLACK,BOLD}Path to the Castle{black,bold}~
   
   This path leads straight to the {BLA,BO}Castle of Lost
   Souls{bla}. Silence still prevails from the{BLA,BO} black

   path ahead is getting more difficult. Careful
   balance and sure footing are needed to traverse 
   the path ahead.

   This path is blanketed in wet decaying leaves.
   The trees seem to twist into what appears to

{YELLOW}The Prince's Bedroom{yellow}~
           
   {WHI,BO}This is a room of great honors. There are medals 
   hooked to a suit of gallant armor. Many objects of
   war fill the room and walls. Battle scarred shields
   and swords of many types are along one wall. Staffs
   and spears are along another. There is a fire burning
   in the enormous brick fireplace. It has filled the 
   room with an intense heat and  a wonderful smell of 
   cedar. There is a large brass bed in the center of 
   the room covered in silk sheets. There is an outline
   of a persons body underneath the sheets. Further 
   inspection may help to tell who the person is.{whi}

   lived. It is clear that they had only the necessities
   of life. There are rows of cots with thin bedding and
   blankets. There is little privacy for anyone who might

   marble of different colors depicting a star.
   In the center of the star is a {BLUE,BO}plaque{blue}{WHI} which 
   is a little hard to read do to the thick layer
   of dust. A huge set of doors are open to the
   south. Two statues of warriors sit to either
   side of the doors. The throne is clearly 
   visible from here.{whi}

   A fine mist fills the room making the keep
   seem a little darker than the lower floors.
   A odd stench follows the wind into the keep.
   Nests can be seen in the rafters, but the
   birds have long left them behind. The creaking 
   of old wood and moaning of the night wind can
   be heard  echoing through the stairway.{yell}

{CYAN}The Moat's Tower{cyan}~
     
   {WHI,BO}Many windows cover the stone walls of the tower, 
   one of which is a huge {RED}s{BLU}t{YELL}a{GREE}i{CYA}n{MAG}e{BLA}d {WHI}glass window that 
   showers the whole room with a {RED}r{BLU}a{YEL}i{GREE}n{CYA}b{MAG}o{BLA}w {WHI}of colors.  
   As the wind blows a window open, eerie sounds 
   pour from the castle off in the distance. The 
   screaming of the sea gulls above fill the empty 
   room of the tower. Suddenly there is a calming 
   breeze of cool air. This place seems as if it 
   would make a decent resting place.{whi}

{CYAN,BOLD}Under the Moat{cyan}~
              
   {CYA}The water is cold and murky with all manners of debris
   floating about. It could be trash dumped from the windows
   of the Castle by the staff, or it could be parts of bodies 
   of those who have dared attack the Castle. The Moat continues 
   across the front and sides of the Castle. The channel of
   water seems endless.{cyan}

{CYAN,BOLD}Under the Moat{cyan}~

   {CYA}There is a fine oily film that rests upon the top 
   of the water. Beneath the surface small fish and a few 
   pieces of refuse can be seen. The sand on the bottom 
   of the moat is not what it appears to be. Like tiny 
   daggers, shards of crystal lie waiting to impale the  
   feet of intruders. Shades of {GRE}d{GRE,BOL}a{gre}{GRE}r{GRE,BOL}k{gre} {GRE}g{GRE,BOL}r{gre}{GRE}e{GRE,BOL}e{gre}{GRE}n {GRE}seaweed{gre} {CYA}can be

{CYAN,BOLD}At the Edge of the Moat{cyan}~
   
   {CYAN}The moat is dimly lit by the moonlight. Flicks
   of{WHI} silver{CYAN} bounce off the shallow water. Otherwise,
   the darkness seems enormously oppressive here.
   The moat, too dark to make out what is lurking
   beneath the surface, is dank and the rocks that 
   line the edge are slime covered.  Faint sounds of
   breezes rustling the leaves on the ground and in
   the old distorted trees are all that can be heard.{cyan}

   {CYAN,BO}The trail has spread into a new direction. There is 
   movement from the nearby woods every so often. A fresh
   bout of evil laughter comes in on a chilling breeze.
   It echoes off the trees, refusing to die. The  new path
   to the west leads to a large moat while the path to the
   north continues on.{cya}

{WHITE}The outskirts of the{white} {BLACK,BOLD}Black Forest{black}~
   
   {WHI,BO}Little light penetrates the dense tree line of the 
   forest. The path seems to lead into total darkness. 
   With the occasional breeze, there is a faint sound 
   that drifts in. It's reminiscent of a spine tingling 
   diabolical sound. There is a path opening to the north 
   into the dense, dark forest. The smell of death is 
   thick in the air. A fine moisture covers everything 
   around the area.{whi}

{YELLOW}Standing by a great oak tree{yellow}~
     
   {YELL}This is the largest tree in the forest. It stretches
   high overhead. The gnarled limbs hang high above like 
   grasping hands waiting to strangle trespassers. The
   bark is rough and blood stained. At the roots lie a
   fallen hero. His body well along in decomposition, but
   the cause of death is obvious. This foolish hero has 
   been decapitated. There is a particularly noticeable 
   {WHIT}knot {YELL}under a low branch where his head used to be.{yello}

   {WHI}A prefectly rounded extension of the tree. It 
   looks as if a branch has been cut from the tree
   with a man made tool. This knot is not formed 
   from the bark of the tree like the others. The
   most peculiar thing about the knot is, there is
   a triangular{whi} {YELL}hole {WHIT}in the middle of it.{whi}

   the great oak tree. Sparse vegetation manages 
   to grow in the small pockets of soil throughout
   the ravine. A faint glow can be seen coming from
   the tiny m{BLU}u{GRE}s{BLU}h{GRE}r{BLU}o{GRE}o{BLU}m{GRE}s all about the ravine floor. A
   musty smell of rotted wood fills the air.{gre}

{BLUE}The Dark Heart of the Woods{blue}~
   
   {CYAN,BO}In the heart of the woods, things are strangely calm.  
   But it is the calm before the storm. In the soft earth
   hoof marks of a horse can clearly be seen. Around the 
   hoof marks the earth is s{RED}c{CYAN}o{RED}r{CYAN}c{RED}h{CYAN}e{RED}d{CYAN} as if by a hot flame.  
   Looking around there are signs of a struggle. Someone
   placed their bets against whatever made the hoof marks,
   and lost.

{BLUE}A Dead End{blue}~
     
   {WHI,BO}This portion of the forest is blocked by a towering wall. 
   It is an imposing mass of cold, smooth, black granite. 
   So near the vile castle, this is not a place that travelers 
   should wander into. Further inspection reveals {CYAN}a small 
   {WHI}rock out of place. It looks as if something could have
   been {CYAN}hidden {WHI}there. Maybe even an {CYAN}entrance {WHI}to the castle.{whi}

{CYAN}Atop of the Tower{cyan}~

   {CYAN,BOLD}As the doors to the top of the tower open, the warmth 
   of a grand fire expands throughout the room. The east
   wall is adorned with well stocked bookcases. The north
   wall has a rather quaint and cozy{cyan} {CYAN}sofa{cyan} {CYAN,BOLD}with a side table.
   The west wall is adorned with a coat of arms and an
   impressive sword collection. In the center of the room 
   is a round table with six chairs around it. In the middle 
   of the table stands a vase filled with fresh roses.{cyan}

   {BLACK,BOLD}This is where food was kept when the 
   castle was thriving. All that remains
   now is empty boxes and cobwebbs. Fallen
   shelves lie about the floor. Empty flower
   sacks are scattered around the floor. 
   The dampness has cause the stone wall to
   start to crumble. Small rodents scurry 
   about looking for food.{black}

   {RED,BO}The kitchen of the castle has many cabinets.
   There are four large ovens against the north
   wall. Cookware hangs from the ceiling and is
   scattered around the countertops. Broken glass
   glistens on the floor as light reflects off of 
   it. Many great meals were prepared here.{red}

{BLU,BOL}The Hang Out{blu}~


   {WHI}It seemed as if you had been wandering lost for days when you 
   happened upon this place.  All your worries melt away the longer
   you stand here.  Soon you don't remember why you were lost in
   the first place or what you were searching for.  An oh so 
   comfortable looking couch beckons you to rest on it.  The moment
   you rest your weary bones three beautiful women appear, eager 
   to massage every part of your body.  You don't ever want to 
   leave this wonderful place.{whi}
