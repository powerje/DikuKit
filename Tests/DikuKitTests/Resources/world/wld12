{BO,C}The Sanctuary of the {bo,W}+{BO,B}Darknights{bo,W}+{w}~


   {BO,CY}You find yourself in complete darkness, your senses void of any
   feeling. You reach out into the darkness, only to find yourself
   encased completely in a pit of space. Your pulse quickens as
   sounds of agony and despair begin to fill your ears. As you stand
   before the portals that lead to the outside realms, you hear
   antagonizing screams.  They only remind you that you are entering
   the mortal world and the safety of the Sanctuary is behind you.{bo,cy}

s,4w,3s,2
Started by killing people bocking way.. when I got to the locker room
bench warmers were not aggressive so I blinded then killed them, they
wandered in and out of the rooms... I hunted "player" and killed the
aggressive/wandering hockey players after getting skates from the
equipment room, and a hockey stick key from another equipment room
room descriptions told me where they were.. right outside the rink.
I killed both goalies, one to the north had pads, the one to south
blocked way to the comissioner....  I hunted manager after clearing
the locker and the ice skating rink.  reporters are aggressive the
cameramen weren't. I killed some more bench warmers, and killed a 
mob that I got to when I typed the following commands: "hunt manager, 
hunt, hunt". Back at the  beginning of the zone I killed a punk then 
went up the vent and down the boards, and got a key... then I killed 
a piece of turd, not sure if there was a hidden room over there though.

   You are in a great room in the center of the sanctuary.  It is
   adorned with lavish comforts known only to those of this realm.

   It is here, under the protection of the dark crystal that you may
   regenerate yourself and rest for the coming battles.  You feel at
   ease here and know that your brethren stand strongly behind you. 
   No battle shall ever be fought here without the bloodshed and
   deaths of those who dare to enter here uninvited.

As you look out the sliding glass you see the jaccuzie that was tailor made for 
War.  You notice that there is steem comming from the surface of the water.
And one could imagine that the water temperature is set to a perfect 99 degrees.
Upon further examination you notice that the door to the jaccuzie is locked.
And that darn key is just not to be found anywhere.  It is juat as securly 
fasten as the cabnet door to the bar.

wetbar~
On the opposite wall from the fireplace there is a built in wetbar.  This bar 
comes complete with a fully stocked liquer cabnet.  But you notice that the 
cabnet doors is locked and no matter how hard you try to pry it open it just
wont budge.....(hey this is not your dads liquer cabnet this is WAR'S private 
stock).
~

fireplace~
As you gaze into the fireplace you notice that it has hipnotic powers.
Obviously just the way that War wants it.  It is a magnificent fireplace
that houses a beautiful fire that will burn forever.  All through those winter

{BOLD}{BLUE}Meeting Chamber{bold}{blue}~
{BO,C}
   You are standing near the center of a large marble meeting hall.
   There are intricate carvings on all the exposed surfaces, depicting
   ancient battles won by the brotherhood.  In the center of the room
   lies an enormous stone table, seemingly carved from the very earth
   where it sits.  Over the doorway to the west hangs a painting of a
   beautiful blonde woman, you are stunned by her beauty though the
   painting is obviously very old.  Perhaps this is a portrait of an
   ancient heroine, or just a fancy of Lord Molecular.  No one shall
   ever know.....    Over the North wall hangs a tapestry with the
   symbol :

                             {bo,C}+  {BO,BLU}D  K  {bo,C}+

                          {BO,M}"Keep The Faith"{BO,C}

   This is where the Darknights discuss clan business and prepare for
   upcoming battles and quests.

   You walk into the room and marvel at the tranquility of it all. All through
the room hangs large tapestries depicting a great many battles. The same person
is depicted in all of them, but no. There are subtle differences within each 
of the people pictured. Perhaps they are related in some way...
   As you make your way through the room your questions about the tapestries
are answered for there in the center of the far wall is the largest of them
all. It is a tapestry depicting the God {BLU}Demnos{B} in all his glory. The faces 
that you have seen throughout the other tapestries mirror his own. It is then
that you realize that all the others are his avatars sent to the mortal realms
to spread the word of his faith. They are but splinters of himself existing
with but a thought.

{BOLD}{BLUE}An Empty Tomb{bold}{blue}~
{BOLD}{CYAN}
   You are standing in an immense domed room.  The flames of the
   sconces flicker along the intricately textured reliefs in the walls
   and ceiling.  There is an empty sarcophagus in the center of the
   room.

   The room has been painstakingly prepared for the eternal resting
   place of a fallen Dark Knight.  You hope that you will not see this
   room soon, but pride fills your heart at the prospect.

{BO,BLU}A Dimly Lit Stone Corridor{bo,b}~
{BO,C}
   You find yourself walking along a long dark corridor deep
   within the halls of this great fortress.  The walls are made
   of large coarsely textured stone, and are cold to the touch.
   You can see the dim flickering of sconces, and the warmth of
   the light plays about the soft folds of the tapestries hung
   along some of the walls.

{BOLD}{BLUE}The Lair of the Dark Knights{bold}{blue}~
{BOLD}{CYAN}
   The dark ebony walls seem to push in towards you.  Above is a
   small globe of light that helps to light your path along this massive
   chamber.  Your soul is filled with dread as a faint scream can be
   heard echoing off the dark walls.  To the west you see a small
   stream flowing freely down a trench at the base of the western
   wall.  This is the land of the Dark Knights. This is the land where
   boys are made men,  and where fear has no place.

{BOLD}{BLUE}The Shrine of the Darknights{bold}{blue}~
{BOLD}{CYAN}
   As you enter this room you fall silent in reverence.  About you are
   the monuments of past heroes.  These are the great leaders who
   came before you, and who shed their blood and lost their lives
   striving to uphold the standards of the Darknight.
