{BOLD}{GREEN}Outside Terminal 1{bold}{green}~
{BOLD}{WHITE}The shuttle bus comes to an abrubt stop and the doors open.
You barely step off the bus, and the doors close as it speeds away. 
You are surrounded by a crowd of bustling passengers, taxi cabs and vehicles.
Everyone is in a rush to get out of this chaos, and into the even crazier 
turmoil that is Terminal 1. The inside of the terminal is to the north.

{MAGENTA}{BOLD}Hey guys!! Wussup? thanks for comming to visit me at school.
Don't let the punks scare you, they are wimps when they are alone, but tend to
be brave when there is more then 2 or 3 of them at once. But hey it's not 
like you guys can't handle em!! 8) You can find me in the library, I'm 
finishing an essay on one of the computers. See you inside!

The temple below you is thousands of years old.
It's buried beneath thousands of years of growth. Moss and grass
are all that is visible. There does not seem to be a way in from here.

{BOLD}{GREEN}Inside Terminal 1{bold}{green}~
{BOLD}{WHITE}Wow! This place is the epitomy of chaos!! What a mess!!!
Everywhere around you, there are passengers hurrying about 
in hopes of finding the right checkin counter. Adding to
the confusion, is the sheer lack of space. This terminal
is very small. But it houses about 3 times the ammount of
traffic daily then what it was built for. To the north, 
you can make out lineups.. probably for the checkin counters.
To the east and west, the terminal continues.

{BOLD}{RED}Remain on the path if you have any brains
and spare you the many of anguish and pains.
Be warned and be weary from all those remains.
those lost from the path are the deadliest's gains.

But be carefull still on the path of which I speak
for even here the TANGLER does sneak
no man has met one, and about it lived to speak.

BEWARE THE TANGLER!!!!!

Lost in boxes you find youself now
Not even a clue as to why nor how.
What lays beyond this maze of dust.
The answer lies in what for you lust.

When searching for something and far from the start
with a list in your hand and a product filled cart.
the contents the dinners of nights yet to come.
but added to cost shall make you succumb.

The extras that make it a tatter to pay.
but failure to pay them will make life dismay.
