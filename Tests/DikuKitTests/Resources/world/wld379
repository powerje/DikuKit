In front of the Command Post~

     Here you are standing infront of the command post 
     waiting to sign a wavier.  Can you even understand
     what this waiver says.  I bet a lawyer couldn't 
     even understand it.  Oh well just sign it what is the 
     worst that could happen?

     Great the orientation.  You get to listen to this kid
     tell you what you can and cannot do here.  No lifting 
     your mask off when your on the field, keep your barrel
     plug in when not on the field, blah, blah, blah.  Man
     this is starting to take forever.  When are you gonna get
     to start shooting people?

By the truck~

     Here sits a broken down looking truck that the
     place uses to haul their paint, guns, and other
     various things to and from the field.  Nobodies
     around see if you can sneek on and grab some paint
     cuz they seem to over charge for it here.

     here for quite awhile though.  Hey what's that just

Shady Hollow~

     Your now on the paintball field.  You look around and 
     see tons of trees, and flat pieces of wood that must
     be bunkers.  There are also bunkers made out of fallen
     trees and other various things.  Better get to the 
     starting base so you can start the game.
