Entrance to the Labyrinth~
You are standing in a square room, completly made of marble. The walls and 
ceiling are totally covered by beautiful and intricately carved inscriptions,
glyphs, and decorations that appear to be of elven origin. A drop of water
falls and lands on your head, dodging the next drop as it falls and 
dissapears into the knee-deep white fog that is flowing about. The doors
to the north, south, east, and west are also covered by the same stunning
elven carvings.

The Pit~
as you proceed along the dimly lit hallways of this maze a foul odor
assaults your nostrils.  Even a thousand orcs never smelled this bad!
you proceed, holding your nose and gagging on the stench when all of
the sudden your feel slip!  you find yoursely reeling and falling
into the darkness towards the source of the awfull odor.....


.....landing with a loud 'SPLUT' you are now completely covered with
a slimy substance that your nose identifys as dung.  as you struggle
to your feet to clean yourself off you notice several pairs of eyes
peering at you, greedily, through the darkness.  Even without a light
you can tell that these monsters are licking their lips, hungrily.....
...if lips are what they have...

Landing~
After climbing the marble steps, you are standing on a large marble
landing. Fantastic pillars, supporting a ceiling carved with
extraordinary elven writing and pictures.  Before you looms a huge set
of double doors.  They look to be made of polished steel inset 
with hammered gold and exquisite gems of all types.  the sun sets
in the distance, shining great beams of light between the pillars,
causing the gems on the doors to shimmer brightly.  You can almost
sense the pride that the crafters of these doors must have felt.

Arvanaith~
You find yourself standing in a delicate forest. Huge trees loom all around
you, reaching higher than you ever thought a tree could stand, with some
of their trunks having a width of ten feet or more! You cant see
the sky because of the large canopy of trees...but somehow the gentle sunlight
shines upon you warming your soul, taking your worries away. Tiny wildflowers
,delicate mushrooms, and sweet smelling grass cover the ground. Everything
here seems so alive that you can almost see it all grow.
Your ears pick up the gentle tunes of flutes and elven voices singing and
laughing, and the faint sounds of chirping birds being carried on the wind.
Could any other place be this peacefull?

The Long Hall~
This long gothic hallway extends far to the north, stone cut pillars lining the
tall walls.  Several huge rose windows, with stained glass of all hues, light
up the hall with magnificient colors, as the sun shines in. To the east and 
west there are tall arches leading into what looks like a forest. Above both
arches is a golden statue, resembling the most perfect and flawless elf you've
ever seen...it could possibly represent an elven angel. Listening for a moment
you hear the sound of laughter and the playing of delicate instruments coming from both directions.

Stairs~
A magnificent streach of stairs, cut of pure marble, extends away
from you. As you proceed up the stairs you notice that every five 
steps there are two statues, one to your right and one to your left.
All the statues to your right resemble angles and all the statues
to your left resemble devils.  All of them seem to be elvish
slightly pointed ears, tall slender bodies and long flowing hair.
As you proceed you see a sparkle on the landing at the top of the
stairs...was that gold?...
