{bo,Y} A Tunnel {bo,y}~
  
  
  {bo,YELLOW}This place appears to be a tunnel of some sort.  Rough-hewn granite
  forms the walls and ceiling of the tube, but the floors have been
  planed smoother. In fact, you can see a pair of grooves worn into the
  floor, perhaps by the repeated passage of many carts.{bo,yellow}

{bo,Y} Widening of the Tunnel {bo,y}~

  {bo,YELLOW}From here, the tunnel's mouth widens to the east where you can see a
  dim area, possibly a cavern.  You can occasionally see glints or
  sparkles from that direction.  To the north you see a doorway cut into
  the wall.  Piled outside the door are empty baskets, picks and shovels.{bo,yellow}

Kurg's Gem Purchasing Co., Inc.~
  
  
  {BO,G}Upon entering this small shop, you are intimidated by the two burly
  stone statues on either side of the door.  Even though their eyes are
  stone, they glare at you under lowered brows.  Behind a lavish desk a
  well dressed man shuffles papers, reaching from time to time into the
  pile of uncut gems by his side.  A placard above the desk proclaims the
  regulations of Kurg {BO,BLUE}Gem {bo,blue}Purchasing Company, Incorporated.{bo,g}

{bo,M} Vaulted Antechamber {bo,m}~
  
  
  {bo,M}The tunnel's roof shoots  sharply upward, relieving some of your
  claustrophobia.  A number of creatures are busy attacking the chinks in
  the walls with mining equipment.  A few of the greedy-eyed Kobolds dare
  to pilfer some gemstones, but are quickly chased by their pick wielding
  peers.  The thieves are politely persuaded to return the pilfered products.{bo,m}

{bo,BLACK} Path to Stable Ground{bo,black}~
  
  
  {bo,BLACK}Toward the far end of the slug's slimy cave there is a narrow corner
  which looks like there could be a way out.  The wall is quite rugged
  here and should be easily climbable.  Fortunately, the slug does not
  seem to have spread much of his goo in this corner of the lair and it
  will not be too troublesome to climb out.

{BO,BLACK} Domed Chamber{bo,black}~
  
  
  {bo,BLACK}The ornate corridor opens into an equally ornately carved chamber.  The
  walls continue to echo the wood panelling motif, but the ceiling of the
  chamber is a large dome, cut to resemble the facets of a premier
  quality gemstone.  Five doors stand at points around the chamber
  equidistant from each other.  Each has a unique seal emblazoned on its
  face.{bo,black}

  of a giant amethyst crystal.  You can see only the deep purple depths
  of this astounding phenomenon, making you wonder exactly how large this

  your entire body feeling parched and weak.  Curled around itself, a
  large dragon slumbers fitfully.  Throbbing echoes of the dragon's
  heartbeat and breathing fill the room.{bo,m}

  west, the mosaic shows the dragon with wings extended in flight.
  To the east, the dragon is lounging on a mountaintop basking in

  dragons peering down at you curiously.  {bo,g}

  surface are anything but slow.  Circling the schools of fish are young
  dragon whelps, seeking food.  Their tiny scales glimmer frosty blue
  when touched by the rays of your light.

{BO,BLUE}Isle of View{bo,blue}~
  
  {BO,BLUE}You are able to pause on solid ground here for a short time.  Cobalt
  blue barbs of sapphire are exposed from the lake here, a jagged edge
  but nonetheless solid ground.  Floating on the lake's surface are
  shining scales probably from the whelps fluttering around the lake's
  shores and spires.  Small waves rise and fall, lapping at the sapphire
  barbs and depositing a few more of the lost scales with each pass.

  {BO,CYAN}By this time the snow has become a steady driving fall, making it
  difficult to see more than a few feet ahead.  The wind buffets you and
  stings your eyes with thin shards of ice from the storm.  The sapphire
  spears have grown numerous, and you find you have lost sight of the
  dock entirely with their crowding.  The once sluggish waters of the
  lake have become slushy, congealing gradually into ice.

  inspect you as you alight upon its island.

  spray of rainbow colored light.  At some point the vein of clear
  crystal that surrounds you must reach the surface to be able to refract
  sunlight this far underground.  Gorgeous blocks and shapes of naturally
  fractured crystal decorate the cavern from floor to ceiling.  Your nose
  cringes at the scent of sulfur in the air, and the orange glow to the
  south overpowers the softer tones of the rainbows.{bo,white}

  next plateau with emerald.  Last are the pillars of sapphire bracketing
  a crystal altar{bo,white}
