{Y}The Grand Gate of Thalos{y}~


  You stand in the archway of a gigantic stone archway.  The two
  steel gates have been forced open and have rusted in place.  A 
  hollow gust of wind blows by you into the deserted, and seemingly
  destroyed city.

The Temple of Thalos~
    You stand within one of the most holy places in the realm. This
stunning domed temple once housed the city's worshipers en masse. 
Unfortunately, it succumed to the destruction brought on this city.
Long benches lie toppled and the altar desicrated. Large chunks of stone
have fallen from the walls and roof, sending sunlight streaming in on
you. A few books lie about, conveying to you a holy message in a
strange tounge. 
     Wind gusts through the four archways and howls and screams can be
heard from all parts of the city.

in which you stand.  Ugly and hastily made statues of the newer occupants
stand in front of the older ones, but the older beauty can never be veiled.
