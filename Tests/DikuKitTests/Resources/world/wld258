about as you enter. The little things seem to be tyrin to get behind that
big rock. The rock has remarkable lines on it and a crack running through
the middle of it's horizontal shape. Wait!! That's no rock! that is a 
giant oyster! You realize that is opens up to eat you.

Before the Pond~
  You see a pond to the west. This is the water that has been shining since
you got on the path. It doesn't look very big, but you have the feeling that
it is more than it appears. The ground here is very wet, almost like there is
water underneath. Your attention is drawn back to the pond as the water
starts to bubble and waves begin to form.

The Great Pond~
 Ahh, atlast you have reached this great body of water you have been seeing
in the distance. As you stand in the pond, you notice that your path from
the road has disappeared. Your feet seem to rub on something in the water as
you wade around in the pond. The water seems to be rising, either that or
the ground underneath is sinking. You feel something like a handle under
your feet.

  As you continue to swim down the corridor, you see that the doors to the
crew's quarters are open.  Maps on the walls give descriptions of different
lands and places you have never seen before. Maybe they will be of some
use to you later, but you ignore them for now. Ahead you see a bend in 
the hallway.

The Lower Deck~
  This deck is filled with engine parts and weapons that used to be used
while the ship was in battle on the sea. At the far end, you see a bright
light coming from a room that appars to be a closet of some sort. On the walls
are detailed maps and designs of the engine and all it's parts, but there
is no engine present. Someone appears to have taken it appart.

Before the Storage Room~
  Standing at the end of this deck, you notice what appears to be a woman
with fins here. A mermaid! She growls at you and is angered by your presence.
She swiftly comes at you with a fierce look on her face. The door is guarded
it seems by a powerful being.

The Storage Room~
  Finally, you have reached the long awaited entrance to the closet. Now, 
what was all that work for? As you gaze around the room, you see lots of
old buckets and mops, probably used for swabbing the upper decks. Other
cleaning supplies are still in their bottles scattered around the room.
This room doesnt appear to be used much.

land. As the path continues, you can see a large cavern in the distance.
You feel as if you are being watched as you continue onward.

Royal Foyer~
  The foyer is a big circular room that is lined w/ artifacts these mermaids
have collected throughout their jouneys. It looks like most of them are
extremely valuable, yet some so simple as a beer bottle. To them, it's
treasure, to everyone else, it may be trash. Almost anything sailors took
on their voyages, you can bet it is here in this room somwhere. All of the
items have their own pedistal and are in a glass case.

daughters. If you expect to get in there, you must pass the huge guard.
The room is decorated in fish nets and artifacts hanging from them. They
are multi-colored and are very high up.

are here combing their hair, fixing themselves up, and the others are just
chatting amongst themselves. There are many lounge type sofas around for 
them to rest on. A very comfortable room to say the least. The room's door
has long beaded strings draped from it as you peer back out to the hallway.

Tunnel to the Master Chamber~
  You sense that you are getting close to Triton, King of the Sea. You hear
his deep voice coming from the east. This tunnel is differently decorated
than the rest. It has more plush covered furniture and it quite a bit
more elegant than the rest of the palace. The tunnel continues east and
the hallways is back down.

  Triton's voice is getting louder as you approach his chamber. You sense
that you should proceed with caution as the guard approaches you and
inquires about the reason for your presence here. The rooms is a plain room
decorated only in simple things on the walls such as pictures of Triton's
wives of the past and present. The Queen's chamber is east.

collection of paintings on the walls that she gathered from sunken ships
and others that were given to her in praise to her. The floor is a soft
plush rug and it seems to move as the fur sways from the currents.

Before Triton~
  As you stand here, you feel his presence. Triton is near. The water flows
very swiftly through this room as it flows up into his master chamber. The
walls of this room are jagged and rough, obviously to keep those not worthy
enough to withstand the flow of the water out. You will most surely die on
those rocks if you lose your footing. The guard is here and is instructed
not to allow anyone to pass without written permission from Triton himself.
You better think twice before attempting to pass him.

Triton's Master Chamber~
  At last! You finally pass and now stand before the great Triton, King
of the Sea. He did not invite you here and now he is angry. As you gaze
into his eyes, you can see the firey red glow as it pierces into your
soul. He towers above you and is bigger than any creature you have come
upon thus far in your journey beneath the sea. You realize that you cannot
escape his wrath. You now understand why he is king and why you should not
have come.
