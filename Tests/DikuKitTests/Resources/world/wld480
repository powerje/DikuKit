    Piles of stone that have fallen off the wall are
    scattereed about the edges of the courtyard.  The 
    ramparts look as if they are about to collapse, as
    do the towers.  The whole castle is in awful
    condition, except for the gatehouse...

{BLA,BO}Stairs to the Ramparts{blink}~
 {BLACK,BO}
    A set of ancient, crumbling stairs leads up
    to the ramparts of the wall.  The steps
    are cracked and worn, and look as if they could
    collapse at any moment...

   The higher you go on the steps, the more the stones seem loose, and a bigger sense of
   fear grows in you.  The top is in sight now, there is only a few steps to go...

    You finally reach the top, only to find

   The gatehouse is in sight, the old wooden door hangs on one hinge and looks

{BLA,BO}Inside the Gatehouse{blin}~
{BLA,BO}
   Inside the gatehouse, the air is fresh, not moldy and old as it is outside. 
   Somehow you traveled back through time to when the Ghosts-yet-to-be were defending 
   Bel-azar from the Nadir, and Tenaka Khan.  Four heroes, Chareos, Magrigg, Finn, 
   and Beltzer have taken refuge here.  Careful not to let them mistake you for
   a Nadir.

   Darkness.  All you see is darkness.  The darkness is getting inside you.
   Emptying your soul.  You wonder if this is what it is like to be dead.  
   You feel a dangerous presence about, a malicious, malevolent presence.
