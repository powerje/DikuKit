The Sidewalk.~
 
   The city has gone really crap. The only stores
   that are still open is that little diner down the way and
   the laundry mat accross the street. But what is this...
   A video game store! WOW! I have never even seen this
   building before.....

Outside "Video Game Heaven".~
 
   Even on this beat down dingy street this building
   seems to have some kind of glow to it. You can see a little
   old man inside that looks like he belongs in an old folks
   home, not in the middle of thousands of video games for
   your favorite gaming systems.

   Falling out of the tube you land in a familiar but
   foreign land. That's some sort of battle arena, isn't it?

   Ahhh man. You would think the acid would take

   You never know this stuff stinks so much until you are
   really here. The swinging chains look pretty dangerous.
   Better stay clear of them. Looks like someone is at the
   end of the bridge. Keep your balance and pay no attention
   to the acid, it might make you fall. Is that who I think
   it is? Yeah, it is. Well I guess if you can spit acid
   you might as well hang around an acid pool.

Death!~
 
   Dim light shines down from the cave opening above.  The cool, damp air of
   this cave reeks of the smell of sweat.  Ancient cave paintings fill the
   walls, illustrating great warriors with powerful weapons in battle.

A Cruddy Parking Lot.~
 
   Looks like this is the hangout for all the low
   lifes and drug dealers. Along the buildings there are
   some kids playing with a ball. And it's sad to see that
   not twenty feet from them three guys seem to be dealing
   some kind of drugs. This part of the city really has gone to pot.

In The Temple.~
 
   It seems we are in a temple of some sort. I don't
   know where we could be. It looks very familiar. What's that
   off in the darkness? Some kind of flame, or something. Looks
   a little spooky and dangerous! Everyone watch your back!

The Bio Factory.~
 
   You have got to be kidding. We are, no we aren't,
   YES WE ARE! We are in Goldeneye, 007! Well at least James
   Bond will be able to help us out of here. After all if he
   attacked us im sure he would fail his mission. Lets find him!
