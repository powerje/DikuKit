{BOLD,YELLOW}On the grounds of the Xavier Institute{bold,yellow}~
{B,YE}
   As you enter the estate of the Xavier's School for Gifted 
   Students, you are greeted by a magnificent display of modern 
   architecture. Everything seems to be pretty peaceful, until you 
   step across a discolored concrete step. Just as you are about to 
   turn around and go back, the mansion's automatic weapons systems
   go online and you are under attack! What was initially a large
   area of grass has suddenly become a large area with turrets 
   coming out from the ground, ready to fire at will.

     As you make your way up the stairs, you see strange pieces of 
     art placed at certain areas of the stairs. On one side, you notice 
     what seems to be a decapitated robot head, bronzed and on display. 
     On another section of the staircase, there is a large, brightly glowing 
     red stone emanating great power, placed in a glass container. The 
     stone is drawing you in to break it free, but you realize that breaking 
     the glass might sound the alarm.

     Looking around the third floor of the mansion, the hallways are a 
     bit smaller than the previous floors. Yet from the outside of the

   You have entered a secret room in the back of the mansion. Surveying the 
   room you notice that this room is enhanced with special alien equipment 
   that only one special mutant in the world can understand. Looking down 
   at the console, one name pops out that you can understand, Lilandra. 
   Rummaging through the drawers, you found a diary entitled "The Xavier 
   Protocols." Curious, you open up the book and start reading the entries. 
   Each page of the diary talks about certain students in the institute and 
   how to disable them someday, if they ever went out of control. You close 
   the diary and place it back into the drawer.

   This is rather odd compared to the rest of the mansion. You walk in
   further to get a closer look. Suddenly, you hear a voice shoot out of 
   nowhere.

{BLUE}
   Apparently the area behind the mansion was a former training ground for
   Xavier's students. As you try to run away from the Sentinels, a giant tree 
   grows out of nowhere and pushes you back down. As you try to stand up, 
   you hear a Sentinel coming your way:
{B,RED,BLINK}  
   "Processing last attack, adapting to mutant signature."
{b}{BLUE}   
   You manuever your weapon and brace for an attack but decide to turn
   around and run in the other direction.

{BLUE}Behind the Mansion{blue}~
{BLUE}
   Curious to see what goes on behind the mansion's walls, you jump the gate
   and enter into a dark, heavily forested area. In the distance, you can 
   hear metal clanking against other metal and whispers throughout the forest.
   This is rather odd compared to the rest of the mansion. You walk in
   further to get a closer look. Suddenly, you hear a voice shoot out of 
   nowhere.

{BOLD,BLACK}
   Cautiously you put your back against the wall and walk 
   carefully across to avoid detection from the mutant-hunting 
   Sentinels and other creatures hiding behind the mansion. As 
   you carefully walk through the bushes you hear a large *thud* 
   coming from below you. After close inspection, you see a 
   little knob covered by some dead leaves and twigs. Brushing
   the leaves and twigs away reveals an opening into the back 
   of the mansion.

{BOLD,BLUE}The 3rd Floor Hallway{bold,blue}~
{B,BLUE}
   As you wander through the hallway, you see various pictures of the 
   X-Men past and present. Each portrait exhibits a feeling of friendship 
   and camaraderie that is shared by all the team members. This section of 
   the hallway has a painted collage of a life changing event in the 
   history of the mansion and it's students. This wall mural shows a 
   titanic battle between Xavier's first students and his half-brother 
   Cain Marko, the Juggernaut.

{BOLD,BLUE}War Room{bold,blue}~
{B,BLUE}
   As you push away the hidden wall, you come up into a large room with a 
   metallic round table in the middle. Above the table is a state of the 
   art holographic projection system pointed directly at the middle of the 
   table. Pushing the switch below the table, turns on the machine and 
   reveals a three dimensional holographic representation of the earth 
   and landscape in great detail. On the far wall in the back, there's 
   a glass wall display showcasing costumes that apparently some of the
   members of the institute use on the field. One of the costumes on the
   wall seems to be ripped to shreds. A console on the east wall has
   cameras facing every angle of the institute.
