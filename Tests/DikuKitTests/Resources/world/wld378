{GR}Forest of Keldorran{gr}~
{GR}
  To the far north of the Forest of Keldorran is the Waste 
  of Shugg and The Krak. To the east, The Mountains of Kappah
  endure another cold snow-capped winter and send cold breezes
  through the forest. Southward is the Valley of Wendlock and
  Shaddi-Sampi as well as the Bay of Seboz. The forest itself
  is peaceful with the occasional interruption.

{GR}Kephren's Keldorr Tree{gr}~
{GR}
  With scrolls neatly rolled and stacked on the shelf,
  Kephren sits at his desk recording the {C}history{GR} of
  Krystonia.  Assigned by the Council of Wizards to 
  document Krystonia's history, {C}lore{GR} and ongoing tide
  of events, Kephren works day in and day out with 
  little time for himself.  Occasionally, his work
  enables him to travel to far reaches of the land.
  And sometimes, he receives visitors.

history~
{CY}
  There was a time with a single moon in the sky, and the 
  lands upon which its light fell were of a beauty without equal.
  Above those lands flew the birds of the air, borne upon fair
  winds, who brought music to those who dwelt below. The birds
  are no longer and the names of those who heard them are lost.
  We know them only as The Ancients...

lore~
{C}
  ...Fore there came from the darkness a new star. And in its
  passing the second moon came to keep company with the first.
  The shadow of the second moon called the seas to rise up and
  cover the lowlands and caused the very mountains to crack
  and tremble and issue forth with fire and thunder.  It was
  from their furnaces that the shining stones came to be. 
{C}
  Then came the dark coldness in which all the voices were
  silenced...

  The power of the DOM is overwhelming. The DOM's
  power is regenerated as smaller krystals are 
  placed here in the Krystallate Obelisk. As the 
  DOM drains their energy it absorbs their matter
  as well.

  When the Dom was discovered, everyone recognized
  that the Dom in the wrong hands would change
  Krystonia forever. Extreme measures were taken
  to ensure that its power would not be abused. The
  Council of the Wizards was formed of master spell-
  casters who would act in behalf of Krystonia's
  best interest. Since, the Dom's power is so 
  unique all races work together to ensure the 
  power never dims and that it remains under the 
  Council's control.

  of the room is designed as a horseshoe so that all
  in attendance might see and hear equally as well.
  Here in the center of the Obelisk away from the noise
  of students and lessons and practicing, the Council
  of Wizards meets to discuss which direction Krystonia
  will head as well as solving immediate orders of
  business.

  The archway leading into the scullery is high and
  allows for much light to enter the scullery. At one
  end there is a series of small windows, tall and
  quite narrow about ten of them. The floor is made
  of a smooth white stone and kept very clean. Along
  the wall there is a deep basin and counter used to 
  wash the pots and dishes. On the other wall is a 
  giant cabinet where everything is stored. A small
  closet filled will mobs and buckets stands in the
  corner.

  The Krystallate Obelisk was built with the finest
  of materials around and this kitchen was no exception.
  Here is this large kitchen, HottlePottle scurries
  about holler orders at all the help. On a slow day,
  there is no less than two hundred wizards to feed
  and this short tempered chef will not stand for 
  imperfection.

  The pantry is stocked with enough food to feed all

{R}Rueggan's Workshop{r}~
{R}
  For a wizard so bent on invention, one would expect to 
  find this room to be pristine and very modern. However,
  stepping into Rueggan's workshop is like taking a trip
  back in time a few centuries. The workbench in the center
  of the room is one built by Rueggan's own hand from a 
  combination of Keldorr and Cudha woods. The machinery
  was also devised by the great inventor. A small pile of
  glowing krystals is on one corner while brooms, shovels
  and dustpans sit in the other corner. There is no outside
  lighting in this room as Rueggan feels it spoils his 
  mood and influences his work negatively.

  prefers a quiet not as orderly environment and well
  that is how he lives outside the library. With work

{M,BO}The Study of Agoras{m,bo}~
{M,BO}
  Here in the study of Agoras, one will find a quiet
  old wizard buried deep in his notes. The room is much 
  like the other studies. Cudha wood panels the inner 
  walls while the brilliant glow of snow-fire stone
  makes up the outer wall. A tapestry of Azael hangs on 
  the wall reminding all of the Great Design and the
  reason everyone has a chance to study.

{MAG,BO}Kyrschen's Study{mag,bo}~
{MAG,BO}
  Shhh.... This is one serious apprentice. Kyrschen
  sit absorbed in her work at a large table made from
  a keldorr tree. Her studies appear to be herbal in
  nature. As a prized pupil of Wodema, Kyrschen pours
  over medical studies and herbal remedies.

{MAG,BO}Study of Rohan and Tador{mag,bo}~
{MAG,BO}
  Rohan and Tador decided that they were tired of running
  back and forth between their studies. And ONE study was
  certainly NOT big enough for the both of them. So with
  permission from the Council the two of them knocked the
  wall down and combined their studies. Working diligently 
  with Wodema, Tador and Rohan are often on the road studying
  the agricultural aspects of Krystonia. The hope is that
  they will produce abundant crops in the hot sandy regions
  of Krystonia utilizing the power of the Dom. This could
  mean a change in the lifestyle of the Maj-Dron.

{MAG,BO}Apprentice Hall{mag,bo}~
{M,BO}
  Before, after, and between classes, apprentices of all
  levels enjoy each other's company here in Apprentice
  Hall. The more advanced Apprentice can be found helping
  the Novice. The rooms if filled with laughter, sounds
  of poorly formed incantation. Occasionally, a minor
  disaster will grab the attention of a Master Wizard, who
  just happens to be passing by.

{BLU,BO}The Council's Dining Hall{blu,bo}~
{BLU,BO}
  The Council of Wizards gathers together in the dining
  hall to sup. They put business aside and enjoy yet
  another meal prepared by HottlePottle. Some more clever
  wizards 'magically' eat the meal or improve its taste
  when HotPot has his head turned. Whatever happens, ALL
  wizards know not to offend the hot tempered chef and 
  they would NEVER enter his kitchen.

  The tables of the dining hall are covered in bright

  large circle, so that all might enjoy the company of
  other fine wizards. It is not uncommon for the very
  particular chef to wander in and out of the dining
  hall ensuring that everyone has had his share and
  is satisfied with the meals served. To the north,
  there is a more private dining hall.

  yet. This box constructed from snow-fire stone uses the

  Just inside the Obelisk, it becomes apparent how

  comfortable. Wizards from all over Krystonia rest
  in the large leather chairs while others mumble
  words which are barely recognizable. Above the chairs
  on the east and west walls are pictures of those who
  served(past and present) on the Council of Wizards.
  Looking beyond the entrance, there is a long hallway
  with many doors and intersections. There is a large
  plaque hung high above the doorway entitled

Chasing passion into the night, all tangled in a dream

There is nothing I won't do
  Let me show you what it's like to lose control free the desire in your soul
Oooh let me love you
Let me take you to a place like nowhere else, show you the things you never felt
Oooh let me love you
  I want to taste your kiss, be the reason for your smile
Touch the magic on your skin, be the one that drives you wild
  Oh if you could read my mind, you'd know you're everything I need
You'd see yourself through my eyes, and you'd understand what I'm going through
And just how much I want you
  Let me show you what it's like to lose control free the desire in your soul
Oooh let me love you

Oooh let me love you            - Tim McGraw
