{CYAN}On the Bridge{cyan}~
   You are now standing on a bridge where many fierce battles have
 been fought. The stone blocks that hold up this massive structure
 have begun to decay, but they were well crafted and should hold up
 through the test of time. There is an Iron gate to the north. To 
 the east and west is a large pit. The bridge continues to the south.

{CYAN}On the Bridge{cyan}~
    You now stand in the middle of the bridge, covered in deep
 red stains, you can see that many have met their match at this
 dreary site. As you look over the sides of the bridge, you start
 to get dizzy from looking at the long drop to the surface below.
 You can feel the warm air wafting up from the pit below.

 you speed towards the bottom and whatever dangers may lurk there. You

   Luckily you missed landing on any of the many spikes protruding
 from the ground. Blood and gore are littered all around you, and
 the whole place reaks from the stench of death. Your in a deep pit,
 surrounded on all sides by rock except for the faint light to the
 south. The pit continues to the south before it ends in another 
 pile of rocks. It looks like it is possible to climb back up this
 rock face wall.

    You are on a wooden platform floating on what seems to be an 
 underground lake. As you look up at the ceiling, you can see the
 hole you fell through is too high for you to reach. To the east
 you can see another platform like the one you are on, but its too
 far for you to get a good look of it. Looks like your gonna have

   You stand in a large blood-stained battlefield. Entrails and other
 maimed bodyparts litter the area. Many battles have been fought here,
 many won and many lost. At first you are overwhelmed, but your warrior
 senses soon take over and remind you, Kill or be killed! You glance
 over your shoulder, then begin the hunt for your prey.

   You are now standing on a bridge where many fierce battles have
 been fought. The stone blocks that hold up this massive structure
 have begun to decay, but they were well crafted and should hold up
 through the test of time. There is an Iron gate to the south. To 
 the east and west is a large pit. The bridge continues to the north.

 red stains, you can see that many have met their match at this
 dreary site. As you look over the sides of the bridge, you start
 to get dizzy from looking at the long drop to the surface below.
 You can feel the warm air wafting up from the pit below.

   Luckily you missed landing on any of the many spikes protruding
 from the ground. Blood and gore are littered all around you, and
 the whole place reaks from the stench of death. Your in a deep pit,
 surrounded on all sides by rock except for the faint light to the
 south. The pit continues to the south before it ends in another 
 pile of rocks. It looks like it is possible to climb back up this
 rock face wall.

 in here, but there will be a corpse to retrieve. Also all maimed
 eq, or dropped items which you will want to retrieve will be in
 the collection room to your west. Be honest, only take what's yours.
 Taking other peoples gear will be considered the same as looting.
