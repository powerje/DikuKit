The Astral Plane~
You find yourself standing on what appears to be a circular disk here in
the Astral Plane. After all that wandering aimlessly, you are glad to
have found something other than all those strands. You wonder why this
disk is just floating here. Then you decide to examine it more closely.

disk~
This disk appears to be made of the fibers of time itself. You notice
an inscription on it:
"From my eternity springs a new dawn,
   Only those who pass this way find
out what it truly means to be alive."
Along with it, someone has scribbled the following:
If this makes no sense, it wasn't meant to.

A Floating Pathway~
This is a path that seems to be just floating here, as there is no visable
means of support. Yet, to your surprise, it manages to hold your weight. 
You wonder how this is possible. But you don't spend a lot of time pondering
it because you feel uncomfortable just standing here.

The Pathway Continues...~
You continue on the pathway, hoping that it will lead somewhere. You are
beginning to dislike the fact that it's freezing here. Out of the corner
of your eye you think you spot something that might resemble a building,
but you're not quite sure. You didn't notice it till now, but you
feel like someone has been watching you. You look down, and shudder. It
looks like this pathway may be made up of blood. That thought makes
you want to puke. You shudder and continue on.

of this cold. You feel like an icicle. Your breath hangs in the air in front of
you. Strange...you wonder if you still are in the Astral Plane. You yell, "hello?".
Much to your surprise, your word is echoed back to you. Maybe that disk you came 
through was a portal back to the Prime Material Plane, even if temporarily.

You look up into the sky, and much to your surprise, you think you can see those
strands you were walking on earlier. You wonder how that could possibly happen.
You vaguely remember going up from that disk, not down. Then you remember,
in the Astral Plane, directions are relative.

while the other, to the north. You could also go back east.

that's been bothering you seems to be out of sight for now, but you still
wonder if that could be the fortress you've been looking for. You push that
thought out of your mind. It's probably somebody's home, and not the building

Strange. You recognize these markings to be the ancient language of the
etheral druids. Good thing you paid attention in that class, as you

The Bottom of the Tower~
The hallway here has ended, and you find yourself standing in front of a 
heavy door that looks like it hasn't been opened in ages. As you examine the
door, you notice runes that somehow you can figure out what they say.
Basically a warning against trying to fight the High Lord of Darkness...whom
you can only assume is the current owner of this tower.

You find yourself standing at the foot of a winding staircase, made out of
a material you can't identify. You were nearly knocked out by the smell of
this place. It's the best you can do not to gag, as the odor is just plain
revolting.

these runes are also pictures of battle scenes between a black robed figure,
and what you can only assume to be some form of elemental...

still sense that awful odor. The corridor, much to your surprise, angles
downward. You're beginning to get a really bad feeling about this, but 
nevertheless, you continue on.

complete silence. This is very un-nerving, you're not sure weather to
continue on, or go back the way you came. To the east is an archway leading

center of some kind.

is getting to you more than you thought. That feeling you're being watched
has increased at least 10 times then when you were in the mountains.
Despite that, your curiousity drives you on.

Indeed, you are quite sure that you've come across what must be the religious
center of this fortress. Those runes and pictures you've been seeing could
be icons of some sort. The walls of this chamber have tapestries hanging
from them, picturing what must be the four elements of earth, air, fire
and water. On the floor you notice all four runes combined into one.
The chamber here continues into a much larger one to the south.

You find yourself standing at the back of a HUGE chamber that must certainly

the combined symbol of the elements again engraved in a seal that you are
now standing on. A sensation like being burned alive suddenly comes over you,
followed by a feeling like your drowning, being buried in a landslide, and
finally being on the inside of a tornado. It leaves you doubled over in pain
for a few minutes, then the feeling subsides.

see what must be the high altar. Shadowy figures mill about, seemingly 
ignoring you for the moment. You just hope they will continue to ignore you.

Plane.

quite a contrast from the rest of this place. There is a desk at the far
end of the room, with a man deep in thought. He looks up, snarls at you

link to the prime material plane. If it is severed, then you are trapped
here, never to see the realm you are accustomed to again. Pray the raiding
bands of githyankis are nowhere near here, it is said that their swords
can sever that cord. *shiver* The thought of being trapped here doesn't set

The astral plane is a realm of existance, just as that is true of the
Prime Material Plane, and the Negative Material Plane. The Prime Material
Plane is made up of the world most commonly known to the everyday mortals.
It consists of the elements of earth, air, fire, and water. It also
comprises the plane where most mortals will spend their entire lives, with
no knowledge of the existance of the other two. On very rare occasions,
the barrier between these realms of existance is very thin. At times, it
doesn't even exist. That is how, you adventurer, have stumbled upon this
vortex. Consider yourself lucky. Most mortals never find these connections.
Let it be forsaid, this is an area of chaos. The inhabitants of this
realm do not take lightly to intruders, and most likely will attack at
the very sight of those they refer to as "outsiders."
If you wish to read about these inhabitants, turn to part2.

part2~
The most important inhabitant of the Astral Plane is the High Overlord
himself. Legend holds that he dwells in a keep somewhere in the AP, but
as of yet, no one has survived to tell about it, or if they did, the
High Overlord made sure that they could never return to the Prime Material
Plane. Some say he transformed them into the denziens of lesser creatures
that now serve him, or left them in human form, but robbed them of their 
soul. They are more dead than alive, and serve him as slaves, more or 
less, in his keep. Rumor holds most he killed, but some he made his personal
guard. Such did these adventurers boldness moved him. Seldom does this 
happen though.
As for the other creatures, the most important ones are the High Overlord
and his brother...or brothers. Ancient accounts hold that he may have 
two brothers that hold as much power as their sibling. They command the
soldiers and the knights. 
The lesser creatures include the etheral wraiths, his witches basically,

the denziens, who are his pets. He also holds in his service a cleric,
and also a mage who serve as advisors to all the brothers.

The Astral Plane~
You find yourself standing on a very thin silvery strand in the astral
plane. You look about for something that can serve as a marker if you
get lost...but you search in vain. There is nothing you can use. A sense
of pure panic and terror sets in. The mist that is beginning to form only
adds to your fear.
