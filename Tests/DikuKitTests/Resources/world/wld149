Dead Tree Dungeon~

   This room appears to be empty, but certainly isn't any cleaner
   nor does it smell any better. The walls still have mould and
   fungus growing out of the wet, dripping cracks in the dead wood.
   There is a door to the east.

   You think you hear some strange noises coming from the darkness
   above you!

Dead Tree Dungeon - Entrance~

   You're standing in the entry room to Dead Tree Dungeon.
   The cave seems to be carved from the inside of that huge tree! It's
   moist and uncomfortable. There are nasty-looking, and smelling, moulds
   and fungi growing out of every crack and crevice.
   The only decorations are 12 statues placed around the room. The six on
   the left look like strange, screaming fish and the six on the right
   like angry lizards. There are doors to the north, east and west, and the
   cave exit is up some stairs behind you.

Dead Tree Dungeon~

   The decay and scumminess continues in this room, while the smell
   has, if anything, gotten even worse. There are small blocks arranged
   in 2 equal and even piles in the middle of the room, limiting your
   movement and creating shadows for things to hide inside. There's also
   a door to the west.
   Inside those shadows you see things moving around and you can hear
   the sounds of shuffling... something.
