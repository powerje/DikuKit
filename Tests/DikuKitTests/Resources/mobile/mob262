{CYAN}What a wonderfully enhanced GNOME we have here. His biceps excede my own...he must surely die!{CYAN}
~
{CYAN}Oh dear, this one looks pain full!  I think i should turn back
before he bites my ear off and makes a boot out of it!  But, what
a delightful looking pair of underpants he has braced on his head!{CYAN}

{Y}A dirty gnome!{y}~
{BOLD}A Gnomelit is hounding for your undies!! you must destroy it!
~
{BOLD}It looks like God's perfect example of stupid things that he created for us to massacre
It stares at you crosseyed and drooling hounding for you last pair of underpants to feast
on.  You silly little gnome is actually half the size of the average gnome so this will
be an easy victory!

{C}The mummified gnome is rotting away fast!{C}
~
{BOLD,C}This gnome has risen from deep within the earth of aged times and now towers before
all that passes its way.  It's had is even intacted with its wrapped skull, even though
it is ragged and smells disgustingly of underwear and pig's feet it still serves its purpose
That purpose no insane individual knows!  Nevertheless, this creature of death must be destroyed!

~
{Y,BO}Johnny is one strange character, he wears nothing else but a pair of underpants!  But
still manages to plant beautiful underpants trees for the gnomes...you really don't know
why he does the gnomes' bidding because johnny could easily squash them if he wished.
Then again he is wearing only underwear and planting underpants trees...you figure he lost
his mind many years ago!

{G}How can this old geezer be swinging from anything?!  Shouldn't he be in bed now or at
least a walker!  Boy does he look vicious and old!  He sits at the highest branch ready
to pounce on his next victim.  Oh dear, you're his next victim!  The geezer turns his
keen eyes towards you general direction his frail bonds and week muscles are about to pounce!
His mouth is slightly open revealing no teeth and nots of drool!  Look at that!  His gumbs
are razor sharp!{G}
