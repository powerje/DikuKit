fireball at it, and you just think .. uh, oh.

There is an old man sitting on the floor, you can almost see his hair turning white by second.

seems to be just as fierce, just in a more silent way.  He brandishes a 
small dagger, in one hand, and a strange device in the other.  The device
has two little spots on it where it appears you are supposed to put your
fingers.
