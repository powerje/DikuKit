bannor bloodguard~
Bannor, the Bloodguard~
A Bloodguard stands impassively before you.
~


You see a flat, unreadable face that shows no signs of youth or age, as
if his relationship with time is somehow ambivalent. He conveys such an
impression of solidity that it distracts you. He nods slightly toward you.

Drool Rockworm, the Cavewight~
Drool Rockworm cackles with insane glee.
~
A creature with long, scrawny limbs, hands as huge and heavy as shovels,
a thin hunched torso, and a head like a battering ram. His limbs are so
gnarled he can barely stand, and saliva runs uncontrolled from his lips.

Ur-Lord Thomas Covenant glares at you.

A gaunt and haggard face confronts you with piercing eyes and a 
scowling grimace. A ring of white gold and wild magic occupies one
of the two fingers of his half-hand. A leper stands before you.

A wicked cavewight snarls at your presence.

A tall man with a narrow face and a beard that hangs like a tattered
flag almost to his waist. He wears a Woodhelvennin cloak bordered in
blue, and a circlet of leaves about his head. He smiles slightly.

The demondim-spawn~
An evil ur-vile leers and smacks at you.
~


As black as night, with a long torso, short limbs of equal length,
pointed ears perched high upon its head, eyeless face almost filled
by gaping nostrils, it's mouth snaps like a trap as you near it.

his arms folded stolidy across his chest.

lord foul despiser~
The Gray Slayer~
Lord Foul, the Despiser demands that you grovel before him.
~


You locate Foul more by tactile impression than by sight. He is essentially
invisible, and casts and impenetrable blankness in the air like the erect
shadow of a man---a shadow of absence rather than presence. Around the 
shadow shone a penumbra of glistening green. He reeks of attar.

The Ranyhyn~
A majestic horse rears as you approach.
~
A great craggy beast, deep chested, proud-necked, with some delicacy of
pure-blooded stock and some of the rough angularity of mustangs. It has
a long flying mane and tail, and eyes full of restless intelligence.
