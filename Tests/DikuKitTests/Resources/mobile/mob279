Oven~
{BO}{B}The Oven{b}~
{BO}{B}The {R}Pizza {Y}Hut{y} {BO}{B}Oven{b} {R}is standing here burning the pizzas{r}.
~

   The Pizza Hut Oven is very old and rattles a lot. You can
   make out the rusted edges and missing screws. It has not
   been changed in 50 years, and it packs quite a hard punch
   when it comes to heating. It holds the record in burrito
   reheating time..... 2 seconds (charbroiled burritos).

{BO}{B}The{b} {BO}{C}dishwasher{c} {BO}{B}is standing here with crusted and dirty dishes in it{b}.
~

   The Dishwasher is an antique piece that has not been
   operated in quite a while. The door is rusted open,
   and the dishes in the dishwasher have been there for
   so long that the employees think it is part of the
   structure of the dishwasher. The problem though, is
   that it seems to fight any attempt to be operated.

{Y}The Dough {BO}{REV}{B}Mixer{b} {BO}{B}is here making more noise than it is mixing dough{b}.
~

   The Dough Mixer is one more of the many appliances in the
   store that has not been changed out and has been here from
   the time it used to be an italian restuarant. The joints
   and gears are rusted, and many of the corners have green
   stuff gathering. It sort of gives the dough it's special
   flavor.

   The Store Manager has worked hard (and kissed a lot of ass) to get to
   his present position and he is not going to give it up easily. He is
   also not going to give up what he has worked so hard to achieve and
   will do everything within his power to make sure of it. Even if it
   means using processed meat (from you or his workers) as toppings to
   save money.

   The make table workers take the time to prepare the pizzas
   they serve. They have to be in the right frame of mind, and
   they need to be well rested, so they can take their time per
   say... to produce that perfect pizza everytime.

   Standing here is one of the hardest working members
   of the Pizza Hut staff, he gets all the pizzas that

   used his tongue to polish some executives butt. (Well we all know

   The shift manager is here working hard. As always he is hoping

   Which for him means a lot more MONEY! The only money he gets
   to see now is the money that passes through his hands as he
   takes orders and cashs the customers out.

   his off days. This is so much of a regular job for him that
   he has dedicated himself to only the customers here. He only

   that she could probably take part in a gymnastics competition
   and win if she really wanted to. She is standing here putting

You see a reindeer, straight out of your fantasies. Its brownish coat is bright and glowing

specks on its back, and a short stumpy tail.
You begin to wonder what this reindeer is doing so far away from the North Pole, has global
