{B}YOUR DOOM{b}~
{BO}{B}Draped in all black, this man has only one thing on his mind.{b}
~

    He is dressed in just a pitch black outfit and as he walks, things
    die around him. He is so dark, even in the sunlight, you can't see 
    his features. Even the most powerful figure on the MUD cowers away 
    in terror as he is approaching. You can hear in your head, 5...4...
    3...2... as if it is coming from this monster.  He raises his hand 
    and points a finger to you. Slowly he raises his head and you catch 
    a glimpse of his two blood red eyes and his evil grin as you hear, 1...

    You stare at her as she floats down on a tuft of clouds. She looks
    very old in age, and appears not to pose a big threat to you or your
    companions. She then turns to you and begins to speak, as she does so,
    you begin to feel the energy drain from your body and into hers.

    As you drop to your knees in agony, you peer back up towards the old 
    witch, but find she has used all the energy she has taken from you to 
    transform herself back into a young and beautiful, powerful wizard.

    WOW! You are half blind as you look in awe of this flaming bird!  
    Jets of flame rise up from its body, burning anything it touches.  
    Its loud screech is as unbearable as the heat itself! You start
    to wish you would have brought a large bucket of water with you.
    Its HOT!!!!!!!!!!

    A weathered man of about 50 years, looks to be thinking
    deeply. "What must I do for the Land, and to acquire more
    riches..." he says out loud. Then he turns to look in your
    direction, as he flashes a gold toothed grin.

    your gold purse lighter, and your equipment less heavy.

    An Elite Palace Soldier walks about patrolling his parameter.
    This soldier is dressed in a thin suit of armor of mesh, and
    wields a curved blade. They have need for nothing more, and
    are known to many as the Sultan's elite assassins.

~

    There exists a group whose job it is to make sure the Sultans religious 
    interests are protected. They operate in secret, unkown to many others 
    within the land. Only the highest of the church hierarchy even know of 
    these groups, and they have been dubbed Holy Slayers. If called upon to
    handle an affair, they will act as the hand of god, taking care of the 
    problem cleanly, quietly, and often permanently.

    He looks like a regular genie but he is dressed in attire from

    As you watch him from a distance, he stands motionless, guarding
    some secret for the sultan. He is about 7'0 tall and he is wearing
    a black suit of armor, forged by the master arabian blacksmiths.
    Strapped around his back is a huge battle axe made of a red metal.
    He looks dressed to kill.

    This savagely beautiful beast seems to entrance you with its rhythmic

    your knees go weak. Running would be a good idea if you could. Though
    several of these beasts surrounding you make that prospect not very
    likely. Their vicious jaws drool as they lick their chops and advance.
