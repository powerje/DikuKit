This big jolly egg of a fellow seems not to have a care in the
world.  Perhaps you should tell him that he seems to be slowly
slipping off of his perch.

Wicket~
{W}A White Wicket{w}~
{W}A white wicket stands here, just another tool of the game{w}
~

   You gaze upon a rather large wicket, standing
   vigilantly, albeit looking rather bored.  It gleams
   with a shine which rivals the sun itself. You jump
   back in surprise when it turns to look upon you. It
   only gives a blink, when it resumes it's perfectly
   still stance. It doesn't seem like it's going to harm
   anything, so it maybe a good idea to leave it alone.
   Besides, the Queen would be rather upset at you
   ruining a perfectly good game of croquette.

This burly fellow is suited up in a set of battle plate.  He brandishes

is about to bring his sword smashing down upon your skull.
