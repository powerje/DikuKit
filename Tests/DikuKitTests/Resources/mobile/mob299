   This great wizard studied in the finest universities of the
   realm of the crossroads.  He has become so smart that no one
   is able to understand him anymore.  He makes his living here
   selling potions to students of magic and the arts of war and
   dark practices.

  This high ranking officer knows why battles are won and

  Commander in Vietnam. He has ordered many men to their 
  deaths and would not even think twice about assigning you 
  the same fate. Good thing you didn't sign up with hopes of 
  survival.
