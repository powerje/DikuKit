snake~
A muddy water snake~
The muddy water snake rears its head as it lunges at you !!
~
  It is about 8-feet long and has a soft silky skin, probably because it is sliding around in its own filth all day.  It sticks its forked tongue out at you as it stares up at you with its black eyes.

You see your reflection in the water....

  You see see what appears a just a reflection in the water.  It doesn't seem harmful at first sight, but as you inspect it closer you see that it is indeed a powerful force of darkness.

{GR}Lucky, the Lucky {RE}C{BLU}h{YE}a{GR}r{BLU}m{WH}s{wh}{GR} Elf{gr}
~

   {CY}Lucky stands before you half the elf he used to be.  He has been worn down by
   the system and only knows one way to do things; his way.  Accused of murder
   and on the run from the authorities he has made it his final mission to make
   sure that his tasty marshmellow treats do not fall into the wrong hands.  He
   keeps peering over his shoulder wondering if anyone is following him.  He hands
   you a copy of his testimonial letter and shuffles away into the shadows.{cy}

Judge DREDD, in his stature and skill, represents the law of the future of
Midgaard. His reputation strikes fear to all those who oppose The LAW.
He looks just as scary as the comic!  In fact, since he's staring at you,
he's many more time more imposing!  EEEEeeeekkkk!!!!
In fact, he is the Judge, the Jury, and the Executioner.  You better not
mess with him since he looks like he can destory anyone with his bare
hands.
