Essence of Thress~
The {RED}Essence{red} of {BLUE}T{blue}h{BLUE}r{blue}e{BLUE}s{blue}s~
The damned soul of Thress haunts here....
~

 This being is made of shadow, a dark substance
 that seems in painful turmoil. Voices come from
 within, along with words of the past, horror and
 death. Almost weeping you stand tall, and prepare
 for combat. Soon you shall grant peace to this
 tortured ghost...again.
