chardath brother spellseer spulzeer~
{R}Chardath{r}~
{R}A rather unkept and disturbed man wanders about{r}
~

     Chardath bears the vague likeness of a weasel.  His 
     pointed nose, small mouth, and narrow, upturned chin all
     combine to create this resemblance.  His small, deep-set
     eyes, tangled, bushy brows, and scraggly goatee merely
     enhance his beastial image.

     Chardath has long, sandy-colored hair, which cascades
     over his jutting ears and flows down his collar to the
     center of his back.  His nails are long, chipped, and 
     scarred from years of abuse.  His sunken eyes permanently
     squint when he looks out on the world, for years of living
     in the dark places of the spirit will do that to a man.

     no sign of desiccation appearing as a newly
