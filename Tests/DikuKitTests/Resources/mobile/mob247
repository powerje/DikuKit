zelda princess hyrule~
{C}Princess {M}Zelda{m}~
Zelda, Princess of Hyrule, stands peering through a nearby window.
~

     Dressed in a lovely purple and white dress Zelda
     doesnt notice your presence as she peers into a
     nearby castle window.

     She seems very interested in whats going on inside
     the castle.

     Taking a look for yourself it seems Ganondorf, King
     of the Gerudo thieves, is inside speaking with the
     King of Hyrule.

     making him look kinda silly trying to see over the
     counter thats as tall as he is.  "Can i help ya?",
     he asks.

king zora~
{C}King {BLU}Zora{blu}~
King Zora sits atop a large throne here surrounded by several other Zora.
~

     King Zora is much larger than any of the other Zora
     youve seen.  He looks more like a large fish with
     arms and legs rather than having the more human
     characteristics of the other Zora.  He doesnt seem
     to be happy about your being here... Perhaps you
     should have brought a gift..
