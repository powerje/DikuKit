     A co-owner of a leading chemical manufacturer, Norman Osborn 
     was obsessed with power. He had great wealth and great power 
     already, but it was not enough. Norman came across notes 
     pertaining to a chemical formula made by his ex-partner, 
     Mendell Stromm. It was to increase a person's intellect 
     and physical strength. After experimenting with this formula, 
     Osborn had it turn green and explode near him. The after 
     effects not only gave him super-human powers but drove him 
     insane and quickly became Spider-Man's most deadly villain as 
     the Green Goblin!
