Terrorist~
The terrorist~
A terrorist runs around the compound placing explosives.

This Man looks like a highly skilled member of the military.  He

Several scars cover his face, and run down the length of his arm.  It is 
obvious that he has seen a good many battles.

sergeant packer~
Seargent Packer~
A sergeant stands here, keeping a watchful eye on his troops.
~
Tough and ugly, not much more to say about this guy.... 
His scars show his experience in battle. His glare shows his ability
to intimidate. His boots show his ability to deliver a good ass kicking.
Tread carefully on Seargent Packers turf because Seargent Packer wont tread
carefully on you.

Lord Kimbo~
A big red alien glares at you.
~
  Lord Kimbo stands over seven feet tall.  His large muscular frame easily
dwarfs yours.  He looks at you with his large yellow eyes, and begins to
explain to you how he was captured by UFO-oligests several weeks back.
He then proceeds to tell you about his home which is located deep in the
magma in the center of the earth.

fox moulder spooky~
Fox Moulder~
An Fbi Agent sits at his desk looking over old newspaper clippings.
~
You see one half of the Xfiles team, David Duchovny.  You look at him and
wonder why he and Scully have never gotten it on.  Perhaps it's because
of a secret that only he knows about.  Perhaps he is gay.  Or perhaps the 
writers just want to draw it out a little more.  Only time will tell.

scully~
Scully~
A female FBI agent is here looking over some reports.
~
Flowing waves of red hair come down across a stern, serious yet soft face.
She has been working with Fox Moulder for a while now trying to keep up
with his crazy instincts and his pushy style of solving cases.
Together the two of them have come so close to the truth so many times
but i guess if they ever did actually get there..... The series would have to end.

Cancerman~
A man wearing a dark suit sits at his desk smoking a cigarette.

An old trenchcoat and of course a smoke. This guy never stops smoking!
He always seems to appear at the oddest places and hand Fox the most
vital information. So far, Fox has been able to trust him. But
you never know in the dangerous world of lies and deceit and coverups
that Fox and Scully deal with every day... who will turn against you,
or when.

wondering what kind of problems Fox and Scully are out there causing.
This poor guy has to take the heat for his star agents and they just never
seem to stop with the flames. He sees you enter the room and a vein pops 
out in his forehead. Now you done it....
