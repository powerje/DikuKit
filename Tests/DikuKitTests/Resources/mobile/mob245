~
{W}
   The skeletal remains from some long dead miner lumbers towards you. 
When it sees you can sense a spark of what used to be its life ignite in
its eyes. Then however that spark turns to anger as the beast seems to 
remember what state it is in. It can no longer live so it will destroy
any reminders of life near it and unfortunately that means you!

{C}A man in robes wanders about the room with a concerned look on his face.{c}
~
{W}
   A man wanders around this room seemingly oblivious to all the danger 
around him. He is mumbling something to himself about the spell not being
permanent and that he has to figure another way to control them... You 
aren't sure what he is talking about but from the look on his face it
must be serious indeed.

{C}
   This is a big, venomous snake and it appears to be a little hungry.
You had better hope it isn't hungry enough to make a one course meal out
of you.

~
{W}
   This snake is massive. Twenty feet might be an understatement. It
appears to be rolling its massive bulk right towards you. If it can
just wrap its body around you and just squeeze you will be its meal for
the whole week.

{C}A man in robes made from scales stands an impassive vigil here.{c}
~
{W}
   This man looks like he has been here so long that you almost mistook
him for a statue. Looking at him though you have no doubt that he is 
alive. He wears a robe that looks to be made of snake scales and his face
bears almost serpentine features.

{C}A man with the head of a snake gives you what looks to be a smile.{c}
~
{W}
   With what can only be a smile, the shaman nods his head at you. You 
and he both know that it has come down to this. Do not underestimate him
however for the robe he wears fairly glows with power and the amulets 
and charms that you can see dangling from him look very powerful indeed.

~
 {C}
   This guy is massive. He looks as if he could put his entire
fist through the side of a mountain. Whatever did this to him
seems to have had the side effect of making him a very angry
individual. You had better be careful around him.

Venus Fly Trap~

{G}A large plant slowly wanders around snapping at the combatants.{g}
~
 {G}
   This is a very large version of what you know as the 
Venus Fly Trap. The only difference is that instead of 
going after bugs and small insects it is going after much 
larger prey like anything around it. It is also much quicker
than you would give a plant credit for...be wary.

 {B}
   A mean jungle cat with a voracious appetite, this creature
was placed in this arena for one purpose...create fear and
chaos in the minds of the opponents. You can understand why
as you see the thing grab hold of one combatant and rip its
arm off in one swift motion...

   This player is walking around with a helmet just like
the one that you have on. In fact it looks like he is going
to try and kill some of the creatures that you wanted to kill.
This guy is being a real jerk. He is trying to hog all the
action in here whether you like it or not. Perhaps you can
teach him that it isn't polite to do that (**Grin**).
