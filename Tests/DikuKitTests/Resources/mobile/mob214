   and cackles, running her bony fingers through her black hair.  
   It looks as though many creatures have begun to nest her stinky

   Freed of her enwrapping cloaks and shawls, Viviane, The Lady of
   the Lake, is a surprisingly little woman, no taller than a well-grown
   girl of eight or ten. In her loose tunic with its wrapped belt, a knife
   sheathed at her waist, and bulky woolen breeches, legs wrapped
   with thick leggings, she looked tiny, a child put into adult clothes.
   Her face is small, swarthy and triangular, the forehead low beneath
   hair dark as the shadows beneath the crags. Her eyes are dark, too,
   and large in her small face.


   Vivian, Lady of the Lake and of the Holy Isle, is at this time in her
   thirties, eldest daughter of the ancient priestess of the Lake, she
   has succeeded to her mother's office. Her knuckles whiten as she 
   holds something tightly in her hands.

   You have ventured to Camelot many times as of today,
   and this flubbering idiot is telling the same story. You wish he'd
   travel, so he would have something different to say.

   Oh the stories this old man has told.....and boy is he telling them!!
