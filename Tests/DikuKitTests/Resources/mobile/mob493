  well trained in the arts of thievery, more than a

Shade thief elder trainer master~
{BL,BO}Shade{bl,bo}~
A dark figure steps out from the shadows and begins to speak.
~
{BL,BO}
  Dressed in only a dusty rugged looking outfit this
  little dark elf does not appear to be much of a 
  threat. However, you grow somewhat concerned when 
  he holds out his hand presenting to you the ring 
  you had only moments ago been wearing on your finger.
  What? He has not moved since you entered the room! 
  Or has he?

{BLU,BO}A warrior stands drilling his trainees in the art of battle.{blu,bo}
~
{BLU,BO}
  This old warrior has lived through many great 
  battles. He trained under Kruik, the great 
  warrior. As you walk across the room the trainer 
  seems to follow you with his eyes, step for step. 
  He wears a suit of traditional gladiator equipment, 
  with a golden ring upon his finger. The ring begins
  to glow brightly as you stare at it, strange.

Abracadabra mage elder trainer master~
{M}Abracadabra{m}~
{M}A great mage strokes his beard knowingly.{m}
~
{BLU}
  A short, man with a long white beard and a pointed 
  silvery hat looks you over as you look him over. 
  His tunic, pants and hooded robe fit loosely about
  his slender body. His blue velvet sash holds it all
  together. The crystal on his staff catches your eye
  as the light hits it. You're mesmerized at his power.
