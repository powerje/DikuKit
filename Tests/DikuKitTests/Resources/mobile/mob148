A Janitor~
A lonely man with a broom in his hand is standing here.
~
 
      One man is responsible for keeping these halls clean, and
      before you is that man.  His never ending job keeps him
      here almost all hours of the day.  He must be very loyal
      or very stupid but as you think this he looks up at you and
      extends his left hand.  You look away from his hand only to
      notice a toothless smile.
