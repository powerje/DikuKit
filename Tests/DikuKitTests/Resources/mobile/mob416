{W}A {BO}{Y}Pesky{y} {BO}{B}Mosquito{b}~
{BO}{B}The most annoying of nature's insects buzzes in your ear{b}.
~

  Buzzing about your ear, these pesky little bugs though small
  in nature can pack a big punch if your not careful. You might
  try squashing one, it'll probably make you feel better about
  yourself.

~

  This has got to be the strangest bird ever.  He keeps on
  tripping over his own beak.  He keeps trying to look at
  the ground to see where he's going, but with such an 
  over-sized probiscus each time he looks down all that is
  accomplished is to bury the tip of it in the ground and
  vaulting the bird in to the air.

~

  A creature that shouldn't exist, except to a medical
  student with an overactive imagination.  The platypus
  exists in spite of nature, rather than as a result of
  natural selection.

  A mystical white horse with wings upon it's back. It gallops
  gracefully about  the garden with out a care in the  world.
  They dont seem to be very dangerous, though you may want to
  stay clear, just incase they do decide to attack .

~

  A man with a fish tail instead of legs.  In the pages of history
  there has only been one creature that has ever existed with this
  kind of anatomy.  This creature would be the mythical merman.
   
  This bronzed fellow is well muscled and it is plain that he spends
  much of his time in the sun or otherwise enhancing his physique.
  The mermaids seem to respond to his appearance with favor, so
  perhaps his time is well spent.

  A woman with a fish tail instead of legs.  In the pages of history
  there has only been one creature that has ever existed with this
  kind of anatomy.  This creature would be the mythical mermaid.
   
  As with all red headed females in history, this lady has fair skin,
  where she has skin.  Even the scales of her lower end have a red
  tint to them though.  Perhaps her temperment is softer than is the
  normal for less aqautic red haired beauties.

  A woman with a fish tail instead of legs.  In the pages of history
  there has only been one creature that has ever existed with this
  kind of anatomy.  This creature would be the mythical mermaid.
   
  Despite her fishy posterior, her beauty is beyond compare.  Her
  beautiful blond hair creates a halo around her face.  The light
  reflects from the soft locks enhancing her beauty, rather than
  detracting from it.

  This would appear to be  one of the mythical creatures created

  an example of the finest equine possible.  The fur that adorns
  it's body seems to be finer than silk. The horn though, really
  is something to behold,  for it seems to give  off a light all 
  of it's own.
