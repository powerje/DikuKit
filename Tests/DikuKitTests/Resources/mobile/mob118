     Born 5000 years ago in Egypt, Apocalypse is the oldest mutant in the world, an
     immortal who has seen almost the whole of human history unfold. Born with
     apparent deformities on his face, he was abandoned by his tribe, but saved from
     death by Baal, leader of the Sandstormers, a group of bandits.

  {BOLD,MAG}
     These fanatical followers of Magneto look to him as their savior. They believe 
     that mutants should rule the flatscans (humans) and have no compuctions about 
     killing, although not all of them are totally convinced of the righteousness of
     their cause.
