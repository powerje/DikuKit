A Popular Girl~
A cute girl is having all the men fawn all over her.
~
Hey, this girl's pretty hot. All the men that are here at the prom
want a chance to dance with her. Too bad she only hangs out with the cool 
kids.

dancer dancing fool~
A Disco-Dancing Fool~
Some reject from Saturday Night Fever is on the dance floor
~
This guy kind of looks like an extra from one of those late 70s movies
about Disco. He's trying to do the Hustle, but he can't dance at all. Someone
get him off the stage!

{BOLD}{YELLOW}Sailor Moon{bold}{yellow}~
Princess Serenity is here, a captive of the Negaverse.
~
This young girl is supposedly the legendary Moon Princess. She sure
doesn't act like one. She seems to cry a lot, and doesn't really
seem determined to be a real hero.

{BOLD}{GREEN}Sailor Jupiter{bold}{green}~
Lita is here, playing the Sailor V video game.
~
For a tomboy she looks kinda cute. If you try and pinch her butt she might
kick your ass though. I really wouldn't try to play with her at all.

An intelligent girl named Amy is here sizing you up for battle.

This smart young woman is not too strong, but she is very smart, and is
a valuable asset to the Sailor Scouts.

{BOLD}{RED}Sailor Mars{bold}{red}~
The one known as Raye is here, playing with fire.
~
This girl is rather hot, and I mean literally. She can use strong fire magic,
so you'd better watch where you put your hands.

be useful for the big screen... Oh yea, she looks pretty strong, too.

Tuxedo Mask~
A man in a tuxedo and cape is looking for the Silver Imperium Crystal.
~
Hey! This guy is wearing a tuxedo and a top hat to battle! I 
wouldn't laugh at him if I were you. Even though his weapon of
choice is a rose, he seems rather difficult to defeat.

{BOLD}{MAGENTA}Velius, the Zodiac Monster of Aries{magenta}{bold}~
A giant ram like creature representing the Zodiac Braves is here
~
At one time this rather nasty looking fellow was human. Unfortunately
he saw the power of the Zodiac stones and unlocked the Aeris one, turning
him into a rather powerful ram.
