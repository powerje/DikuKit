You notice a very long, very thick, snake here.

The Anaconda can not rely on speed for its 
attack, so he depends on brute strength, which 
he has plenty of.  As he slithers along, you cant 
help but to picture yourself wound up in those 
muscular coils while every ounce of your life is 
squeezed out of you.

You can just barely make out this little mouse 
in the tall grass.  The only thing that gives it away 
is his glowing aura.  You have had experiences 
with animals that have this glow, this almost always 
means that they are rabid.  You d better watch you 
step, if there is one rabid mouse around, there will be 
others as well.

This is one of the many patients you have seen wandering 
around this area.  Since this is a small town, there are no 
hospital rooms per se, and patients are identified by the 
blue hospital robes that they wear.  Thus, Doctors and 
Nurses spend most of their time chasing down patients 
who think they are well enough to leave but usually on get 
so far as to make it difficult on the Doctors and Nurses in 
getting them back.

you be?  They also get very upset when you interrupt 
the doctors and nurses as they hope that the next 
patient they get to will be the one they are waiting for.
