Standing here doing cartwheels is The Great Liz Agnia!

The Great Ravioli~
The Great Ravioli~
There is a man here trying to bend himself into a square. How Odd.
~
Standing before you is a man who seems to take his name very seriously. He
appears to be attempting to make himself into a perfect square so as to
resemble a ravioli! How odd, you wonder why one would attempt such a futile
task, and also how he would taste in Primer's maranara sauce.

The Great Linguini~
A stringy looking fellow practices flipping in circles in front of you.
~
This tall wirey figure would seem the perfect trapeze artist if it were
not for one small flaw... He is so thin that you cant see how anybody could
get a good grip on anything but this guys head!

The Great Pasta Fazule~
There is a really mad man mumbling something about last names ending in I's.
~
Well it seems this guy is really mad about the fact that his name does end
with the letter 'I' like all the other Great performers of the trapeze group
and it also seems his hatred of the others has mad him VERY strong.
