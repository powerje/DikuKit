   The HerdLord is a stern-faced man of middle years: bald, save for
   a silvering of cropped hair at the back of his head. His gaze is
   proud and uncompromising like a keen-eyed hawk. He has held his
   years well, his belly flat. His body muscular as it had been in his
   youth, when he first won the leadership of the Xandim by Right of
   Challenge. Phalias was his name, and he was Chief and HerdLord
   of the Xandim.

   Not a man's length away from the stones were two of the ghosts -
   not spectral beings at all, you discover, but great cats of an
   awesome size.

   You swallow hard, seeing the size of their claws, like scimitars of
   steel, and their great white fangs as they snarled in a low and
   menacing duet. The gleaming pelt of one was stark black against
   the snow, the other was black with patterned dapples of gold.

   The blazing lamps of their watchful yellow eyes filled with a weird
   and arcane intelligence. Your breath freezes in your throat.

{BO,G}
   You glance down into the waters, swearing you had
   seen something swimming beneath you. The water was
   not very clear due to the weed, so you dismiss the
   eery feeling. The water around starts to become
   very disturbed, as you look down, there about a
   metre below you is the outline of a large dolphin.
   A mage in your group informs you, that these are
   kind, intelligent sea creatures sent by Aurian to
   guide you through these unchartered waters.
