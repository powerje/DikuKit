He is a priest of Lord Soth. He walks these halls reciting ancient poems
of harm and hate. He wears all black, and has never seen the light of the
natural sun. His snow white face is hung low, never looking before him...

ramen manethrall lithe~
Manethrall Lithe, Guardian of the Ranyhyn~
A strange looking woman stands solidly in your path.
~


She is slim and slight, dressed in a deep brown shift that leaves her arms and
legs free. Her skin is sundarkened to the color of earth. Her long black hair
flows freely about her shoulders. Depite her smallness, she stands prepared to
defend the Ranyhyn she so worships.

saltheart foamfollower giant~
A Giant of Seareach~
Saltheart Foamfollower greets you with a mighty chuckle.
~


A short beard, as stiff as iron juts from his face. His eyes 
are small, deep-set and enthusiastic. From under his brows, 
massed over his sockets like the wall of a fortress, his 
glances flashed piercingly, like gleams from his cavernous 
thoughts. He appears congenial and of good humor.

A wraith of Andelain~
A wraith dances at the Celebration of Spring.
~


A flame like the burn of candle---tiny in the distance, and yet vivid,
swaying yellow and orange as clearly as if you held the candle in your 
hands yourself. It dances with joy and glee at the thought of Spring.

Lord Shetra~
Lord Shetra scoffs at the intrusion of your presence.
~


This female Lord of Revelstone has stiff iron-grey hair and a face like
a hawk--keen of nose and eye, lean of cheek. Her eyes hold a sharp gleam
like the hunting stare of a falcon.

Lord Hyrim~
Lord Hyrim regards you with a look of appraisal.

glances toward you.

The Loremaster~
An ur-vile loremaster slavers from its gaping nostrils.

Mucus trails from its nostrils back along either side of its head. Dark,
roynish, and cruel, its eyeless face is filled with an evil scowl.

Jehannum, the Giant Raver~
A giant jeers at you with a malevolent grin.
~
He appears as a giant of the Land, but somehow different. He stinks of fresh
blood---spattered with it from head to foot. Within him, clinging to his
bones is a powerful presence that does not fit his form. He slavers from 
behind his eyes with a great force of malice and wrong.

First Mark Tuvor, the Bloodguard~
A Bloodguard stands impassively before you.
~


You see a flat, unreadable face that shows no signs of youth or age, as
if his relationship with time is somehow ambivalent. He conveys such an
impression of solidity that it distracts you. He nods slightly toward you.
