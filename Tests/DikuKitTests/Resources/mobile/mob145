{BLUE,BOLD}A Rotting Zombie{blue,bold}~
A pale skinned creature scurries about.
~

His skin is a pale grey color. As he walks closer you notice that huge pieces of
flesh randomly fall off his frail body. He stinks of decay, and the sight of
him makes you ill.

{YELLOW,BOLD}Esmirelda{yellow,bold}~
A woman stands stirring up a brew.
~

{GREEN,BOLD}Age has made this once beautiful woman decrepit, but her wisdom
has given her the strength to remain on this plain of existance.
Her long purple robe flutters in the breeze, as she looks dreamily
at the sky. She grabs clumsily a scroll, her gnarled hands 
creaking and cracking. She whips around and glares at you,
her once violet eyes, now cataraxed and milky white.
She howls and curses as she hobbles towards you, you feel her
long crooked nails dig deep into your cheek.{green,bold}
