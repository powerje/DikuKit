{BLUE}A powerful looking humanoid cloaked in full cyber armor looms above you
~
{BLUE}
You have never seen a being such as this !  A huge figure dressed entirely in 
angular bio-armor.  It is edgy, yet flowing with grace and power.
As you stand here two jets of steam pulse from exhaust manifolds in the
face mask.  With a great metallic hum the unit comes to life.  The power
metal in the forhead shines brightly and you are sure that your 
death in near !

   When you look at Ken you can't help but want to
   reach out and touch his scultped plastic chest.
   He has a neutered groin area, which makes you kind of wonder about him...
   His permanent flesh coloured briefs are a little odd too...
   You have to admit he is the most flat-footed male you have ever seen!
   But, he is just so adorable, and he is Barbie's Dream.

   Bruno Staller is frantically trying to type into a small computer 
here. He wears some kind of uniform with the word Zoa crossed off with
an X on the sleeve. He appears to have been hurt recently as you can
see a small pool of blood at his feet. Whatever he is typing must be
very important to have him ignore that kind of wound.

   This beast looks like something out of a nightmare. It is amazing that
it can fit down here. It stands about 5 feet tall at the shoulder and you
can see small wisps of flame when it breaths. It appears to be sniffing 
the air for some kind of scent. You wonder what on earth something like 
this can be searching for. You are just glad that it is too busy searching
to notice the fact that you just entered the tunnel with it.

   out an an unwary victim.

   He eyes you warily as the receptionist asks you for your name and who

   This creature stands only about 6-1/2 feet tall. What it seems to lack
in size (compared to its friends), it more than makes up for in power.
It has two large pods sitting on its shoulders. You can see them opening
up and absorbing particles from the air around them. They look like they
are some sort of energy weapon. Your hope that you are mistaken.

   This is a massive apelike creature standing about 7 feet tall. It looks
as though someone crossbred a bat with a giant ape because this thing has
beady little bat eyes and large sonar grabbing ears, but it also has the 
massively muscular frame of a giant gorilla. There is no doubt in your mind
that he is just as formidable as all the other creatures you have seen.

{RED}A mansized creature is here utterly destroying everything in its way

   This creature appears to be a man encased in some sort of full body armor.
Although he doesn't look too tough, his actions speak louder than words. He 
is easily hacking through all these Zoanoids and doesn't appear to be 
breaking a sweat. Upon closer inspection the suit looks very impressive. It 
has what can only be described as an antenna on the top of its head along
with what appears to be extra eyes that run on some kind of track along the 
top (For excellent peripheral vision perhaps...). The suit also has nasty 
looking vibrating spikes attached to its elbows which you have seen cut one 
of these creatures in half. Whatever form of creature this is, you can tell
that it shouldn't be underestimated...
