mosquito~
buzzing mosquito~
The most annoying of nature's insects buzzes in your ear.
~
 
    According to an ancient legend, the mosquito buzzes in the ears of
    all animals begging forgiveness for an ancient sin.  It would seem
    that the mosquito, once upon a time, had cried wolf and inadvertently
    caused the death of a child.  Now, he buzzes in ears and begs to
    be forgiven for his sins.  The usual answer is to swat it dead.

{bo,G}This {R,BL}D{BLU}o{R}D{BLU}o {R}B{BLU}i{R}R{BLU}d {bo,G}seems to keep tripping over it's own beak.
~
 
     This has got to be the strangest bird ever.  He keeps on
     tripping over his own beak.  He keeps trying to look at
     the ground to see where he's going, but with such an 
     over-sized probiscus each time he looks down all that is
     accomplished is to bury the tip of it in the ground and
     vaulting the bird in to the air.

platypus~
duck-billed platypus~
What do you get when you cross a duck and a beaver?
~
 
 
     A creature that shouldn't exist, except to a medical
     student with an overactive imagination.  The platypus
     exists in spite of nature, rather than as a result of
     natural selection.

penguin~
{BLA,BO}Pe{WH}ng{BLA}uin{bla}~
The tuxedoed bird of the south seems to be enjoying the warm sun.
~
 
    Though normally restricted to colder climates, this penguin and
    his friends seem to be enjoying their time here in the sun and
    milder weather.  Perhaps it is a misconception that these not so
    gentle creatures must live in the cold.

mermaid blond~
a blond mermaid~
{C}A {Y,BO}blond {G}mermaid {bo,C}floats on the surface of the pond, sunning herself.
~
 
     A woman with a fish tail instead of legs.  In the pages of history
     there has only been one creature that has ever existed with this
     kind of anatomy.  This creature would be the mythical mermaid.
 
     Despite her fishy posterior, her beauty is beyond compare.  Her
     beautiful blond hair creates a halo around her face.  The light
     reflects from the soft locks enhancing her beauty, rather than
     detracting from it.

{bo,C}A {RE,BO}red haired {G}mermaid {bo,C}searches the bottom of the pond for pretty baubles.
~
 
     A woman with a fish tail instead of legs.  In the pages of history
     there has only been one creature that has ever existed with this
     kind of anatomy.  This creature would be the mythical mermaid.
 
     As with all red headed females in history, this lady has fair skin,
     where she has skin.  Even the scales of her lower end have a red
     tint to them though.  Perhaps her temperment is softer than is the
     normal for less aqautic red haired beauties.

a buff merman~
{bo,C}A {Y}bald {GR,BO}merman {bo,C}watches carefully over his harem.
~
 
     A man with a fish tail instead of legs.  In the pages of history
     there has only been one creature that has ever existed with this
     kind of anatomy.  This creature would be the mythical merman.
 
     This bronzed fellow is well muscled and it is plain that he spends
     much of his time in the sun or otherwise enhancing his physique.
     The mermaids seem to respond to his appearance with favor, so
     perhaps his time is well spent.

A flying rodent seems confused by your presence.

       Most worms make good bait to fish with, but this one
       begs the question of who is higher on food chain, the
       fish or the worm?  It would be best to keep any loose
       items of clothing away from the jaws of this strange
       beast.

~
 
     This cat seems more prehistoric than any others hunting
     in the lands of Northern Crossroads.  It's doubtful if
     there are any of these anyplace else in the world. It's
     even more doubtful if this creature isn't an anachronism
     and belongs in the history books.

     A creature that is half man, half bear and half pig would
     at first glance seem impossible. The one that stands here
     would show just how possible such a creation truly is. As
     if it's looks weren't  bad enough, but the stench rolling
     off this creature gives further proof of it's existance.

    This would appear to be  one of the mythical creatures created
    by some ancient gods, known as Unicorn.  It would appear to be
    an example of the finest equine possible.  The fur that adorns
    it's body seems to be finer than silk. The horn though, really
    is something to behold,  for it seems to give  off a light all 
    of it's own.

~
{WH,BO}
 
        The progenitor of all the of the winged serpent
        stories told throughout history, simply lays
        about absorbing the rays of the sun.  His mission
        is not about death and destruction, but rather
        procreation.  This creature, whose width is more
        than the leg of a giant and whose length is more
        than enough to stretch from gate to gate back in
        Midgaard, has the same goals of any fathers: to
        see to it that his offspring get to grow up and
        be healthy.
