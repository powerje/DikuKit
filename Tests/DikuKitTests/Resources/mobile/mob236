A disheveled man stands here examining oraganisms.

     Before you stands a disheveled man. 
He examines biological specimens that have
been collected from the sea. As you look at
him closely you see a sea-sickness patch 
behind his ear. He looks like he has been 
sick and doesn't want to be on the boat 
anymore. He is very intent on studying the 
specimens before him.
