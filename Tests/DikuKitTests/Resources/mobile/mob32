The Ice Dragon~
The Ice Dragon lunges at you as you enter.

   This dragon looks just like the fairytale dragons of old, but it seems to
be made entirely of ice.  You can barely see the wall of the chamber through
its almost transparent wings.  It stretches to its full height of fifteen
stories and a plume of frost jets out of one nostril.  Icicles hang off its
body in almost every place there is a joint.
