seoman snowlock king~
{BLU}Seoman {W}Snow{BLU}lock~
{BLU}Seoman {W}Snow{BLU}lock{blu}, King of {BO,W}O{C}s{W}t{C}e{W}n{C} A{W}r{C}d{bo,w}, gracefully commands your attention.
~
As you look at King {BLU}Seoman{blu}, you can't help but stare.  He appears to be a young man, maybe in his early twenties, but his presence is overpowering, as if he is wise beyond a thousands lifetimes.  You can't help but feel as though this young King has been through many adventures you could never imagine poosible, and from the stories you hear it is quite possibly true!  He appears quite imposing and god-like, yet you feel like you could talk to him about anything, almost like he were your best friend and always has been.  He sees you staring at him and a warm smile spreads across his face, as if he were saying "Thank you, I am glad you came!"

Binabik~
Binabik~
Standing before you is a short little troll, with a cheery look on his face
~
Here is the infamous Binabik, troll friend of the King, in the living flesh.  You have never seen a troll before because they seldom, in fact almost never, leave their homes on the snow-topped mountains of Yiquanuc, so his appearance surprises you.  He is dwarfish, about four feet in height, with ruddy skin from life in the frigid mountains.  His face seems to be frozen in a cheery smile and his great gray wolf never leaves his side.  As you look him up and down, he speaks!  "Please to meet you, I am Binbiniqegabenik, but you may call me Binabik!  I have been sent here to help you on your way!"

Josua Lackhand~
Josua "Lackhand"~
Prince Josua, younger son of Prester John, Lord of Naglimund
~
Josua looks you up and down, trying to see whether or not you have the courage and honour it takes to be a Kings {Y}Champion{y}.  Josua is known to be one of the most honourable men in all {W}O{C}s{W}t{C}e{W}n{C} A{W}r{C}d{w}, which he proved after helping rid the land of the tainted evil of his brother Elias, the former king of {W}O{C}s{W}t{C}e{W}n{C} A{W}r{C}d{w}.  Josua, having given up his right to the throne in favor of {BLU}Seoman{blu}, retains his lordship over Naglimund and is a faithful friend and advisor to the new King.  So you can trust that he will admit only the bravest and most honourable men or women into the Kings elite forces.

Morgenes~
Dr. Morgenes~
If you seek intelligence you have come to the right man, Doctor Morgenes
~
This man was once mentor and teacher to {BLU}Seoman{blu}, now King of {W}O{C}s{W}t{C}e{W}n{C} A{W}r{C}d{w}.  These two are as father and son, creating an equal and loving relationship.  Morgenes is also the most renowned scientific mind in all the world, and knows much about the arcane and magical.  He is a kind, gentle man but rest assured he has power enough to defend himself and his beloved home, {BLU}Asu'a{blu}.

Wolf~
Great Grey Wolf~
The great wolf, eyes you with a wary glance, ready to protect his friend
~
Here stands a wild looking Grey wolf who looks about ready to rip your throat out in a single bite if you so much as look at the troll, Binabik, in a slightly unfriendly way.  You know that Binabik has almost complete control over the wolf, and even considers him a friend, but do you really want to test it?  No, didn't think so, so just relax and do what it is you came here to do and you will survive this experience, with your throat intact.

Here is another of those smelly big guys, except this one is lazy as well.  The man is laying unconcious on the ground reeking completely of alcohol.  So much for guard duty!  Just make it quick and quiet!

You can see for yourself that this ...thing, wants to tear you to shreds!  Its sharp tusks are looking anxious to impale you and its clawed feet are ready to scratch out your eyes.  He snorts and flames come dancing towards your face, looks like you may regret this choice after all!
