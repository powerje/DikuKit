{Y}Max stands here shaking in fear.{y}

{Y}
  Poor little fellow, he lives with the
  meanest, most heartless creature to ever
  live. This tender, loving dog has been
  subjected to the cruelties of the Grinch.
  Yet, his big, brown eyes look out over 
  Who-ville with hope that one day...
  *sigh* it will never be...
  He's stuck here with the Grinch.
