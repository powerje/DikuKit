zoharns bloody head~
You see before you a {RED}bloody{red} head of a once very respectable individual.
Lord Zoharn refused to take part in any Christmas rituals and vowed to defeat Santa.
Despite as powerful as Zoharn may have been, he was no match for the mighty
Santa Clause.  The battle was fierce but with a  flash of his candy cane,
Santa decapitated poor lil' Zoharn =(

  Dragonscale uses two precise sizes of rings, the smaller
rings fit exactly inside the larger ones. Layering these
rings creates a look similar to animal scales. Dragonscale 
is flexible and particularly pleasing to the touch. This
bracelet is unique in the sense that actual dragon scales
have been woven together with the metal wire. It will both
enhance its protection and strengthen your might making
this a fine bracelet for battle.

Dragons, as most of you might know, come in a large array of 
sizes and colors, some even possess great powers such as the 
ability to breath fire,  gas, ice or a  variety   of   other
gaseous clouds at their victim.  However, in the case of the
Golden Dragon,  it's Fist was its biggest asset.  The dragon 
itself was small in size,   however,   one of it's four feet
were abnormally large.  At least  ten times larger  than the
rest of it's limbs, the Golden Dragon would  swoop down upon 
it's prey and either  crush  or  smash  them to   death   at
lightning fast speeds.  Very few of these "Fists", as Humans
referred to them, have been formed into  working   condition
for an individuals' arm, but you seem to be in  luck,   this
Fist fits perfectly around your arm.

  These are Soujiros battle boots.  If someone else has them, he probably

  to customize this piece for him, not you.  Anyway, since this is Soujiros
  piece only he has the power to wear them, if anyone else does, they will
  be cursed and hellfire will consume them or something.  Maybe not..
