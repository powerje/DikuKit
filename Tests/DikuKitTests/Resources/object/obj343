You stand in the middle of the battle field. To your north stand the
Army of (HELL). Amongst the frontline of the ranks stand HELL's Elite,
The Brothers of Destruction, led by General Bielnack. Jaskin, Quinn,
and Bielnack stand bravely fighting the small band of FMers and JKers
who thought that they could penetrate (HELL)'s headquarters. You
shudder as you see the blade of Quinn pierce the heart of a certain
JK Assassin (That relies upon his Sword of Souls for PKing). 

After the battle the Brothers stand atop a mountain of
JK and FM corpses. With the decapitated heads of their enemies held high
the Brothers smile in VICTORY!

{YEL}   Alright.  Chances are you have  your entire zone already planned
   out in your head. It's going to be a couple hundred rooms. There
   is going to be  a lot of tough  mobs protecting some pretty good 
   equipment. And it will take a  group of seven or eight people to
   complete the zone.  But just wait one moment!  What about all of
   those newbies and duals who  already have a severe lack of zones
   out there to complete?{yel}

   {CYA}Welcome to the ranks of all the immortals that have
   contributed, in some fashion, to bettering {BO,RE}Northern
   Crossroads{bo,re}{CYA}.  You're primary duty  as a new immortal
   is to create your very own original zone. You don't
   know how to create yet? Perfect!  That is just what 
   this guide will teach you to do. 


   {BO,CYA}This guide is only the beginning of the things that
   you will learn when  it comes to zone creation.  If 
   you don't apply yourself  to learning anything else 
   beyond what this  will teach you,  then you will be 
   doomed to the rank of Wizard for eternity. {bo,cya}

intro2~

   {CY}When  you  first  become  an immortal and you begin to
   create your first  zone,  it's very  tempting to  make 
   mobs  and  objects  equivalent  to  Melnibone,  Narnia, 
   and  even  Robotics Factory. However, what many people
   fail to realize is that if  everybody  goes  ahead and 
   makes zones  such  as these, then the types  of  zones 
   available  to  mortals  will  become  unbalanced.  The
   last thing that  we need here  is  fifty  new  Silicon 
   Nightmares  with  just  a  different theme.  What  I'm 
   basically trying to say, is to keep in mind that there 
   is also a need for newbie,  dual, and low-mid advanced 
   zones.  And it will be more  impressive  to see a well-
   built zone  of thise  type than  it will be to see 100 
   rooms with  100k  mobs and 20d10 wields.  You  get the 
   picture..{cy}
