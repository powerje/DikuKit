 {Y}{BOLD} A pattern of assorted animals and figurines are intricately carved into
  this wooden key.  The key seems to have been made long ago from a tree 
  that no longer grows.  You have seen this type of material in history
  books and ancient encyclopedias regarding how indestructible this 
  wooden material is.  You scratch your head curiously, pondering what 
  these unique etchings could mean.  As you proceed to place the key 
  into your pack, the key begins to glow brightly and gives off a low
  humming noise.  You close your eyes to protect them from the intense 
  light.  With your eyes closed, you slowly drift into a daze as a loud
  voice is heard within your mind, uttering one unforgettable phrase...{y}{bold}

 {G}{BOLD}Almost all of the crocodile's teeth stay on the outside of the mouth when
 closed. The upper and lower teeth showing makes them look like they are
 smiling. Crocodilians are built to grab and tear their food. All 
 crocodiles have at least 60 teeth which help them catch their prey. They
 may have as many as 3,000 teeth in the course of a lifetime.  Baby  
 crocodiles are born with an egg tooth that falls off soon after 
 hatching.  It seems someone has managed to find one of these teeth, sharpen
 it and use it as a ring.  The sharp edges the craftsmen created make
 this an ideal ring for combat.{g}{bold}

  claws are visible.  The claws are those of the legendary Aquil G'dal,
  the quickest animal in the Land.  The Aquil have a natural steroid in 
  their blood which allows them to react at a MUCH faster than normal 
  speed.  The Aucans have captured these beasts and came up with a system
  of filling the cape up with sacs of blood which are perfectly
  proportioned to evenly distribute the weight of the blood.  A small
  tube extends from the sac to the claw, each claw is then directly
  inserted into the body attaching to the wearer and injecting a small
  amount of Aquil blood when the claw is pressed in the center.  {w}{bold}

been etched into it along with the picture of a waterfall below it and beside the
two pictures is a compass with North facing up and South facing down.  Below all of
the pictures is carved in small writing "The clover is south of the water,"

Odd... What significance could this pose in your quest ?

  {Y}Leather armor was mostly worn for protection purpose and not seen on the 
  civilian population. This type of armor is great because it doesn't 
  restrict movement and it was the choice for many lightly armed troops 
  such as scouts or bowmen that rarely got hand-to-hand combat{y}

You lift up the visor of the shiny helmet and notice that it has some weird etchings
under it.  You grab a nearby torch and curiously try to decipher it.  After handing
the helmet back and forth between you and your partner you gather that the word is
in ancient Aucanian.  You shake your head sadly and admit to not knowing the Aucan
language and set the helmet down.  Your partner cackles insanely, picks the helmet 
up and exclaims, "You happen to be in luck because I happen to have taken interest
in Aucan history.  The word is : " alittleluckgoesalongway" .

ring glory enlightened~


  {Y}{BOLD}Its round shape makes the ring a paradigm of perfection and 
  eternity. The ring had hidden protective powers since a ring 
  closing around the finger created a magic force that warded off
  evil spirits. Wedding rings began to be worn on the ring finger 
  of the left hand because it was believed this finger was linked 
  to the heart. Wedding rings were placed on the ring finger so that 
  the feelings of the heart would be unable to escape. Gold wedding
  and engagement rings retain their splendour symbolising eternal
  happiness.{y}
