fountain sparkling electric Jolt~
The fountain gives you a strange exhilerating sensation. Small bolts
of electricity zap off the surface of this strange liquid. There is
a statue in the middle of the fountain that closely resembles your
very own, Loco! He is standing there with a silly grin on his face.
You suddenly notice he has started peeing into your liquid container!
ACK! Tphtt!
