{BO}{R}   
   The {Y}I{R}nner {G}C{R}ircle is a highly secretive clan born from the fittest members
   of the Guild of {BO}{B}Assassins{R}.  Until recently, this guild was only fabled to
   exist.  Citizens travelling through the western {bo}{G}forests{BO}{R} who claimed that
   they saw persons with the dreaded {BLU}<{R}T{Y}I{G}C{BLU}>{R} emblem tattooed on their neck have
   always mysteriously {BO}{B}died{R} in unexplainable accidental {Y}fires{R}, {C}drownings{R}, or
   {BO}{B}suicides{R}.  All fear their existence though rumours have it that they are
   {BO}{B}assassins{R} for hire.  Nothing more is known, but corpses of suspected members
   of T{Y}I{G}C{R} are sometimes found with their necks {bo}{Y}skinned{BO}{R} - a strong indication
   of a strict and disciplined internal law and punishment of this fabled
   organization.

  The Genealogy of the Rhodes Clan
 
  MGC traveled with the mighty Jaguar to the realm known as The
  Northern Crossroads. When Jaguar returned to his own lands,
  MGC decided to stay. He had fallen in love with a lass of
  uncommon beauty named Lyndaius. They had many children who
  became mighty warriors in their own rights: Wrestler, Jaws,
  Smash, Guard, Damage, Goldberg, Viking, and Progenitor, whose
  offspring settled in a sanctuary named The Inner Circle.
  Progenitor's sons and daughters were named Atlas, Thor,
  Yendor, Gault, Tylendal, Spear, Ancient, Grendal, Taipan,
  Darksky, Answer, Ragnark, Kronic, Mendi, Watcher, Seeker,
  Invictus, Foulsbane, Fortune, Tinker, Sparhawk, Cure, Extra,

  Nchanted, Deadend, Adrow, Peril, Toric, Blight, Arithon, Ring,
  Exile, Exiled, Busted, Undaunted, System, Foreign, Nitro, and
  Trainer. There a few other bastards out there he has not
  claimed yet.

  The large pool table is regulation size.  The workmanship put into this
table is quite remarkable.  The shiney brass pockets collect, and reflect
light into your eyes.  You suspect that whoever was using the table last
never quite finished the game, since several balls, and two
pool cues still lie on the green felt of the table.
