spoon of the gods~

   Long ago the Gods made magical items to give to the mortals that praised 
and pleased them. But before that task could be accomplished an Evil Lord
stole those itiems for himself to have these treasures and the power they
wielded. Searching the world the Gods finally found this Evil Lord and a
Battle was fought. The Evil Lord was destoryed and the treasures were all
scattered throughout the lands. Creatures found these treasures and kept
them for themselves.

   There are 35 of these items, 5 sets of seven. It is rumored that a reward
will be given for each set of 7 offered to te gods. These items can be hunted
traded or bought to complete a set. Only the first 5 set will be accepted.

   Even the Gods don't know the location of all these treasures. Your task is
set. Good Luck....
