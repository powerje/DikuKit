    Bayushi Shoju-sama,

    I have completed my search of the caves revealed after
  the earthquake.  I have seen a chamber with scrolls of
  ancient secrets, and a blade too dark to mention its
  name...  They appear to be guarded by the undead shells
  of bushi who had perished searching the cave long ago.

    I would suggest bringing a large escort if you
  continue to insist on searching those damned halls.

    Your loyal servant,
