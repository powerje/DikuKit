{BOLD}{BLACK}Brought to you by: {bold}{RED}Asbestos{bold}
{BOLD}{BLACK}Special thanks to reviewers:{bold} {BOLD}{WHITE}Mute, Giogia, Helsing, Zoharn{bold}

{BOLD}{WHITE}  {bold} 
{BOLD}{WHITE}  {BOLD}{BLACK}This is a leveling and eq zone for Advanced Players.{bold}
{BOLD}{BLACK}  {bold}
{BOLD}{BLACK}  Ideas of this zone are based off of the civilization of Tiwanaku in{bold}
{BOLD}{BLACK}  South America. In no way is this supposed to be a true representation{bold}
{BOLD}{BLACK}  of Tiwanaku.{bold}
{BOLD}{BLACK} {bold}
{BOLD}{BLACK}  To read the fictional background type: {BOLD}{BLUE}LOOK BACKGROUND{bold}

background~
    
{BOLD}{BLACK}   For centuries, Tiwanaku was believed to be folk lore, stories of{bold}
{BOLD}{BLACK}   natives possessing nearly supernatural strength. The men live along{bold}
{BOLD}{BLACK}   the shores of a lake called Titicaca, and the woman live in a city{bold}
{BOLD}{BLACK}   built atop a mountain overlooking the lake. The two groups are{bold}
{BOLD}{BLACK}   separated by a trail guarded by spirits, which only allow the{bold}
{BOLD}{BLACK}   strongest of the males to ascend the trail and mate. If a male lives{bold}
{BOLD}{BLACK}   to reach the top, he would be raped by the woman for a few weeks{bold}
{BOLD}{BLACK}   before sacrificed to the Fertility God. This ensured only the{bold}
{BOLD}{BLACK}   strongest and bravest offspring. Until now, Lake Titicaca and the{bold}
{BOLD}{BLACK}   city of Tiwanaku have been believed to be just tales. But explorers{bold}
{BOLD}{BLACK}   have discovered a group of extraordinarily strong men living on the{bold}
{BOLD}{BLACK}   shores of a relatively unknown lake. No women live amongst these men,{bold}
{BOLD}{BLACK}   but smoke rises from what is believed to be a village sitting on top{bold}
{BOLD}{BLACK}   of a nearby mountain. Could this be the Lost City of Tiwanaku?{bold}

{BOLD}{BLACK} {bold}{YELLOW} This male idol has been{BOLD}{BLACK} {bold}{CYAN}carved{BOLD}{BLACK} out of sandstone and stands about 5 feet{bold}
{BOLD}{BLACK}  {bold}{YELLOW}high. It is nearly recta{bold}{CYAN}ngular{BOLD}{BLACK} in shape, standing upright, with only{bold}
{bold}{YELLOW}  the outlines of body features{bold}{CYAN} carved{BOLD}{BLACK} in its sides. The only thing{bold}
{BOLD}{BLACK}  {bold}{YELLOW}protruding appears to be i{bold}{CYAN}ts geni{BOLD}{BLACK}tals. Oddly, both statue, and its{bold}
{BOLD}{BLACK}  {bold}{YELLOW}"parts" are pointing east t{bold}{CYAN}owards{BOLD}{BLACK} the vegetated cliff.{bold}

hut~
   
{bold}{GREEN}  This bamboo hut is large enough to sleep two or three natives. An{bold}
{bold}{GREEN}  animal skin hangs as a door, which is currently pulled aside allowing{bold}
{bold}{GREEN}  you to see the inside. {BOLD}{BLACK}Nothing of value seems to be located inside,{bold}
{BOLD}{BLACK}  just a few sleeping mats and tools. An unfriendly looking clay mask{bold}
{BOLD}{BLACK}  hangs on the outside wall, next to the door.{bold}

{bold}{CYAN}  A very plain looking fishing boat rests here. It is large enough to{bold}
{bold}{CYAN}  hold about three natives, their gear, and their catch. While this boat{bold}
{bold}{CYAN}  has been pulled ashore, {BOLD}{BLACK}the underside is wet, suggesting it had not{bold}
{BOLD}{BLACK}  been ashore for long. Fishing nets hang over the side of the boat.{bold}

campfire fire~
   
{bold}{RED}  This seems like a semi-permanent campfire. Rocks line the edge of the{bold}
{bold}{RED}  small pit dug in the sand. Fish have been placed on rocks located{bold}
{bold}{RED}  inside the pit. You can feel t{BOLD}{BLACK}he{bold}{RED} {BOLD}{BLACK}heat radiating from the embers and{bold}
{BOLD}{BLACK}  smell the pleasant aroma from the cooking fish.{bold}
