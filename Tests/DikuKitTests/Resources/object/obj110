  Only through the help of those adventurers

  journey in the evil Sultan's prison. Good luck!

  them.  They perfect the skills/spells by using them. The
  phrase "You learn from your mistake" is one avatars become 
  very familiar with.

  extra equipment locations of the other advanced classes.

                  Getting Sacced (It's BAD too!)

  Along with rerolling, this is one of the worst things that
  can happen to a player.  Imagine the following scene:
 {W,BO}
  You're walking along, killing mobs in a zone.  All of a
  sudden you come upon one that is either aggressive and
  starts killing you, or is just too powerful for you. At
  any rate, you die.  Someone goes back for your corpse, and
  brings it to you.  Sadly, most of your equipment is missing.
  You accuse the other person of taking your equipment, but
  when someone casts 'locate object' to find it, it can't be
  found on the whole mud.  It appears that you've been sacced.
 {M,BO}
  See, there are certain creatures on NC that are so vile and
 {M,BO} despicable, that they would strip your corpse of its equip-
 {M,BO} ment and sacrifice it to their foul gods.  There is no way
 {M,BO} to retrieve sacrificed items.  So be wary of saccing mobs.{m,bo}

                 Rerolling (It's a BAD THING!)

  On Northern Crossroads, the term "rerolling" is heard often.
  Rerolling is a very bad thing.  In fact, it is almost the worst
  thing that can happen to a player.

  As you may remember from the beginning of this book, there
  are different attributes.  One of the most important attributes
  is con (short for constitution)  Constitution is another way
  of describing how you deal with life's little mishaps.  The
  higher it is, the sooner you can regenerate hitpoints, mana,
  and movement.  

  Every time you die, you lose a point of con.  If you ever reach
  0 con, then you are rerolled.  This means that your character
  is reset to level 1/0, and all of your stats, spells, and skills
  are set back comparably.  

  To avoid being rerolled, keep your con trained up at Bozo's.  If
  {Y,BO}you've forgotten how to train attributes, just examine 04.

                          The Post Office

  In the past it was quite difficult for people on Northern Crossroads
  to stay in contact with each other. Thus, a post office was set up in   
  town and in each of the 7 clubhouses, so everyone could keep in touch.

  Upon logging into the Northern Crossroads, a message stating
  "YOU HAVE MAIL" will show up on your screen if mail is waiting for
  you at the post office.

  To check to see if you have mail, go to the postmaster and type: check

  To get mail from the postmaster type: receive
  (You will have to type receive for every single piece of mail)

  To read mail, type: read mail
  (For multiple pieces of mail type: read 1.mail, read 2.mail, etc)

                       The Pet Shop

  For those people who wish to have aid and companionship as they go
  about Northern Crossroads, there is the pet shop.  There you can 
  purchase tigers, dragonets, hawks, wolves, rottweilers, beagles,
  puppies, and kittens.  These pets will follow you around and obey
  you, as long as you don't abuse them.  Also, they can't follow you
  into some rooms (no_mob rooms), but they can be helpful to lower 
  level players.

  To see what pets are for sale, type: list

  To buy a pet, type:  buy <pet type> <chosen name for pet>
  Example:  buy kitten Mopsy  (your kitten would be named Mopsy)

  To command your pet, type:  order <pet type or pet name> <command>
  Example:  order Mopsy kill cityguard

                   Stuart's Butcher Shop

  The citizens of Northern Crossroads had long lamented the fact
  that most of the corpses of the creatures they killed were going
  to waste.  With so many mouths to feed, it seemed uneconomical 
  to just leave the corpses to decay in the fields.  Thus, Stuart
  the Butcher was hired to take care of certain animal corpses.

  At his butcher shop, Stuart will give a fair amount of gold for
  certain rabbit, bear, duck, sheep, pig, deer, and cattle corpses.

  If you kill one of the aforementioned animals, and it has just 1
  gold coin in its corpse, this will often mean that the corpse can
  be sold to Stuart.  Just pick up the corpse after you've killed 
  the animal, remove everything from it, and go to Stuart's Butcher
  Shop.  

 {Y,BO} To see how much a corpse is worth type:  value corpse

  You guessed it!  At the weapon shop you can buy...weapons!
  The weaponsmith has an assortment of weapons that you can
  purchase at a low cost.  Of course the quality of these 
  weapons isn't as good as those you can get by zoning, but
  it is an improvement over going weaponless.  

  Not only can you buy weapons, but you can also sell the
  weaponsmith your own extra weapons!  Be careful though, 
  some of the best weapons have a low cash value to the
  weaponsmith, and it might be better to auction them. (see
  page on auction in this book)

  To see what the weaponsmith has for sale type: list

  To buy a weapon type: buy <weapon name>

 {W,BO} To see how much the weaponsmith will pay you for a certain

  Many people have lost lots of good equipment by failing to keep
  it repaired.  To avoid this catastrophe, be sure to visit the
  blacksmith often.  Equipment that is not kept in repair is prone
  to breaking during battle.  To get your equipment repaired, just
  go to the blacksmith.  

  To repair all the eq you are WEARING type:  repair all
  To repair a piece of eq in your inventory type:  repair <eq name>

             Getting Your Second Class

  Once you have reached level 15, you are prepared to
  receive your 2nd class.  To do this, you must journey
  to Paladine's Temple.  Look up the dirs by typing dirs.
  A shrine moves about the grounds of the temple.  You
  must find this shrine.  You may want to have someone
  assist you with this.  Upon finding it, type pray shrine
  <desired 2nd class name>.  To choose a 2nd class, you
  must see what classes are forbidden to your race.  Type
  race.  You will see a list of races and their numbers.  Type
  race <your race num>.  In the info listed, there should be
  a category named impossibilities.  Any classes listed there
  are forbidden to your race.  Your second class must be
  different from your first class, and it must be one of the
  basic 4 classes (thief, mage, warrior, or cleric)

                  Skills/Spells and How to Learn Them

  Every class has a number of skills/spells that are
  unique to that class.  Typing pract will show you
  what skills/spells you have available to learn as
  well as how well you know them.  Most skills/spells
  listed when you type pract may be trained by your guild-
  master.  Directions to your guildmaster, from Market,
  may be found by typing dirs.

  Once you have found your guildmaster in your guild, simply
  type pract <spell/skill name>.  If your intelligence is
  trained to its max, it will only take 2 practice sessions
  to perfect any skill or spell in your guild.

  However, if your guildmaster is unable to teach you a
  skill or spell on your pract list, check for spelling errors.
  If the spelling is ok, you may want to see if it is a race skill
  or spell, which would need to be trained at your race trainer. {y,bo}

             Attributes and How to Train Them

  Attributes are very important.  Every character
  has a certain amount of strength, constitution,
  dexterity, wisdom, and intelligence that will factor
  into how well he or she fights, casts spells, and
  regenerates.  Also, the higher ones attributes
  are trained, the more hitpoints/mana/movement he
  or she will get with each level.  Thus, it is good
  to have these trained to your racial max.

  To train attributes, go to Bozo's, which is up from
  Market Square.  Type train <attribute name>.
  The attributes are often abbreviated as str, con,
  dex, wis, and int.  It costs 4 practice sessions to
  increase your main attribute and 6 sessions for
  other attributes.  Your number of sessions left
  can be seen by typing att.

                       How to Train Levels

  Before you try to train a level, be sure that 
  you have enough experience by typing score.  This
  will show you how many exp points you currently have.
  Next, type level to see a chart of how much exp is
  needed for each level.  If you have enough for your
  next level, then you need to go visit Bozo.

  Bozo, the Master Trainer, can often be found in his
  training room directly up from Market Sq. When
  you log onto NC, you log in at the Golden Temple.  From
  here, simply go 2 south, and you will be at Market.

  Now, you choose which class you want to train.  For
  example, if you are a warrior/mage, you can train
  either your warrior or mage class.  To train, simply go
  to Bozo and type train level <1st or 2nd class name>.
  Do this until he tells you to stop, and you will gain levels. {r,bo}

               How to Gain Experience

  To gain experience, you simply kill mobs.
  (Mobs are the different creatures that roam
  the Crossroads.)  Always be sure to consider
  the mobs by typing con <mob name> to see
  if you are powerful enough to slay them.  If
  the odds do not seem favorable, then it is best
  not to attack the mob.

  Based on the difficulty of the mob, you will
  get varying levels of experience points.  There
  is a maximum number of experience points per
  level that can be gained by killing mobs.

  {CY,BO}Side note:  {MA,BO}Be sure to type auto all, so you
  will loot mob corpses for gold and items automatically.

           How to Find Your Way Around NC

  The dirs command is a very handy tool for finding
  your way around the Crossroads.  Simply type dirs
  and a huge list of directions to most of the zones
  on the mud will appear.  These directions all refer
  to Market Square as your place of start.

  Often, level suggestions will appear beside the
  directions for a zone.  Be sure to follow these, 
  otherwise, your explorations could easily end in
  death.  {cy,bo}

                    Mortal Kombat

  Occasionally kombats will take place on the mud.  They
  will be announced on the kombat channel (chan kombat).

  In a kombat, anyone within the level restrictions announced
  for the kombat wishing to join is transported to another zone
  where they will fight all of the other combatants to the death
  until only one player remains.  This player is the kombat 
  winner.  On occasion, kombats will be held for prizes.

  There is no loss of con (constitution) from death in a 
  kombat.

  To enter, simply type kombat when a kombat has been opened
  and announced on the kombat channel.

                        Chaos

  The word "chaos" explains it all.  When this mode has
  been turned on, the mud is engulfed in turmoil.  Only
  those players under level 15 are really safe during
  chaos.

  When chaos has been turned on (you can see what mode
  NC is in by typing status), players are virtually un-
  restricted in killing each other.

  There is no con (constitution) loss in chaos unless you
  are killed in your clubhouse.  Chaos can be very fun 
  and exciting.  However, it can be difficult at times to
  retrieve equipment from your corpse without being killed
  all over again.

  Many players choose to hide out in their clubhouses to
  avoid the melee during chaos. {r,bo}

                             Challenge
  
  A challenge is when one player challenges another player
  to a round of one on one combat.  The syntax for this 
  is challenge <player name>.  To accept a challenge 
  type challenge accept.  To decline a challenge type
  challenge decline.

  If someone challenges you, and you do not respond, the
  challenge will expire after 2 ticks (mud hours).
  There are no level restrictions on challenges, so a
  level 50 advanced character could challenge a level 1 
  dual character.

  There is no con (constitution) loss unless one of the
  characters is pk (player killer), in which case the loser
  will suffer the loss of one point of con.

  Basically, challenges are ways for players to show their 
  {BLU,BO}prowess and earn their bragging rights. {blu,bo}

  {Y,BO}           Dying on NC and Corpse Retrieval

  Death is just another part of the circle of life on
  Northern Crossroads.  It isn't fun, but there are a
  few guidelines you can follow to make getting your
  eq from your corpse easier.

  1.  Remember where you died, because if you can provide
      the location of your demise, it will be easier for
      someone to find your corpse and get your stuff
      for you.

  2.  Know the name of the mob that killed you.  This way
      others can offer you advice on how best to kill the
      mob and get your stuff back.

  3.  Gossip for help if you need it.  You could possibly
      get your stuff back on your own, but if the mob has
      memory, it will kill you all over again.

  {Y,BO}4.  Hope that the mob is not "saccing" (sacrificing). If
      so, expect part or all of your eq to be missing.

  Ask other players for info before exploring a new zone.

 {BLU,BO}                        Clubs on NC
  There are 7 clubs on NC.  These clubs all have a min. suggested level
  for new players to reach before they can join.  Each club has the
  right to deny membership to anyone. Often, membership is the final   
  decision of the club leader.  Some clubs are pk (player killing),
  which means they allow pking, but don't force it on their members. {CY,BO}

  Everyone gets hungry on NC.  This is just another fact of real
  life that is reflected in mud life.  Thus a bakery was erected in
  Midgaard to provide low cost snacks for the hungry citizens of
  Northern Crossroads.  If you go for extended periods without food,
  or drink you will actually lose hitpoints, so don't deny yourself!
 {BLU,BO} At the bakery you can buy:
  {Y,BO}  A large piece of cake for 16 gold coins.
    A danish pastry for 5 gold coins.
    A loaf of bread for 11 gold coins.

            The Levee (Canoes and Rafts)

  There are certain places on Northern Crossroads that can only be
  reached by crossing large bodies of water.  Although it is
  possible to swim across some of these, others are too large to
  swim across. Withhout a watercraft of some sort, or the ability
  to fly, you can't travel to these lands.  A watercraft only has
  to be in your inventory for it to work.

  This need for watercraft prompted an old, retired sea captain to
  set up shop at the levee.  There he sells canoes and rafts to those
  who need them.  He will also purchase used watercraft from those
  people who are finished with them.

           Hotels (Renting and Exiting the Game)

  When you have tired of adventuring on Northern Crossroads, and wish
  to leave, then it is time for you to visit one of our fine hotels.  
  Victor's Hotel de Royal services all the players on NC.  Each club 
  also has its own 5-star hotel.

  At the hotel you may rent out, and the receptionist will store all
  of your equipment for you until you come back.  Be sure to have
  enough gold to pay for the length of your stay.  Otherwise, the hotel 
  staff will throw out your stuff.  Certain items may not be rented at 
  the hotels, these include:  cursed objects, keys, notes, corpses, and 
  mail.  Also, the hotel staff is biased against maimed people. So, if 
  you have been maimed, you can't rent until you've regenerated.

                           Auctions

  In the past when people wanted to sell a piece of equipment,
  they had to ask over gossip to see if anyone wanted it, and
  undergo the hassle of deciding who offered the best price.

  Now, however, there is the auction channel.  This channel is
  devoted to the selling of equipment.  To channel into it
  type: channel auction.  

  Non-auctionable items include:  food, non-empty containers, 
  corpses, potions, keys, and items of type trash.

  To auction an item type:  auction <item> <minimum bid price>

  To remove an item your auctioning from the auction

                  Getting Acided (It's kind of bad)

  Although this isn't nearly as bad as getting rerolled or
  sacced, it isn't good either.  Certain mobs on NC are
  notorious for spitting acid.  This acid will eat away at
  your equipment, making it less protective.

  Acided equipment gets a number of AC (Armor class) points
  added to it.  At first this sounds good, but the goal of
  every player is to have low AC.  The higher your AC is,
  the more likely you are to be hit by your opponent.  Thus,
  getting acided is very bad.

 {G} There is an acid repair quest.  However, it is geared 
 {G} toward advanced characters.  If you need help with acided
 {G} gear, simply ask for it over gossip, and one of the kind
 {G} players will give you more information or help. {g}

                   Ignoring Fellow Players

  Have you ever met a player that you just couldn't stand?
  A player who constantly annoys and pesters you?  If so,
  then you may be interested in the ignore command.

  By using the ignore command, you can choose to ignore
  all or some communication from a player.

  You can ignore the following
  forms of communication:  {W,BO}say shout tell call irc
                           gossip chat flame esp cgossip
                           all none

  {BLU,BO}To ignore a player type:  {W,BO}ignore {BLU,BO}<{W,BO}player name{BLU,BO}> <{W,BO}field{BLU,BO}>
  Example:  {W,BO}ignore CookieMonster all{BLU,BO} would ignore all 
            communication from CookieMonster
            {W,BO}ignore CookieMonster tell{BLU,BO} will just ignore
            tells from him

 {BLU,BO} The ignore command is just another way to enjoy hassle-
 {BLU,BO} free mudding.{blu,bo}

                 Advanced Classes on NC

  There are 6 advanced classes on NC.  These are: archmage,
  assassin, blademaster, druid, avatar, and hero. When 
  advancing from dual to an advanced character, your new
  advanced class is dependant on your first class as a dual.
  First Class:    Advanced Class Possibilities:
 {Y}  Mage             Archmage, Avatar
   Cleric           Druid, Avatar
   Thief            Assassin, Avatar
   Warrior          Blademaster, Avatar{R,BO}
  Once you advance, you will be level 1 in whichever advanced
  class you chose.  You can now advance an additional 50 levels.
  Bozo is unnecessary.  Whenever you get enough experience, you 
  will level automatically.  To train your advanced skills/spells,
  you must go to your advanced guildmaster.  This training costs
  gold and experience. Avatars and heroes don't train this way.
  Only level 50 avatars can advance to heroes.

  {CY}            Becoming an Archmage

  To become an archmage you need to be level 50/50, and your
  first class must be mage. Then, you must travel to the Chancellor
  of the Unseen University. 
  Directions to the Chancellor are:
        15w,2s,e,s,w,s,2w,s,w,n,3w,n,w,3n,3s,
        w,s,n,kill golem,n,3e,open door,2n,u,
        3w,4s,4e,4n,u,4w,4s,4e,2n,open door,e
  Once you have located the Chancellor, just type: pract
  This will advance you to level 1 Archmage.  
  To train your archmage spells, go back to the Chancellor and type
  pract <spell name>.  This will cost you experience and money.
  Archmages can't use shields or hold weapons, aren't permitted
  to use weapons with 3 or more attacks, and several body locations
 {CY} become limited in the amount of damroll or hitroll from equipment.
 {CY} Archmages are the only class to wear rune markings and eyeglasses.

                   Donation and Its Benefits

  Often players run low on money and can't buy good equipment
  from stores, other players, or auction.  Or, a player will
  have a run-in with a saccing mob and lose all his or her 
  equipment.  For these reasons, donation rooms were created.

  Players who have extra equipment that they don't need can 
  type: donate <equipment name>  This will automatically put
  the equipment in Midgaard's Donation Room.  However, if the
  equipment is limited, it will be destroyed in the transfer.

  Clubs have their own donation rooms, to which equipment can
  be donated by typing: cdon <equipment name>  This will put
 {GR,BO} the equipment in your club's donation room.  Once again, all
 {GR,BO} limited eq will be destroyed in transfer.

 {GR,BO} Midgaard's Donation Room is 2n, e from Market Square. Often
 {GR,BO} spare equipment will be found there.  Take what you need, but
 {GR,BO} don't be greedy!{gr,bo}

cake wedding slice~
 {W,BO}
  Looking at this slice of wedding cake makes 
  your mouth water.  It's sweet, sugary aroma
  fills the room.  Roses and other flowers made
  of icing decorate the cake.  Rathus and his
  bride, Shalene, sure have good taste.

cup punch glass~
  {M,BO}
  It appears to be a cup of fruit punch.  The outside
  of the clear cup has little white wedding bells on
  it.  How cute!  The punch itself tastes awesome, it's
  very fruity and sweet, with a slight taste of...
  ALCOHOL!!!  Someone's spiked it with jolt!
