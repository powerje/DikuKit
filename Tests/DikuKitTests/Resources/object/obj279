The dumpster is filled to the overflowing with rotten garbage, and
a lot of disgusting half decomposed corpses that have had all the 
meaty portions removed. In the back of the dumpster, you can make 
out a small part that seems to be clear.. almost as though that
cylindrical area is maintained by a mystical force. It looks like a
conduit.. like a mystical entrance to something or somewhere. Then
again maybe not.

  Come one, come all to the newly opened Pizza Hut franchise
near you. Come with some friends because you may need to
clear a passage into the building for yourself because of
the many people that will be rushing in.
   It is located east of town. Head east on the Main Street
highway, and then hang a north about three miles east of
the Turning Point intersection.
  Step lightly, and watch your back. The trip is definitely
worth it. See you there.

      The Pizza Hut Corporation.

Upon closer examination you realize that this candy cane is in fact very special. It seems
to glow with an inner light of its own. It seems to be endowed with powers of its own.
It calls to you, and before you know what you are doing you are biting into the long hard
length of a red and white striped candy cane. The sugary juice bath your tongue with the best
tasting fluids you have ever tasting in your life. This is a one in a lifetime taste. You look
over your shoulder and perr suspiciously at everyone passing. NO ONE WILL TAKE THIS AWAY FROM YOU!
