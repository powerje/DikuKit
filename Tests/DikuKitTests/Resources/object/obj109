     Greetings brave souls.  Congrats on getting up the courage to
     enter this place.  Hope you brought a big group of healthy Avatars.
     Here are a few pointers on your survival here.  I think it will
     help you survive just long enough to get out with your life.
     1.) There is only one exit out of Alcatra, and you only have
         a certain amount of time to get there.
     2.)  Both of these keys are timed.  Keep an eye on the time
          remaining.  You have to get to the exit before it expires.
          If you don't, you will be trapped in here and I don't think
          the inmates will mind some fresh meat to spank and poke
          and have there way with.....If you know what I mean!!
Good luck....You'll need it

     Here are a few pointers on your survival here.  I think it will
     help you escape with your life.
     1.) There is only one exit out of Alcatraz.  You only have
         a certain amount of time to get there, so DON'T be greedy!
     2.)  These keys are timed so watch them carefully.  You have to 
          get to the exit before it expires.  If you don't, you will be trapped
          here until the next reboot, and that will be unhealthy!
Good luck....You'll need it
