jagged shiney metal key~
   A small shiney piece of metal alloy.  It is very cold to the touch.
The jagged edges of the metal give it a crude sharpness.  It is roughly
three inches long, and a half inch thick.  Although it is quite small, the
piece of metal weighs quite a bit.

Welcome to the Xfiles Quest.  This quest is designed to give players the
opportunity to lose thier aliens flag.  This quest MUST be completed alone.
Since this quest is the only sure way to lose the flag it has been designed
to be fairly difficult.  You should expect to die several times.  Some
mobiles in this quest scavenge, some may even sac.  If you're not careful, 
you may even find a death trap.  So take care on your travels, and good luck.
