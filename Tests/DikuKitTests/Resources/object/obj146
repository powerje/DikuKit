  {BLA}{BOLD}The {R}Crimson{BLA} Knights, led by the monster {Y}Kenku Ma'ar Duvall{BLA}, were
one of the most destructive forces of the old world.  Wreaking havoc
upon anyone who spoke against them or acted malignantly toward a +CK+
member, the {R}Crimson{BLA} Knights alone held the world in an iron grip.  The
great apocolypse known only by the most ancient beings alive today brought
about the end of the {R}+{BLA}CK{R}+{BLA} empire.  This shattered remnant of the armor of
{Y}Kenku{BLA} is all that is left.{bla}
