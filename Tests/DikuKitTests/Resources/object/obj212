   {WH}It is believed that Lucky has again hidden the magic marshmellows of the
   famous Lucky Charms breakfast cereal.  He has vowed before he meets his maker
   that the whole world will know that Lucky Charms is "magically delicious".

   Your job is to find as many marshmellows as you can and return them to the
   designated person before anyone else gets their hands on them.  Lucky's only
   hope at peace when he meets his maker is to know that the tasty treats have
   not fallen into the wrong hands.{wh}

   {CY}This report was brought to you by Cruz, The "Lucky Charms Elf" historian.{cy}

page3~

   {CY}Two years ago General Mills tried to replace Lucky with the Trix rabbit.
   Lucky broke four of the silly rabbits teeth and ever since then he hasn't been
   able to eat a bowl of his own cereal.  Last year they attempted to bring back
   Waldo the wizard, who was first introduced in the mid 70's.  When Lucky got
   wind of this he found Waldo behind the local pub after having one to many
   drinks and he torched his wizard hat while his head was still in it.  Waldo
   was admitted to the burn ward at St. Jude's hospital where he is still
   recovering from the torture he sustained at the hands of Lucky.  Casper and
   Frankenberry have received offers from General Mills to take over Lucky's old
   job, but both have refused.  Count Chocula is currently at the offer table 
   negotiating his contract and has expressed some interest in the position.{cy}

   {CY}In the news today (3/17/99), it was reported that a suit was filed against
   "all of the wee bastards who crave my marshmallows/and the company that
   stabbed me back". The suit was filed in the U.S. Supreme Court by "Lucky"
   the Leprechaun, a subcontractor for Lucky Charms cereal who changes plain
   old marshmallows into colorful, tasty treats.  Your quest is to find all
   me lucky charms before they fall into the wrong hands!

   {CY}Lucky vs The World{cy}

   {WH}News Wire{RE} *{CY}/03-17-2002 In the news today it was reported that the suit
   filed 3 years ago has taken an unexpected turn.  It seems Lucky has been
   arrested for three counts of murder in the first degree.  He apparently
   killed off the the CEO, CFO and CIO of General Mills after arguments about
   his use of the slogan "They're magically delicious".  An injunction barring
   the use of the phrase was placed on General Mills two years ago claiming
   the slogan was "false and misleading".  Opinions are mixed over the case.
   Most people seem to feel the deaths of the top brass was too be expected
   for attempting to stimey Lucky from (quote) "Just doing his job".{cy}
