bowl rafiki ancient~


This beautiful hand crafted item holds many secrets. Just the look of it gives
you a sense of a deeper knowledge and strength. The bowl is nothing more than
a crafted piece of clay with small etchings written in an unfamiliar language.

jaw nala~


As you look closely at this strange skeleton, you can still make out what seems
to be pieces of flesh still embedded between it's teeth. Great power must have
belonged to the owner of this once attached jaw bone.

claw skar~

Long nails stem from this hairy and tattered claw. It's enormous when held close
to your own hand. The nails protrude at least 3 inches away from it. That sure looks
sharp. You imagine cutting into your enemy.
