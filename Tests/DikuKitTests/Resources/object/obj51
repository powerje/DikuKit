They seem to be ordinary rugged pants that some poor beggar dropped.
There are no unusual or unordinary glows or humming noises from the pants
either.  You get an itch to try them on and peer around the surround area for
anyone staring at you and then proceed to place one leg into the
pants followed by the other.  After pulling them up to your waiste and
buttoning them, you say to yourself, "Gosh I look stunning, don't I?"

This ring appear to have been well-hidden amongst the goblin slave 
population for many years.  It seems to be the only item of value that
they owned, and you stole it from them.  According to legend, a Goblin-thief
stealthily pick-pocketed the ring from a Drow guardsman and hid it in
a bag where no one but the Goblins could find it.
Several days later, through torture and pain, one of the goblins admitted as to
who stole the ring.  The thief refused to reveal the location and died
instantly from the Matron Mother.

makes your stomach turn, and the smell doesn't help.  You see no possible reason
for a piece of cheese to be in a cellar such as this and kick it off to the
corner, hoping it will kick the smell away.  Just as you kick it, a faint 
metal sound can be heard.  You curiously pick up the cheese and peer intently
at it.  Looking carefully you notice a small key hidden in the center of
