  The Computer World Superstore is open for business!  At 17 East and 1 UP 
from Market [] it is sure to meet your particular shopping needs.
  Players from mid-dual classes (with good eq or in groups) will find much
good XP.  Small groups of higher avatars can collect the EQ.
  There are THREE pcs. of eq. to be had in the zone.  All of it top grade,
no junk.  The big payoff is a new, 2 hit weapon.  It may be the best on the
mud - 10d6 and LOTSA other nice stuff on it.  All eq is limited, don't be
late ;).
  No DT's, No Saccing mobs.  The higher eq guarding mobs breathe gas.  The
weapon is hidden in the maze.  The maze is a tough one to crack, but you
CAN get in if you use your head.
  Comments and/or criticisms are welcomed.
