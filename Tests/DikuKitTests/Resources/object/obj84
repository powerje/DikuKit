The pictures plastered to the fridge are mostly taken in poor lighting
attributed to the fact that the glitter ball screwed up the flash.  Most

humorous is the one of Byron parading around with panties on his head.

  You see a massive, HUMONGOUS birthday cake.  It has 8, no 9 layers.
It glitters and twinkles with enchanted, edible decorations in
shades of color you never imagined.  It looks more like a
holiday decoration than a simple birthday cake.  In foot tall
holographic letters, the name: ZOHARN orbits the delicacy at
the, ah, altitude of the top layer.  You can't tell what flavor
the cake is until you bite into it.  It's your favorite flavor.
It's ALWAYS your favorite flavor, it's a magic cake!!
