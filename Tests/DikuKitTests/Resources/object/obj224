Ahmad Husan,
                                
  After being out in the desert for five heat blistering days
                               
  we finally discovered the hidden location to the centaur camp.
                                
  We fought endlessly until we breached the camp, then as we
                               
  made it inside, we found ourselves out numbered so we fled for
                                  
  our lives. Before we escaped I managed to kill a centaur guard
                                 
  holding a key. Enclosed in this parchment, I have left you with
                                 
  the key I took off the guard, hopefully it will come in handy
                                   
  later if you decide to make your way back there.
                                 
                                              Askarian Warrior,
