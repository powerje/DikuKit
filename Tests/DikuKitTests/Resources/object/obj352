  The faint scent of aged leather clings to the
  yellowed pages of this book.  Across the top you
  see "{Y,BO}Arianne's Complete Guide to NC for Newbies{y,bo}{Y}"
  embossed in flowing script.  The book itself glows
  with an eerie light.  As you thumb through the 
  pages, you feel knowledge of mudding on Northern
  Crossroads seep into your veins.  A heightened
  level of understanding sweeps over you.

  To begin reading the book type:  exa index1
