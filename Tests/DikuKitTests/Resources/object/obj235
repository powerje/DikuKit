   There is a doorway of sorts here. It is the opening that all of the
statues look towards. When you examine it a bit closer you notice that
the entrance appears to be a bit blurred. Perhaps it is the heat casting
shadows or perhaps not.

   These gloves emanate a powerful spiritual aura. You can
sense the power that flows out from them. It is obvious that
mere mortal hands played no part in their construction. They
seem to be made of some kind of flowing metal. It is surprisingly
strong and yet at the same time supple. The metal flows and 
takes on the shape of your hand without losing any of the 
immense strength they so obviously possess.

   Runic marking covers most if not all of the fabric on the robe. The

on the fabric that they are actually floating on it. The impression is that
of each rune being a small boat on a vast sea of fabric. There is great 
power in this robe. So much power that any mage would likely give his very 
soul to be able to say that they owned such a garment.

it. You don't know how it is that you feel that but it is as if when you
picked the bracer up that it made you feel safe and protected. Truly this 
is a wonderful gift from the gods.

object it slices through as though it were a hand passing through air. Surely
this is an object created by the finest craftsmen of the gods.

   This is the statue of a middle aged man. He has a very sad look on his face
and appears to be crying. He has his hands held out to the room as if he is trying
to reach for something. It looks as though whatever it is that he wants may be 
just out of his reach.

Dear Terrekin,
   Please make sure that you speak to Bruno. We need to start working on 
our plan for getting rid of these damned Zoanoids. I am afraid that they
are gaining more of a grip on our world with each passing day. Bruno will
be able to tell you what we need you to do. He will be at a secret lab
that we have set up in the woods. I have marked the side of the road with
some stones just north of town. Just go a little east from there and turn 
back to the west. From there he is pretty easy to find. 
 
              Good luck, we are going to need it...
  
                                      Vesca
