broken wing~



   The broken wing of a mythological winged beast. Being
   able to use the wing that he tried to strike with is
   more than an honor. To demonstrate the size of the beast
   that this wing once belonged to, the wing is as nearly
   as long as a full grown man's arm.  After a handle was
   carved in to the base, the flesh of the snake was used to
   create an elaborate handle.

horn unicorn~
 
     The horn broken from the skull of a dead unicorn.  While
     the history of this artifact is quite dark, the leftover
     magic of the creature's life has left it with an inner
     light that seems to never fade.
