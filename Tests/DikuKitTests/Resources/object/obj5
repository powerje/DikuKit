  With more vacancies on the High Council than members, Shoju and I set about listening to 
  the clubbies. It seemed that Wilder, Danger, and Chronos were the perfect candidates to 
  bring -={Y,BO}FM{y,bo}{C}=- into a brighter future. Things were looking pretty grim despite the return of
  and/or occassional visits of Grizzly, Gore, Maverik, Caveman, Grimreaper, Danger and Renatus.
  Clubbies we all knew and loved wandered off as well. Some to never return and some only to 
  test the waters of the world. We will miss such members as Pegasus, Yupa, Nero, Dragall, and Robo.
{C} 
  When bad things happen, the club seems to strengthen and regroup. In this case, the bad things
  were HC statues. The good thing was the return of {Y,BO}Majere{y,bo}{C}. Majere stepped in to help put 
  the club back on track and only 2003 can tell what will come of that.

  Sparky began the High Council again and in June the first meetings were held. Shoju, Quinn,
  Wildstar, Sparky, and I set forth to turn things around and show the world that -=FM=- was 
  still the same club as always if not better. This didn't last long. Sparky, Shoju and I had
  a difference of opinion which led Sparky to return to real life and leave the club to sink 
  or swim under the HC which he said was letting him down when we had just begun. Not too long
  after Wildstar and Quinn moved on to other adventures and other clubs.

  The year got off to a great start. The club was very active. (-FM-) lit up the who list.
  Sparky's return brought promise of the reinstitution of the High Council. For ever member
  that wandered from home, we gained three others. During this time Jiayi and Neysa followed
  Aenima out the door. (Aenima, Sparky, TheLady, and myself had a difference in opinion about
  where the club was heading and should head.) Majere and Zieb still seemed to be names not
  leaders in the minds of the clubbies.

  As the year progressed, Sparky introduced himself to me. Soon after I met TheLady. 
  The two of them met often with me and shared some of the tradition which I had become
  a part of. They talked of wars and friends. They talked of the High Council and Zieb 
  before he became a COMM. They dropped names like {Y,BO}Warlord{y,bo}{C}, {Y,BO}Morlock{y,bo}{C}, {Y,BO}Phantasmagoria{y,bo}{C}, 
  {Y,BO}Caveman{y,bo}{C}, and {Y,BO}Maverik{y,bo}{C}. One thing was certain, they love -={Y,BO}FM{y,bo}{C}=- with all 
  their hearts.

  Though we were surrounded by greatness. The club seemed lawless and Serenity was quick
  to point that out. We listened intently and were unsure of what to do. The club seemed 
  to cry out for help...

  I, Koozl, joined -={Y,BO}FM{y,bo}{C}=- in mid-July of 2001. At that time, Jiayi
  and Neysa seemed to be in leadership of the club. There were other immortals 
  that logged on, but none that were held in the same esteem as those two. They led
  the club both as friends and as zoners. 
{C}  
  Not to be mistaken, this was still during the reign of Zieb and Majere. However, 
  as both had moved up to the COMMITTEE and were both attending school, they had 
  little time to spend on club issues. It was explained to me that Zieb had elevated
  Jiayi's status to club level 10 and asked him to care for all of us. And so, Jiayi did.

 The hours we spend mudding have drawn us together 
  as a family of friends. Over the years friends have
  come and some have gone. The Flying Maveriks
  have been through a lot. Yet in the end we stand
  together as one. 
{C}
  This book is my tribute to all of us. It is my
  hope that through the years to come, it will be
  updated keeping the -=FM=- traditions and history
  alive. In doing so, the good and the bad should
  be recorded. As I can only speak of what occured
  in my days, the information in the book is sure
  to be incomplete.

  {C}Honour{G}.  We are the driving force of {C}Justice{G} within
  the Northern Crossroads, acting in a way that should
  be duplicated by all.  This means that we act as an

  My mud name is Dragonblood, I don't have any alt

  My real name is {WH}Christopher Justin Vobis{BLU,BO}.
  I have a wife whose mud name is Dragonbane and a son 
  named Michael, who is 9 months old.
  I'm 19 years old and have been mudding for approximately 
  6 years(U would think I would be better at it , huh :P)
{BLU,BO}
  Anyway the gist of it is that I think of FM as a second 
  family. We help each other when needed, and are always
  friendly to each other(most of the time). It's groups like 
  this that drew me to mudding, well that and the fantasy 
  genre.

    The first time I happened to log in to NC I was totally confused.
  It seemed a bit overwhelming, really - so many add-ons and changes 
  to the original DIKU design.  But a surprise visit from Wysiwyg really 
  welcomed me into the Northern Crossroads.  I was happy at the helpfulness
  of the mudders here and impressed by the depth of the mud design.  
    I eventually ended up joining FM because of the warm spirit and impressive
  power that its halls contained. I have since been continually impressed by 
  its family atmosphere.  Eventually, I was added to the High Council because 
  of my zeal to improve FM even more.
     I think FM can become the most powerful club on NC while retaining its
  kind nature. So let us continue Wysiwyg's spirit of compassion.
  Let us strengthen ourselves, push forward, and brand Northern Crossroads with 
  the name Flying Maveriks forever.

  Ummm..I have 3 cats.

  I have been on NC for almost 10 years and in -FM- just
  as long.  I have met so many great people here that I 
  can't say hello to everyone individually.  Thank you 
  all for for putting up with me for so long!  NC has 
  changed a great deal since I started, most of it for 
  the better.  I remember when I first started that there 
  were daily crashes that lasted for hours and sometimes 
  days. I hope that I can stay around for at least 10 more
  years and do my part to help out.

  Shashi and Koozl hang around like best of freinds
  probably because as sisters that's what they are.
  It is hoped that Shashi will one day be able to
  return to NC though the likelihood of that happening
  while she still lives under her father's roof is
  slim. Until then, she will be missed by all.

small note~
Welcome to the new clubhouse!  It will take a little time to get use to,
but I am hoping you will all like it a lot, or help me make it better.
   
  Some basic directions you should know:
     Market Square - n (of recall)
     Blacksmith's - u,2n (of recall)
     Hotel - u,3s (of recall)
     Board Room - u,3e,n (of recall)
     Mail Room - u,3e,s (of recall)
The rest of the directions you can hopefully figure out for yourself.
   
     {RE,BO}Warning: If you go through the maze, you CAN DT!  Be aware!{bo}
   
  I want to thank everyone who helped on this project, mainly Niniel,
Tattle, Sparky, and Macero.  Lots more helped, and I am thankful to you
also.

   This is unlike any weapon you have ever seen before. when you grab it
it molds to your hand. This metal seems to be alive. When you look at it
you notice it is constantly changing and when in battle it changes so fast 
you do not know what is is doing.
