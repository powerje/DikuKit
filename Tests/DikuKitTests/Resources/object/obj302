corpse~

You see before you a rotting corpse of a once proud Orcish raider who felt that he
himself had what it could take to defeat the army of the Light.  He seemed to be quite
insane, however, considering he merely equipped himself with some minor weapons and
light-crafted armor and a small array of potions.   Upon closer investigation, a
dazzling object glows brightly around his index finger on his right hand.  The item
seems to emit a glow that surrounds the Orc in a peculiar way.
