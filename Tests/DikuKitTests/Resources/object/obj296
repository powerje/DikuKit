{BO}{C}   This is longest candy bar you have ever seen in
   your life.  It has sharp edges on the wrapper and it 
   seems that the harder you try to open it, the more
   resistant it becomes to any attempt you make.

   Long ago, in a land not so far away (8e, 5n) there was
   a huge palace called the Veleusian Palace where there
   were many villagers and some FINE lookin women...anyway
   everyone was at the daily grind when there was a rumble in
   the distance.  Gradually, the skies began to darken and
   a dead calm pierced the land.  A shadowy figure blinded
   the sun for several minutes and silently drew closer and
   closer. It was...the Veleprocationist.{r}

   Do you wish to help these people defend their meek homes

The Veleusian Palace has been opened on this Thursday,
July 15, 1999 at 11:00 pm.  The zone is for mid to 
high advanced groups of 5-7 people.  I hope that you
and your group have many fun times in this moderately
difficult zone.

Good Luck,

   The {Y}I{R}nner {G}C{R}ircle is a highly secretive clan born from the fittest members
   of the Guild of {BO}{B}Assassins{R}.  Until recently, this guild was only fabled to
   exist.  Citizens travelling through the western {bo}{G}forests{BO}{R} who claimed that
   they saw persons with the dreaded {BLU}<{R}T{Y}I{G}C{BLU}>{R} emblem tattooed on their neck have
   always mysteriously {BO}{B}died{R} in unexplainable accidental {Y}fires{R}, {C}drownings{R}, or
   {BO}{B}suicides{R}.  All fear their existence though rumours have it that they are
   {BO}{B}assassins{R} for hire.  Nothing more is known, but corpses of suspected members
   of T{Y}I{G}C{R} are sometimes found with their necks {bo}{Y}skinned{BO}{R} - a strong indication
   of a strict and disciplined internal law and punishment of this fabled

   On a dark, {BLU}stormy{BO}{B} night a long time ago, there were three 
   {R}TiC Assassins{B} passing the time in the Inner Sanctum when 
   suddenly there was a {bo}{W}faint{BO}{B} rustle in the bushes.  It was
   virtually undetectable to the untrained ear, however, the
   sole {BO}{R}TiC Assassin{BO}{B} named {G}Mephisto{B} identified it as a disturbance
   in the force. Knowing the ways of a former brother, {G}Mephisto{B}
   took full advantage of his traitor's mistake and alerted his
   trained mafia of {BLU}elite{B} assassins. Wasting no time, they mobilized
   for attack but not before the former member of TiC took out
   the sentry guarding the clubhouse.  A man with {Y}DUSK{B} carved
   on his soul assisted the struggling {G}Mephisto{B} as the enemies
   were starting to get a tight hold on their positions.
