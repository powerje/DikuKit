altar crystal~
The altar before you was carved from a single, large, smokey white crystal.
It shows a great battle between a powerful mage and several dragons of many
differing colors and sizes.  Also carved into it is the depiction of the 
dragons search for a new home, far from their original land.  All they were
able to bring with them were a few relics of great power, of which your
group has found most, except for the blade.

It shows a great battle between a powerful mage and several dragons of many
different colors and sizes.  The altar also depicts their search for a new
home, and the few artifacts of ancient power that they brought with them.
The altar is cracked in a few places, perhaps the efforts of unknown
vandals caused them as they sought to unlock the altar's secrets.

This is a blubbery mass of skin peeled from the hide of the dead slug.  Slime
still oozes from the pores, making it very slippery and slick.  As large as
it is, it would be easy enough to wrap it around your body and STILL be able
to stuff small things in various folds.
