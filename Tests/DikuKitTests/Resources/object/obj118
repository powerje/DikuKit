flyer~

Date: 6-30-96

The long-awaited re-opening of the X-MANSION has finally arrived.  My zone
is located east of Midgaard (outside town).  From mk[], go all the way east.
It's mainly for lvl 30 non-avatar to lvl 30 avatar players.  As always, for
certain parts, grouping is recommended.

Important info:  The maze is entirely different.  In addition, the mobs and
objects have been modified as well.  Feel free to mudmail me your comments.

It's mainly for lvl 30 non-avatar to lvl 30 avatar players.  However, there
is an area solely for lvl 30-50 avatars.  Those of lower lvls will not be
permitted to enter.  For some parts, grouping is recommended.  I hope that
y'all enjoy it as much as I had fun making it. =) Feel free to mudmail me
