axe battle soulclash soul shodas~

    A huge weapon, as big as a man's chest and wider than your arms
extended, it is unnaturally light. The material it is made of seems to
be wood, yet it is soaked through with blood making it blacker than
tempered steel. Odd runes are carved into its handle and intricate
designs cover the blades....

    Enter this area at your own risk. Spys report that some areas are
labeled as "death traps" and that a few mobs pick up items, some going
so far as to sacrifice them to pagan gods. But a keen eye shall win
out for these are usually easily identifiable and scarce. Also, if you
still dare to venture forth, take with you allies that are trustworthy
and strong.  They should be of level avatar 35+ with 3 or more members.
Be mindful this is for minimul safety only. One last note, our finest
spys just recently brought forth news of a acidic mob, a beast which
can corrode armor with its horrid breath. Fortunately they say that the
beast lives off the main roads and is profoundly marked by warnings so
do not fret. In ending...good luck and god speed if ye go forth lads.
