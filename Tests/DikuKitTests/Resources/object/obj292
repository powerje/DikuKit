You stare at what is some of the most disgusting objects in the entire
universe- the club toilets. A number of person has vomitted in this fine
porcelain vessle. However, you know that it holds a prize that many people
have dreamed of owning, but have not yet experienced the pleasure- the
toilet seat. All you need to do is find something to get this damned thing
off!!

A valuable tool, its uses are many: to remove or tighten screws, pry things

Barely worth wearing at all since it hardly covers the body, but unusally
strong regardless. It only really has one purpose in mind- to stimulate
males. Tight fitting, low cut and extremely revealing.. this could easliy
make any male drop dead in their tracks with the right woman to fill it
in. However, if a man were to wear it.. well.. let's not think about
that, shall we?

You feel its your duty to end the suffering of this ball and put it in

whether you want to get rid of it or keep it. Its incredible level of
self-confidence was almost nauseating, yet its lasted this long on luck
alone. Debating this in your mind, you suddenly realize you have a job
to do, which involves ditching this ball.. which isn't that bad of an
idea. Hmmm.. maybe luck is on your side afterall.

The mystery and mysticism of the midnight black eight ball faintly rests
in your hand, almost like it was slipping in and out of reality itself.
You almost lose the ball once or twice, hiding in the smallest of shadows
and cloaking itself in whatever darkness it can find. Even though jet
black, it remains strangly shiny, almost like it has a glow of its own.
Even though you've mastered the eight ball itself, you seriously doubt
that you'll ever fully understand the mystery of the eight ball.

knowledge and learn from every second of its existance. Although very 
powerful, you realize this power can very easily overpower you once again
if care isn't exercised. You know that this is the last piece of the puzzle
which you need to finish. Although a valuable prize and one that's worth
keeping, you realize it that the goal is worth its sacrifice.

giggle to yourself, as you picture Portia in a jet black dominatrix outfit.. using half
