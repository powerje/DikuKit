case counter~

  A very old glass counter which you cannot see through.  The dust
  on the counter is almost one inch thick and looks like it hasn't
  been disturbed for quite some time.  There appears to be a
  small lock on the back of the counter with a sliding door.  It
  appears that if you had a key, you could see what it holds,
  if anything.

  covering it in random areas on the chest.  It also
  has rather short sleeves and looks like it's worn
  more for style than for comfort or warmth.  But it
  doesn't seem to be all that stylish, now days.  It
  seems to be just a relic from an age when things
  like this were popular.  Although it doesn't look
  like it can keep you warm, it seems, tough, durable,
  and who knows? It may even make you think you're
  tougher than you are.{r}

  {G,BO}The Sony PlayStation used to be the best that personal gaming had
  to offer.  It uses a compact disk instead of a battery cartridge,
  which makes loading, and game play, much faster.  It was also the
  first system to use a memory card to save data.  The system also
  has a few different ports in back for various uses.  These range
  from connecting two playstations together, to plugging in cheat
  devices, to making it internet ready.  Truly, the PlayStation
  revolutionized the gaming industry and got the already hooked
  gamer even more attached.{g,bo}

  Although difficult to describe, this item is simply worn on
  your head, with a small visor going over the eyes.  A thin
  wire leads down and plugs into a large computer which then
  sends an image or series of images into the visor which
  for the user, creates a near realisitic VR environment. In
  this 'world', people can literally do whatever they want,
  when they want.  It's an amazing piece of engineering and
  eletronics.

  just deprived of good pop music, he's the king of pop, and 80's
  superstar who still makes more money than any of us will ever see
  in a lifetime!  The glove he wore was smell, white, made of high
  quality cloth and barely reached his wrist.  It was covered in
  tons of sparkling white diamonds or studs and mainly used for
  show while dancing because of how the lights from his videos
  and concerts reflected off of it.{w,bo}
