It looks like one of those bullet-proof vests squad
teams wear during storm operations.  It has some 
blackened holes, and is very, very heavy.

If you are a newbie, there are mobs for you (yes,
with your regulation equipment on), just use the
command 'consider <MOBNAME>', to know what mobs
you can fight with some success.

Good luck!
