   You hold in you hand a Black Rose of the deepest black.  As you
   look further into its crystalline surfaces you can see no reflections. 
   You peer deeper into its intricate petals and know that your
   brethren stand strongly behind you.  You fear nothing.

        This must be one of the finest pieces of jewelry craftsmenship you
have ever seen. The time and effort involved in making such an item must have
not been cheap and must therefore indicate the amount and quality of love
that must be shared between the donater and recipiant of the ring. As you
study the ring more closely, you notice within the ornate design of the ring
are some hidden intricacies. The name, "TRILLIAN" can clearly be seen, as can
the shape of half a heart. You wonder where the other half is as it can not
be found on the ring.
        As you examine the ring, you notice Caramon close his eyes and
appear to concentrate on something.... or perhaps someone........

paper rules~
a set of rules~
A set of rules, governing the behavior of immortals has been dropped here.~
              Rules for Immortal Player Behaviour

Upon becoming immortal, you are no longer considered a player in DikuMud,
you simply cannot get killed. Therefore, there are certain rules you must
follow. Knowingly breaking these rules will probably cost you your
characters(s).

 - An immortal must not support ANY mortal playing character in the game,
   including his/her own caracter. Supporting includes grouping, items,
   money, 'preparing' monsters for easy killing, etc.
      You may occasionally help low-level players by giving them
   small amounts of money or items. You may only give them what is
   buyable in the shops, and never more than 500 gold coins worth.
      Immortals are welcome to take part in the game, by creating
   unexpected (but never unreasonably harmful) obstacles for the players,
   or by providing divine assistance to a newcomer in distress. Usage
   of the 'switch'-command to make the monsters more challenging or
   entertaining is also acceptable - see the rules about harming players,
   below.

 - An immortal is allowed to play other characters, provided that he/she
   does not support them - see above. Beware: It is very hard not to help
   your mortal player, and we'll show virtually no mercy, should we find out.
     Exception from this rule can be made ONLY for test purposes, and only
   by immortals who are actually building or supervising areas of the
   world. Other players should NEVER benefit or suffer from this.
   Test characters should not be a nuisance to other players in any way.

 - An immortal character is not allowed to harm mortal players
   in any way, unless this player is extremly provocative and
   annoying to others.

   Any action taken against mortals should have a VERY good reason.

 - Implementors of DikuMUD reserves right to change any of the
   above rules.

 - A frequently asked question is what to do after a game crash. In general,
   you shouldn't do anything. However, if you feel up to it, and if you
   feel very confident that you aren't being cheated (grabbed by the nose,
   as they say in Denmark), you are allowed to make compensations for the
   losses of the players. Still, the rule in this case is, 'better too
   little than too much'.
