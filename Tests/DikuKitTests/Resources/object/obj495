  So one day I was walking through the 100 Acre Woods. I noticed
  that the place was pretty empty except for this little boy's 
  house. So, I knocked on the door and found the little boy,
  Christopher Robin. He invited me to explore the woods with him.
  We headed out of his yard and down the path. Soon we found a 
  stream and a bridge. I fell in the stream and landed somewhere 
  in the middle of the woods. Christoper was not sure how to get 
  back so we stopped and asked Eeyore. He was SO gloomy and 
  suggested we check with Owl. Owl rambled on and on, Christopher 
  nodded as if he knew what the owl was talking about.  Kangaroos, 
  rabbits, tiggers, woozles and strange things called Heffalumps 
  did not make any sense to me. So, I just went along with it. 
  No one was very cooperative. We had to protect ourselves and kill
  a few others along the way. Yet, we made it out alive and managed
  to pick up a few treasures along the way! I found a nice set of 
  tigger springs, balloons, a cool red shirt and a handmade quilt! 
  Why did I not see any of you there? Grab a few friends and 
  drop in on the Robins. I am sure they would love to see you!
