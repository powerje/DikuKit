                 | TOURNAQUEST PROCEDURE |
                  -----------------------{bo}

{C}All quest participants will be given a level 1 Avatar to start
off with on the testMUD. The name, race and first/second class
of the Avatar  will be chosen by the  participant prior to the
character's creation  by the immortal or immortals hosting the
tournaquest.  All quest characters will be clubless and have a
PK flag for the duration of the week and all participants will
take whatever time they decide to commit to levelling, zoning,
PKing or whatever else with their Avatar.  This will go on for
one week, after which a tournament will be set up to determine
the overall tournaquest champion.

All normal MUD rules apply. Only one Avatar per player will be
allowed, all of which will be given a newbie set of equipment.{bo}

              -----------------{bo,C}

The overall goal of the tournaquest is to have
fun. You may form alliances (or, just as well,
you may make a few enemies along the way), and
they don't necessarily need to be with players
that are normally in your own club.  Just keep
in mind that they are all temporary, seeing as
in the end there can be only one!{bo}

             | PRIZES/BONUSES |
              ----------------{bo,C}

After all is said and done, all participants
will be allowed to transfer their tournaquest
Avatars over to the real MUD where they will
be able to do with them as they please. There
will be a little something extra for whoever
wins the tournament, which won't be revealed
until the very end.{bo}

              ------------------{bo,C}

To join in on the fun, simply mudmail Infinite
with the preferred character name, race, first
and second class of your quest Avatar. Be sure
to clarify which character the password should
be mailed to when the quest begins  if not the
same one mudmailing  at the time.  At midnight
EST on Monday, April 24th,  all passwords will
be mudmailed  to the participants and any time
after that players can start on their quest.

Please direct any further questions to Infinite.{bo}
