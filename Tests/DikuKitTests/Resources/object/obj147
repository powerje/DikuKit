This is one LONG line!  In fact, you can't even see where the line ends.
Yet oddly enough, when you pick it up, it seems solid.  However, no
matter how you wave it about, the other end always manages to remain
out of your sight.  This thing totally defies all logic and reality.

the fust and you are left with a perfectly good and hard thick glass that's
big enough to fit your feet in!  This may be somewhat unorthodox, but

    Keep this in mind:
    Each wire (live, that is) uses some electricity.
    No wire (dead, that is) uses us.
    All wires (live or dead) uses up metal.
    Rolling your eyes in disgust, you slam the book shut.  What
a waste of your time.  And whoever actually found this information
