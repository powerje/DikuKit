            MIDGAARD NEWS
   August 30, 1989
 
   TACO-EATING CONTEST GOES AWRY - POOR VENTILATION TO BLAME.
 
   (MP) - A recent taco-eating contest in Midgaard turned to 
   disaster today, after a poorly installed ventilation system 
   purged gases from the competition into a neighboring building,
   The Midgaard Arcade.  All in the building are reportedly dead.
 
   "It happened so fast," reports Deputy DREDD, from the Midgaard
   Police Department. "Apparently, the taco meat was not prepared
   properly, and the end result to the digestive tracts caused a
   massive gas burst to flood the nearby building."
 
   Police are investigating the scene of the incident. The Midgaard
   Arcade has been closed until further notice and decontamination.  
   Authorities are also seeking a suspect by the name of Loco, for 
   questioning regarding his role in the incident.

{W,BO}The Rules:
   1. Saccing the Potato is Elton John Gay.
   2. No handing it to the Zone Leader, anyone else is fair game.
   3. No handing it to a mob so that some sucker auto-loots it;
      It's ok to do it to someone who's levelling though.
   4. Giving it to a non-participant is Drop-the-soap-in-prison GAY.
   5. Logging another person's character to give it to, or to mess
      with their toggle, is Backstreet Boys gay.
   6. Handing it to a naked character is I-collect-Barbara-
      Streisand-albums GHEY.
   7. Handing it to an immortal is not only gay, but proves to
      us that you rode the little school bus back in school.
   8. Losing the potato makes you the most ultra-mega-hyper-
      youcannameallthemylittleponydolls-gay that ever was gay.
