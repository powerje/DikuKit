The parchment looks quiet worn, you can barely make out the words on it.
It appears to be a notice about The Tull Town Festival. The date has been
smeared but the directions to the town are to go north at The Intersection
east of Midgaard, then follow the path. Somewhere along the base of Mount
Sepher is road leading west to Tull. You can also see that the word 'Cancelled'
has been written in big red letters across the page.
You begin to wonder about this town, what kind of people if any are
there, and do they need to be rid of any strange daemons, spirits, or evil
Warlocks? If you are a true Avatar then perhaps you should get a buddy 
or two and go explore this place.

The tree is a 15 foot tall evergreen. It is covered with pretty velvet
red bows and has small white candles spaced out evenly on the branches. A
beautiful angel sits atop the tree. The scent of pine fills the air 
and you are reminded of singing caroles and drinking hot chocolate in
front of a warm fireplace. There are bright colorful candy canes hanging
on the tree. Go ahead.... take one:)
