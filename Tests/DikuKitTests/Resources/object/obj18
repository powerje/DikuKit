Congratulations! You have found a unique and rather unusually powerful weapon
due to the fact that it can be used at any level.  It amazes me further
  that you took an opportunity to even read this description!  Good job,
  and enjoy your new propellor.  -Zoharn

scroll note divine~
{CY}{BO}For as long as anyone can remember, this land has been ruled by the GODS.
Both good and evil have prevailed upon the land and tyranny ruled alongside.

Change is in the air as the world has grown unsettled and the GODS have lost their
ability to rule. The land seems to be splitting into new kingdoms and taking shape
into a new world... the same... different. It appears these lands could be in dire
need of direction and leadership. A king is needed to rule and bring prosperity
to these new kingdoms. Order is needed and a true leader is being summoned. Only
he who is strong at heart and wise beyond words should attempt to be king. The GODS
should be satisfied with such a king or else the lands could become even more
unsettled.

Those who call this world home should stand up and choose a king to rule. Be aware
though, new lands will form and new kings will arise. Expect new cities to emerge
in the midst of new rule. The time has come and the time is now!
