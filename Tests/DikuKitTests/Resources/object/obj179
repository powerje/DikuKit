This is the ring that Emperor Prosek of the Coalition uses to stamp imperial
edicts and such.  With this, you can RULE the Coalition.  (Of course, unless
you murdered Prosek, in which case the Coalition is manhunting for you.)

This is a life size marble statue of Dee and the love of his life, Rebekah...

Dee the Poet is gently, yet firmly, holding Rebekah close, with his arms
wrapped around her in loving embrace.  You just KNOW that to Dee, there is 
none fairer, or more beautiful, in all the vastness of creation than his
Rebekah.  The spark alone, in Dee's eyes as he gazes at his love, makes you
jealous.  You can only dream of finding such a love for yourself...

An inscription reads, "For my true love Rebekah...thank you for being who you
are and for all the beauty you bring to my weary heart.  Thank you for giving
me the strength to be a man.  Most important of all, thank you for bringing
me closer to our Lord, Jesus Christ...  I love you, and I love you more with
each passing moment...

Yours, and your only my sweet love Rebekah, until the day I can no longer
draw breath into my lungs...          -- David Lee Yun"
