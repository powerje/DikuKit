Hickey~

     What a bright and nasty looking mark on your neck!
You wonder who might have put it there. Obviously it was
done in the heat of passion. As you look at the hickey you
wonder what animal the owner of this hickey has been playing
with. The thought of the passion involved in creating this 
monster hickey must have been intense. You are a bit jealous.

Tanto Blade~

     You hold in your hand a weapon of pure evil.
This tanto, Soul Taker, was created in the forges
of hell for an evil Shogun warlord who had lost his
honour. He drew upon the forces of darkness and
lost his soul. The power of Soul Taker is awesome.
Its evil has laid waste to lands and struck whole
armies down before its terrible rage. Once wielded
you to will lose you soul and the forces of the 
evil ancients will consume you. Act fast for the 
power of Soul Taker is fleeting as no one being
can ever satisfy its terrbile hunger. As death and
dishonour approach remember that once you have chosen
the dark path there is no way back into the light.

Wedding ring~

     This is a finely crafted diamond ring.
The attention to detail is incredible and 
you are amazed at the size of the diamond 
set into the gold band. If you look closely
you can see an inscription.
 "To Anneliese...From your Blockhead."
