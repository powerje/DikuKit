final~

   {BO,MAG}A troop of Winged Monkeys have captured and carried me 
   to the castle of the Wicked Witch. Unable to harness  
   the power of the Ruby Sneakers, the Wicked Witch has 
   enslaved me in her dungeon with plans to starve me. My 
   life has become very sad as I have grown to understand that 
   it will be harder than ever to get back to Kansas and Aunt 
   Em again. This may be my last diary entry. If anyone reads 
   this, tell my family I love them.     

   -Dorothy Gale{b}

   {BO,MAG}There were only four witches in all the Land of Oz, and 
   two of them, those who live in the North and the South, are 
   good witches. Those who dwelt in the East and the West 
   were wicked witches. But now that one has been killed, 
   there is but one wicked witch in all the Land of Oz--the 
   Wicked Witch of the West.

   Oz himself is a Great Wizard. He is more powerful than all the 
   rest of those together. He lives in the City of Emeralds.  

   I've learned at the East, not far from here, there is a great 
   desert. None could live to cross it. To the South is the country of 
   the Quadlings. Another great desert reaches to the West. That is 
   the country where the Winkies live. It is ruled by the Wicked 
   Witch of the West, who will make us her slave if we pass her 
   way. The City of Emeralds is to the North, the path paved with 
   yellow brick. I must reach Oz and tell him my story and ask him 
   for help.{b}

   {BO,MAG}There was one of porcelain girls who was so beautiful
   that the woodsman grew to love her with all his heart. She, 
   on her part, promised to marry him as soon as he could earn 
   enough money to build a better house for herself; so the 
   tinman set to work harder than ever. But the girl lived with 
   an old woman who did not want her to marry anyone, for 
   she was so lazy she wished the girl to remain with her and 
   do the cooking and the housework. So the old woman went 
   to the Wicked Witch of the East, and promised her two 
   sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage. 
   Thereupon the Wicked Witch enchanted the woodman's
   axe, and when he was chopping away at his best one day, 
   for he was anxious to get the new house and his wife as 
   soon as possible, the axe slipped all at once and cut off his 
   left leg. 

   This at first seemed a great misfortune, for he knew a one-
   legged man could not do very well as a wood-chopper. So 
   he went to a tinsmith and had him make a new leg out of 
   tin. The leg worked very well, once he was used to it. But 
   his action angered the Wicked Witch of the East, for she 
   had promised the old woman he would not marry the pretty  
   porcelain girl. When the woodsman began chopping again, 
   his axe slipped and cut off his right leg. Again he went to 
   {BO,MAG}the tinsmith, and again he made him a leg out of tin. After 
   this, the enchanted axe cut off his arms, one after the other; 
   but, nothing daunted, he had them replaced with tin ones. 
   The Wicked Witch then made the axe slip and cut off his 
   head, and at first he thought that was the end. But the 
   tinsmith happened to come along, and he made him a new 
   head out of tin.

   He thought he had beaten the Wicked Witch then, and he 
   worked harder than ever; but he little knew how cruel his 
   enemy could be. She thought of a new way to kill his love for 
   the beautiful china maiden, and made his axe slip again, so 
   that it cut right through his body, splitting him into two halves. 
   Once more the tinsmith came to his help and made him a body 
   of tin, fastening his tin arms and legs and head to it, by means 
   of joints, so that he could move around as well as ever. But, 
   alas! He had now no heart, so that he lost all his love for the 
   porcelain girl, and did not care whether he married her or not. I 
   suppose she is still waiting for the woodsman to come to her.

   The woodsman once said to me, "The greatest loss I have ever 
   known was the loss of my heart. While I was in love, I was the 
   happiest man on earth; but no one can love who has not a 
   heart, and so I am resolved to ask Oz to give me one. If he does, 
   {BO,MAG}I will surely go back to the china maiden and marry her."{b}

   {BO,MAG}They say he sits day after day in the great Throne Room of 
   his Palace, and even those who wait upon him do not see 
   him face to face.

   It's hard to tell what he is like. You see, Oz is a Great 
   Wizard, and can take on any form he wishes. So that some 
   say he looks like a bird; some say he looks like an elephant; 
   some say he looks like a cat. To others he appears as a 
   beautiful fairy, a horrible monster, or in any other form that 
   pleases him. But who the real Oz is, when he is in his own 
   form, no living person can tell.

   {BO,MAG}Once the winged monkeys were a free people, living 
   happily in the great forest, flying from tree to tree, eating 
   nuts and fruit, and doing just as they pleased without 
   calling anyone master. Perhaps some of them were rather 
   too full of mischief at times, flying down to pull the tails of 
   the animals that had no wings, chasing birds, and throwing 
   nuts at the people who walked in the forest. But they were 
   careless and happy and full of fun, and enjoyed every 
   minute of the day. This was many years ago, long before 
   Oz came out of the clouds to rule over this land. 

   There lived here then, away at the North, a beautiful 
   princess, who was also a powerful sorceress. All her magic  
   was used to help the people, and she was never known to 
   hurt anyone who was good. Her name was Gayelette, and 
   she lived in a handsome palace built from great blocks of 
   ruby. Everyone loved her, but her greatest sorrow was that 
   she could find no one to love in return, since all the men 
   were much too stupid and ugly to mate with one so 
   beautiful and wise. At last, however, she found a boy who  
   was handsome and manly and wise beyond his years. 
   Gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man 
   she would make him her husband, so she took him to her 
   ruby palace and used her magic. 

   {BO,MAG}Nikko's grandfather Xigo was at that time the King of the 
   Winged Monkeys. Xigo lived in the forest near Gayelette's 
   palace, and the old fellow loved a joke better than a good 
   dinner. One day, just before the wedding, Xigo was flying 
   out with his band when he saw Quelala walking beside the 
   river. He was dressed in a rich costume of pink silk and 
   purple velvet, and Xigo thought he would see what he could 
   do. At his word the band flew down and seized Quelala, 
   carried him in their arms until they were over the middle of 
   the river, and then dropped him into the water. 

   "Swim out, my fine fellow," cried Xigo, "and see if the 
   water has spotted your clothes." Quelala was much too 
   wise not to swim, and he was not in the least spoiled by all 
   his good fortune. He laughed, when he came to the top of 
   the water, and swam in to shore. But when Gayelette came 
   running out to him she found his silks and velvet all ruined 
   by the river.

   The princess was angry, and she knew, of course, who did 
   it. She had all the Winged Monkeys brought before her, and 
   she said at first that their wings should be tied and they 
   should be treated as they had treated Quelala, and dropped 
   in the river. But Xigo pleaded hard, for he knew the 
   {BO,MAG}Monkeys would drown in the river with their wings tied, 
   and Quelala said a kind word for them also; so that 
   Gayelette finally spared them, on condition that the Winged 
   Monkeys should ever after do three times the bidding of the 
   owner of the Golden Cap. This Cap had been made for a 
   wedding present to Quelala, and it is said to have cost the 
   princess half her kingdom. Of course Xigo and all the other 
   monkeys at once agreed to the condition, and that is how it 
   happens that the winged monkeys are three times the slaves 
   of the owner of the Golden Cap, whosoever he may be."

   {BO,MAG}Quelala, being the first owner of the Golden Cap, was the 
   first to lay his wishes upon them. As his bride could not 
   bear the sight, he called the Winged Monkeys all to him in 
   the forest after he had married her and ordered them always 
   to keep where she could never again set eyes on them.  
   This was all the Winged Monkeys ever had to do until the 
   Golden Cap fell into the hands of the Wicked Witch of the 
   West, who made them enslave the Winkies, and afterward 
   drive Oz himself out of the Land of the West.  {b}

   {BO,MAG}The road to the south is said to be full of dangers to travelers. 
   There are wild beasts in the woods and a race of odd men who 
   do not like strangers to cross their country. For this reason, 
   none of the Quadlings ever venture north to the Emerald City.

   In spite of dangers, the best thing I can do is to travel to the  
   Land of the South and ask Glinda to help me. {b}
