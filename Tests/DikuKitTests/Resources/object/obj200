Memorial Statue Ganja~

  {BO,CY}Here stands a marble statue of the great NC gamer Ganja, whose 
knowledge, skill, and heart saw him do things no one else before or since 
has ever been able to do.  This is just a small testament to a good
friend, and tough mentor who pushed those he taught to the next level of 
greatness.

Ganja, you will be sorely missed.  May God watch you forever more.

With Love,

From Serenity and all us here on Northern Crossroads.{bo,WH}

  {R}The knights of the {G,BO}Underworld {bo,R}are just that, knights.  They are
  honorable, loyal, trustworthy and humble.  But they are also something more.
  They are also mysterious, and often the unsung and unknown heroes and heroines
  of the crossroads.  They arrive when people least expect it, do what must be
  done and then depart before most people even know what happened.  This pin
  is a tribute to all those men and women who serve the mysterious underworld
  and fight for they themselves, and their leaders set aside as right.{r}
