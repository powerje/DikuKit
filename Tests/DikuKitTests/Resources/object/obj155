 {W,BO}
  The Greenwood Mall is now open and ready
  for business. If you are a strong and 
  experienced shopper, we invite you to 
  participate in our Grand Opening. This
  is not for the novice. Also, we recommend
  that you bring friends when you shop. A
  team effort almost always prevents problems.
  Another thing to be aware of is our janitorial
  staff. They have a tendency to lose the lost
  and found items. The Mall is quite large and
  contains challenges for single advanced 
  characters as well as mid to high level groups.
  Also, be wary of security guards. They are
  overzealous sometimes. The Mall is outside the
  east gate of Midgaard and south below the 
  town. Have fun, and good luck!
