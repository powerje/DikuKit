Crystal Light Shining~


This shard of crystal was chipped off of a mysterious rock
said to have mystical powers, and then polished. It was
placed at the center of a personalized training dummy, and
provided that dummy with an almost life-like ability to
fight. As you hold it, a brilliant flash of light emerges from
the crystal, flooding your body with power.

This is the belt worn by Feyd-Rautha whenever he faught
against gladiators or enemies. There is a secret needle
hidden in the belt that can be released in times of dire need.
Feyd attempted to use this needle in his battle against
Paun Atreides, but it was ultimately his downfall when the
needle wedged into the floor, allowing Paul to finish him.

{R,BO}  Akatosh{BLA,BO}, known as{R,BO} Auri-El {BLA}to the {R}Aldmer {BLA}and {R}Bormahu {BLA}to the
{BLA,BO}  dragons, is the chief deity of the {BLU,BO}Nine Divines{BLA}. He is present in
{BLA,BO}  every {R}Tamrielic {BLA}religion except that of the {R,BO}Dunmer{BLA}. His avatar is
{BLA,BO}  a dragon, and he is often called the {R}Dragon God of Time{BLA}. He is
{BLA,BO}  generally considered to be the first of the Gods to form in the
{BLA,BO}  Beginning Place; after his establishment, other spirits found the
{BLA,BO}  process of being easier and the various pantheons of the world
{BLA,BO}  emerged. The{R} Aedric spirit {BLA}is the ultimate God of the{R} Cyrodiilic
{R,BO}  Empire{BLA}, where he embodies the qualities of endurance,
{BLA,BO}  invincibility, and everlasting legitimacy while promoting the
{BLA,BO}  virtues of duty, service, and obedience. {R,BO}Akatosh{BLA} is thought to be
{BLA,BO}  the father of all dragons, and their leader Alduin was titled
{BLA,BO}  "First-Born of {R}Akatosh{BLA}".{R} Akatosh{BLA} is the patron of {R}The Akatosh
{R,BO}  Chantry{BLA}, the religious order devoted to the worship and
{BLA,BO}  glorification of him, who refer to him as the {R}"Great Dragon"{BLA}. The
{BLA,BO}  Warp in the West and other {R}Dragon Breaks {BLA}are thought to result

Calling Boethiah~

{BLA,BO}  He is known in the Dunmer society for his association with
{BLA,BO}  Almalexia; the Tribunal Temple taught that he was her
{BLA,BO}  anticipation, while the New Temple preaches that he was reclaimed
{BLA,BO}  his right position. Heralded by the Prophet Veloth, Boethiah is
{BLA,BO}  the original god-ancestor of the Dark Elves. Through his
{BLA,BO}  illuminations, the eventual Chimer, or Changed Folk, renounced
{BLA,BO}  all ties to the Aldmer and founded a new nation based on Daedric
{BLA,BO}  principles. This worship of Boethiah supposedly came about when
{BLA,BO}  he corrupted the Elven God Trinimac and took on his form,
{BLA,BO}  tricking Veloth and his followers into worshipping him. All
{BLA,BO}  manner of Dark Elven cultural 'advances' are attributed to
{BLA,BO}  Boethiah, from philosophy to magic to 'responsible' architecture.
{BLA,BO}  Ancient Velothi allegories are foundation stories of Chimeri
{BLA,BO}  struggle where Boethiah uniformly succeeds against enemies of
{BLA,BO}  every type.{b}

{R}  Mephala sees the affairs of mortals as a weave; pull but one

{b}{R}  with more simple concepts - lies, sex, and murder. Mephala
{BLA,BO}  directly helped to found the infamous cult/society of the Morag
{b}{R}  Tong, and they claim to murder for the daedra's glory. Some
{BLA,BO}  scholars also argue that when the Morag Tong was banished from
{b}{R}  the rest of Tamriel, they were allowed to continue to operate in
{BLA,BO}  Morrowind when they replaced their worship of Mephala with that
{b}{R}  of Vivec. As a reaction to this, the {BLA,BO}Dark Brotherhood {b}{R}was formed,

{R,BO}  Dagon's acknowledged enemy is Ebonarm and his summoning day is
{R,BO}  Warriors Festival. As the Prince of Destruction and Revolution,
{R,BO}  Dagon is perhaps the most ambitious of the Daedric Princes, and
{R,BO}  has attempted to invade Nirn on several occasions. He assisted
{R,BO}  Jagar Tharn in his temporary procurement of the Imperial throne,
{R,BO}  probably in anticipation of the decade of warfare and strife
{R,BO}  Tharn's rule produced. He invaded and seized control of the
{R,BO}  Battlespire, in contravention of the Daedric pact limiting
{R,BO}  meddling in mortal affairs by divine beings, in order to cripple
{R,BO}  the capacity of the Imperial College of Battlemages. Dagon was
{R,BO}  also responsible for the destruction of Mournhold at the end of
{R,BO}  the First Era and apparently destroyed Ald Sotha, home of House
{R,BO}  Sotha and Sotha Sil's birthplace. Dagon was also the alleged
{R,BO}  inventor of the Daedric Crescent. The Broadsword of the Moon
{R,BO}  Reiver is an artifact created from Dagon's own substance and
{R,BO}  given to his Dark Seducer bodyguard, which was used against him
{R,BO}  by an unknown hero and resulted in the destruction of the
{R,BO}  Battlespire.{b}
