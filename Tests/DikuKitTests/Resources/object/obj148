     This is a little mark that MTV places on all their
     children to keep them in check.  The few that have
     succesfully seperated from MTV have noticed that
     they now have no life at all.  Be warned...{bo}

fountain water~
 
      {BO,C}This is your typical water fountain.  Tan shaded sides with a 
     silver top with water stains covering it.  The small vent slots
     emit a small humming sound common to most water fountains.  A round
     button has been stuck down to the top making the fountain send forth
     an endless spray of water.  It might be possible to fit your liquid
     container underneath the stream of water.  You might end up needing
     it for this journey of yours.{bo}

The materials used to construct this sigh were "borrowed" from a
research facility that no longer exists.  With these key ingredients
we have created the ultimate line of picketing products.  Though not
completely indestructable, "The Man" will have a hard time destroying
this bad boy.  Enjoy!
