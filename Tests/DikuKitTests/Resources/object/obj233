decorated in the same manner as the lobby. Leather couches adorn 3 sides of the
interior. You can hear faintly the soft melodies of Musak coming from inside along
with an almost hypnotic voice that says...

Welcome to Chronos-Japan Branch. For your convenience these automated elevators 
will bring you to the second floor security station where you will be issued the 
passes needed to get to your final destinations. Please stand clear of the doors
as they close and as always, Thank you for visiting Chronos Japan.

up and reveals an empty space behind it where you would expect your arm
to be. When you reach in you can almost fit your whole other arm in there.
It must be some kind of extra dimensional storage location.

heads that are slightly too large for the bodies. Others have massive shoulders

the apparently more secure areas. There is smoke coming from one corridor as
if there is a fire, and a small team of security apparently breaking up
what looks to be a fight in another hallway. It is hard to tell through

Note~

   This note looks like it was crumpled up and put into this guard's
pocket. It is covered with chocolate stains and marshmellow. It says...

{C}This is to remind you Jerry that you need to stick close to that diet
the doctor put you on. That especially means NO MORE GOING INTO THE SNACK
ROOM AT WORK! If you don't lose some weight the doctor doesn't know what
might happen to you in a few years. 

               I just say this because I love ya you big lug,

   You are looking at a beautiful sapphire ring. It looks
to be about a carat in total weight and the color is magnificent.
It is set into a solid gold band that looks to be about a
half and inch in thickness and would fit a somewhat large
finger. As you look closer at the stone you notice that there
is a dull pulsing light that seems to emanate from the very
core of the sapphire itself.

   There is a glowing orb of energy just hovering above the floor. As you

object is the physical manifestation of all that is good in the world. It
is awe insipiring. It fills you with the confidence that you can do anything
that you set your mind to. You feel that as long as you have this radiance
with you that there is nothing that you cannot accomplish.

Upon close inspection, you can see what it was that the huge
creature was reaching for in the spreading ooze. There is a 
small silver metal object that appears to be completely
untouched by the acid that the monster used on it. You wonder
