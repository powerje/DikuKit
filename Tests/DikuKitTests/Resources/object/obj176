   Bases neutralize acid - this is a well known fact taught by many

   acid and you are happy to finally get a hold of a pair.  You notice
   that the outer plates glow with a green haze and suspect them to be
   covered by a strong alkaline substance. As you reach down to pick
   them up, a protective bubble forms around you. You feel calm and
   protected in this strong alkaline mist. You feel confident that these
   wonderful sleeves will protect you in battle as well.
