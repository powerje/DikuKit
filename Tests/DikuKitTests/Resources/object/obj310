help~
   
   One of the most useful resources for becoming familiar with NC's
commands is the NC help files.  The help files cover a broad range
of topics, from basic commands, to skill information, to rules and
other useful information. 
   
   {bo,W}help{bo}        - {C}Displays a list of basic help topics
   {W}help help{bo}   - {C}Provides additional information for using help
   
   {W}Help (topic){bo} is the syntax for finding information about any given
topic.  'help look' for instances gives the different syntax for
using the look command.  There are help files for nearly all commands,
so be sure to try it out whenever you need help.

manual handbook book~
   
Here in your hand you see a beautifully crafted book with decorative leather
protecting its outer surface.  A tarnished brass plate reads "{bo,W}LOOK INTRODUCTION{bo}"
and as you touch it, you can feel the source of knowledge pulsate in your 
hands. 
  
    Type: {W}LOOK INTRODUCTION{bo}

introduction~
   
  Welcome young adventurer. Within the pages of this handbook is the
knowledge you will need to be a great Warrior, cunning Thief, wise Mage
or holy Cleric. As a new player you will need to learn the same skills
and arts as our legendary heroes learned. May the immortals smile on you.

                        37 Reimbursals
                          
  If you die, and the mud crashes, save will not always save you.
Because this mud is an ever changing one, items are not always saved
that should be saved.  Gods have the ability to reimburse items to 
mortals that would prevent mortals from having to do many zones to get
their stuff back.  This honored command is only given to those people
whose equipment was not lost by their own fault.  By this, I mean that
the only condition for immortal reimbursals is when it is the mud's 
fault that you lost your equipment.  For further explanations, ask one
of the visible immortals.

               38 CONGRATULATIONS
 
   You have completed the +NC+ NEWBIE HANDBOOK.  It is full of wise and
useful information.  We would like to suggest that you hold this book
for a while as it will increase your wisdom and intelligence attributes.

                            36 CLUBS
 
  There are several types of clubs here on Northern Crossroads.  Most people
can join a club depending on their levels and skills. Type: CLUBS and you
will get a list of things you can do.  For example, type: CLUBS LIST to get
a list of the clubs here on the MUD.  In addition, you can type: HELP CLUBS
to find out more about clubs.  Clubs are cool because most clubhouses have
very helpful things in them. A lot of clubs have certain requirements for
people to join.  You can ask any club member what those requirements are.
To see which players are in which club type: Who -lcf.  It is a good idea to
wait a while before joining a club to see exactly which club you will fit
into.  Changing clubs after you have joined one is not always easy.  Former
friends could turn into arch-enemies.

                  35 IMMORTALS AND GODS
 
  Immortals and Gods are higher level beings who help run the mud.
These people were once players like yourself, but have advanced in
levels and experience to become Immortal. Type: who -lfc. This will
show you which immortals are on.  They are the ones with the [   ] next
to their names.   For example [Immortal] or [God]. Type: wizlist.
This will show you a list of all the immortals on the mud. These people
are here to help players with questions and problems. Feel free to ask
anyone of them for help.  Immortal levels are Immortal through Committee.
Committee are the actual coders of the mud.  You too can become an Immortal
someday if you have a desire to work hard and create an area of your own.

                   34 DONATIONS & SACRIFICING
 
  There is a Donation room located in town where players can donate
equipment for others. (2n,e) As you get more equipment through your many
adventures, you can donate some of your old stuff to others. To do this 
you type: Don (item).  This will automatically donate the item directly to
the donation room.  You do not have to be in the Donation room to donate.  
Please don't fill the donation room with useless items. If you want to get
rid of an item PERMANENTLY you can sacrifice it to the Gods.  Any item you
sacrifice will be GONE!! So be careful when you do this. You can sacrifice 
an item by typing:  Sac (item).  I had this dog once...
~
E
33~
                      33 MAIL
 
  You can write to other people who are not on the game by going
to the post office.  The post office is located in the city (refer to map).
You can write a message to someone or receive mail if someone has written
you a message.  This can be very useful if you need to relay a message to
another player who is not currently on. When you log onto the game you will
see a message on your screen telling you if you have mail or not.

~
E
32~
                  32 MESSAGE BOARDS
 
  There are several message boards located around the city.  This is where
important messages are posted.  These messages may be about anything from
rules to problems.  There is a message board directly north of the Temple
Square. Remember to check these boards on a regular basis.  You may post on
these boards anytime you have a comment or question or want to offer your 
opinions about a certain mud related subject.
~
E
31~
                      31 Alignment
 
  As you kill different types of mobs, your alignment will change.
If you kill Good mobs (like cityguards) you will become more and
more evil.  As you kill evil mobs (like fidos) you will become more and
more good.  To check your alignment type SCORE. Many types of equipment
require that you have a certain alignment to wear them.  You will need to
kill the proper types of mobs to change your alignment.  If a piece of eq.
"zaps" you, then your alignment is wrong.  Magic users and clerics have
the ability to change your alignment as well.
~
E
30~
                 30 Grouping with other Players
 
  One of the most enjoyable things at the Northern Crossroads is grouping.
This is when you and other players band together to fight or explore. When
you are low level, it is best to group with others so that you will not be 
killed as easily.  You can only group with people who are NO MORE or NO LESS
then 15 levels above or below you. Once you are part of a group, you will gain
experience as you kill mobs.  The experience you gain will be less then
if you killed the mob yourself, but your chances of dying are less and you
can kill harder mobs. Try to form a group with all four classes. To find a
group to join use the gossip channel. You simply type: gossip Does anyone
want to GROUP?????? Some players should respond to this request.  If no one
does then try again later.  Go to the newbie arena while you wait! 5 south and
up from market square.

~
E
29~
                       29 ALIAS
 
  An alias is a way to replace a long command into a word or letters.
For example, you can make an Alias to make you drink out of your barrel.
Type: alias com dr drink barrel. Now when you type dr you will automatically
drink from your barrel.  Type Help Alias to see added information on this
subject.

~
E
28~
                        28 RECALLING
 
  During battle or when you want to return to the temple in town you can
use a scroll of recall.  Buy scrolls at the magic shop in town. To use it
type RECITE SCROLL.  This will automatically transfer you back to town.
This is useful if you are lost or if you need to escape during a battle.
Remember that you must have the scroll in your inventory in order to use it.
You cannot use it if it's in a container or a bag of some sort. You DO NOT
need to first hold the scroll to use it.
{w}
   Recently, a player who has been exceptionally reliable with newbies has
been a person called Dax.  This player has the ability to summon you back
to the training room one room above market.  If you get in a sticky situation
or get lost, type gos dax summon and providing he/she is on, they will summon
you to her place.  She will also cast spells on you.  Type dax spells to see
what she is offering.

~
E
27~
                    27 Renting and Quitting
 
  If you want to stop playing, you need to go to the Hotel (in town) and
rent.  It will cost you a certain amount of gold to save your eq. When you
get to the hotel you first type: OFFER to see how much it will cost you to
rent.  Then type: RENT to save your character and eq.  If you do not have
enough gold to rent, GOSSIP and ask for help, and someone will help you with rent.
You can also stop playing by typing Quit.  If you do this you will loose all
your equipment so be careful when you use this command.  You could loose some
pretty cool pieces.
~
E
26~
                      26 SAVING
 
  Occasionally, the mud crashes.  Remember to type SAVE often.
You should type save after every few kills or if you get a piece of
new eq. Get used to typing save, in case of a crash.  The mud will 
automatically save your game every 2 minutes or so BUT don't take
the chance of loosing a cool new piece you have acquired.
~
E
25~
                    25 ENERGY and MOVEMENT
 
  Sometimes your energy level and movement will run out.  This may happen
because you have walked too much, if you are wearing a piece of eq which
drains your energy, or if one of your spells runs out.  If this happens
you can do one of two things.  1) REST or SLEEP until your energy returns or
2) Eat something.  This should give you most of your movement back.
~
E
24~
                    24 Resting & Sleeping
 
  Another way you can regenerate your hitpoints is to rest or sleep
after battles.  This will also regenerate your mana and movement
potentials. As you run out of mana, hitpoints, or movement type REST or
SLEEP and your points will regenerate. You will have faster regeneration
if you are resting in the Mallins. The Mallins is located under Market
Square.  If the door to the Mallins is closed just type: OPEN Mausuleum.
Druids, who have mastered the art of healing have many spells that may
help you in your regeneration as well.  
~
E
23~
                       23 Healing
 
  When your are fighting Mobs, you will be loosing hitpoints when
you are hit.  If you are a cleric you can heal yourself during
combat. You can also heal others when you are fighting.  If you are
a class other then a cleric, you will have to use potions to heal
yourself.  You can go to the HEALER to buy potions to use in combat.
In order to use these potions just type: quaff (potion name).  Some
mobs around town may have these healing potions as well. 
~
E
22~
                    22 BAGS and CONTAINERS
  
  You will need to keep things you are carrying in bags or containers.
You can buy a bag from the general store in town.  You will also find
different types of containers in your adventures.  Different types of
containers will allow you to put different amounts of things in them.
In order to put something into a bag type: PUT (item name) BAG.  To take
something out type: GET (item name) BAG. If you are carrying multiple bags
you need to specify which bag number you wish to put the item in.  Type: 
PUT (item name) (number of bag).For example, type: PUT sword 2.bag.  In
order to get something from a bag type: GET sword 2.bag.  Also, a good
idea to decrease the amount of weight you carry (in midgets) is to put
all your stuff in one bag and hold it.  Then the weight will disappear.
~
E
21~
                  21 Eating and Drinking
 
  From time to time you will get hungry or thirsty. You can buy food at the 
Bakery in town and you can get water at the fountain in Market Square. You
can buy a barrel at the Bar by the Hotel in town. After you buy a barrel, 
type FILL BARREL FOUNTAIN.  When you are thirsty type: DRINK BARREL, and when 
you are hungry type: EAT (food name). Also, some equipment may carry mystical
properties that make hunger seemingly go away.  The most common of these pieces
is the towel.  Ask a higher advanced player for help in acquiring one.

                       20 Invisibility
 
  There are many things on NC which are invisible. Equipment, objects, and
even some players!  You will not be able to see these things if you don't
have some sort of detect invisibility spell, potion, or object. The simplest
way to see invisible objects and people is to go to the Magic Shop in town and
buy a Yellow Potion.  This will allow you to see invisible things for a
certain amount of time. If you are invisible and you try to buy something at
the shops, the shop keepers will not do business with you.  Maybe they should
quaff a yellow potion as well, eh?
~
E
19~
                19 EQUIPMENT REPAIR 
 
  You need to regularly repair your eq. If you don't it will disintegrate
after heavy use. To repair your eq, go to the smithy and type repair all. We
can not emphasize this enough. DO THIS OFTEN!!! Remember it costs money to fix
your stuff so have money ready before you repair.
~
E
18~
                       18 EQUIPMENT
 
  A full inventory of eq. consists of 18 items worn, held, or wielded.
Good equipment is a vital part of the game.  Some eq. will improve your
armor class, mana, movement, or hitpoints. Most pieces give some type of 
affect.  To find out what a piece of eq. does, use a scroll of identify on it. 
Some eq. is aligned so you must be evil, neutral, or good to wear or use it.  
Your alignment changes as you kill certain types of monsters (or MOBS).  If 
you kill good mobs you will become evil, if you kill evil mobs you will become 
good.
~
E
17~
                            17 LEVELING
 
 You advance in level by gaining experience.  You gain experience by killing
mobs.  When you start your character you chose a class.  This is a dual class
mud.  At level 15 you are allowed to chose a 2nd class. To do this you will
go to Paladins Temple and Pray for your 2nd class.  Any higher level player
can show you where to go. At level 50/50 dual go to one of the trainers for 
blademaster, assassin, druid, or archmage.  The highest level you can be as 
a mortal is 50 ADVANCED. Remember to keep your CON and WIS as high as possible
when you level, this will gain you the maximum hitpoints and practices. Increased
stats are important to ADVANCED classes but you must discover which ones. Duals
level at Bozo up from Market Square.  Advanced players advance automatically, 
however, to learn new skills these players must go to their trainers.  These 
trainers are hidden and must be found.

  Type: SHOWEXIT        This will make it so you automatically see the
exits in a room. You can also type: EXIT or EX to see a room's exits. This
command will NOT show secret or hidden exits. 

  There are many SECRET EXITS and HIDDEN DOORS. Often something good
is behind these doors. When you are in a room try going in all directions
NOT listed when you type: exit. If there is a hidden route you will find it.
You must also read the room descriptions very carefully for clues. 

  Type: auto     This allows you to see the auto functions that are available.

11 Fleeing
{w} 
  When you are in combat and you want to stop fighting, you can type:
FLEE to run away from your enemy.  Fleeing may not always work so
remember to type flee early (before you loose all your hit points).
You will lose some experience when you flee but it will be less than if 
you die.
{w} 
  In case you are not able to flee, you may (if you are fast enough) try
to use a Scroll of Recall (which you can purchase at the magic shop).  You
do not have to hold the Scroll of Recall in order to use it.  You do need to 
have it in your inventory (not in a container or bag). Some mobs will be able 
to destroy your scroll in battle so be careful. type: RECITE RECALL
  Also, when (and if you choose to) join a club, you may use your insignia
as long as you are not already engaged in a fight.
{w}
~
E
12~
                         12 Wimpy
 
  A good idea is to set your Wimpy.  Wimpy will automatically make you
flee in battle when you reach a certain hit point.  For example, if you
have 20 hit points total and you want to flee from you opponent when you
reach 10 hit points you would type :  WIMPY 10.  Remember that when you
flee from an opponent after you are engaged in a battle, you will loose 
some experience points.

13~
                        13  DYING!!!
    
  On your many adventures to come, you will SURELY die while doing battle.
Don't worry, death is part of life. When you die you re-enter the game.
Once you do, the first thing you must do is GO GET YOUR STUFF BACK!!! Most
likely you will not be able to do it without the help of a high level player.
So ASK someone to HELP you. When you die you lose 1 point of con, if your
con gets to 0 you will go back to level 1. So after every death make sure you train
your con back up.
   
This is important because YOUR Equipment is YOUR LIFE!!!! DONT LOSE IT.   
~
E
14~
                        14 DEATH TRAPS
 
  In your many explorations you will probably run into a DEATH TRAP.
When you hit a DT you will DIE and LOOSE ALL YOUR EQ.  There will be NO
reimbursements for lost eq in a DT. Most of the DT's will kill you
instantly, but some will allow you to fly over them thus avoiding death. 
You must be wearing eq which allows you to fly or have a fly spell cast on 
you. One way you can detect DT's is by using a thief's PEEK ability.  Simply 
peek to the direction you wish to go. Peek more than once in case you fail!!
THIS IS A GOOD REASON TO GROUP.  Remember when you are in a new area, peek 
first before entering into a room.  
{w}
  You CAN get your equipment though, now!  There is a zone called the 
TIMEQUEST.  For more details, type help timequest.
{w}
~
E
15~
                         15  EXAMINE CORPSES
 
  After you kill a mob, you will want to look to see what the mob is
carrying. To do this, type: EXAMINE CORPSE (exa corpse).  This will show
you all eq the corpse has. To take something from the corpse you type:
GET (item) CORPSE.  You can also type: GET ALL CORPSE to take everyting.
If you want to drop something you took, type: DROP (item name). If there is
more then one corpse in the room type: Examine (corpse number).
This is the same concept as getting things from multiple bags in your inv.
~
E
16~
                     16 SPELLS
 
  Mage and Cleric's will have the ability to cast spells. Casting spells
will cost you mana (the amount of mana depends on the spell).  To find out 
what spells you have type: PRACTICE or (pra).  To see a list of the spells 
available type: SPELLS.  To get a description on a certain spell, type: Help 
(spell name). You must go to your guild to train your spells. To use your 
spells type: Cast '(spell name)' (mob's name) or cast '(spell name)' mob
to cast the spell on the first mob (creature) in the room.  Be careful when 
you use this because you can accidently cast a spell on a mob that will 
Destroy you. Also, if a mob happens to wander into the room and you press 
return, you will cast the spell on that mob.
 
  Example :  Cast 'chill touch' doggie  (always include ' when casting)
             Cast 'cure light' (self)
~
E
05~
05 Communicating
  There are several ways to communicate with others. The simplest
way is to type: say <your message> or you can use (') on place of
the word say. 
  SAY - speaks to everyone in the same room you are in
  TELL - only the person you send the tell to sees this (example: tell forge hi)
  SHOUT - everyone on the mud hears this, only use in emergencies
  GOSSIP(gos) - general communication mud wide(want to talk to everyone? use gos)
  type: help channels    for additional channels and their uses.

                    09  Stats
 
  Stats are very important here.  Stats are your Dex, Wis, Int, Con, and Str.
You want keep these stats as high as possible.  Check your stats by typing att
or use a scroll of improved identify. Lower levels must use the scroll.  As your
levels increase, stats will begin to appear on your attribute command. You can 
increase your stats at the same place you level. There is equipment which you can
get that increase certain stats when you use it. Use scrolls on equipment to find
out stats.

                             10 Skills
    
  Type: Help Skills.  This lists all the skills available to Warriors and
Thieves and at what level you will be able to learn that skill. Once you
learn a skill you use it by typing: (Skill name) (Mob name). For example,
a thief would type: BACKSTAB Doggie.  Skills are learned at your class
guild. Refer to the upper map of Midgaard for the location of your guild.
Keep your Intelligence high when you practice your skills to cut down on
the number of practices needed to learn a new skill.  You will need practice
sessions to practice your skills and these are earned when you level.
