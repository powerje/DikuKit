  Letter Blocks- o49614 through o49639. The English Alphabet.
         You will need to count how many of each letter
         you will need to spell the words on your list.
         load those letters first. Then load additional
         letters. Keep in mind if you ONLY load the exact
         number of letters needed to spell the words on 
         the list NO ONE will win. LOAD EXTRA LETTERS!
         I suggest loading at least 4 sets of letters for
         words you chose.
{g}
  Quest Case- o49611 to hold all letter blocks.

  The Prize- Sometimes announcing the prize in advance on 
         the board is helpful in drumming up participation.
