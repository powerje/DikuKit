blaster bendak starkiller~

{R,BO}  This blaster belonged to Bendak Starkiller, a duelist 
{R,BO}  legendary on Taris. It is a highly adaptable weapon, and 
{R,BO}  is definitely of better quality than any standard issue 
{R,BO}  pistol.{b}

{R}  Severed {R,BO}ea{b}{R}rs decorate an {BLA,BO}obsidian cord{b}{R} meant to be fashioned
{R}  around the neck, dangling around the larynx and then just back
{R}  to the nape. Tarnished spl{R,BO}o{b}{R}tch{R,BO}e{b}{R}s of bl{R,BO}oo{b}{R}d r{R,BO}ee{b}{R}k of {G}gloom {R}and
{BLA,BO}  death{b}{R}, capturing the final aura permeated by the victims of
{R}  Ragnar's {R,BO}s{b}{R}l{R,BO}a{R,BO}u{b}{R}g{R,BO}h{b}{R}t{R,BO}e{b}{R}r. What energy that remains within the {R,BO}maimed
{R,BO}  ea{b}{R}rs serves to {G,BO}rejuvenate {b}{R}and add {R,BO}vitality {b}{R}to the wearer.
{R}  A dim, red glow reflects the night as it is taken, defiling it
{R}  into a much less {WH,BO}pure {b}{R}and {WH,BO}bright {b}{R}hue, and instead, replacing
{R}  it with one that you could associate with {BLA,BO}nightmares {R}and {R,BO}murder{b}{R}.
