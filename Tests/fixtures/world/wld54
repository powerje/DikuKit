The Golgotha~
{MAGENTA}
  You stand in what seems to be a burial ground,
  a place of agony and sacrifice.  Bleached skulls
  stare blankly up at you.  The golgotha is a bowl
  shaped indentation in the side of the mountain. 
  Evil radiates from the center where you see the
  remains of a campfire.

Under the Mountains~
{BLACK,BOLD}
  A tunnel has been carved in the rock wall.  You can
  hear the sounds of sluggish movement echoing on the
  walls and an old stale smell hangs in the damp air.
  The short hairs on the back of your neck stiffen as 
  you sense an evil presence.
