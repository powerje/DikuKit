The Plains~

  You are standing on the plains. This is a vast desolate place where the
  wind can howl undisturbed since nothing but you barrs its way. However you
  are not the first to wander here. Before you somebody has left a small path.
  The path looks rather bewildered and is not the kind of path to lead to
  anywhere significant or important but it seems to have made up its mind to
  enter the hills far away north.

The Lane~

  You are strolling along a pleasant, shady lane. The road is lined on both
  sides by tall, stately trees which lend the scene with a sense of quiet
  serenity. You can follow the road north or south.

The Turning Point~
  
  This is where the Midgaard Road turns north and
  away from the city. To the west, the road continues
  towards what looks like a fairly large city.  The
  mute sounds of city commotion reach your ears from 
  a distance stray dogs barking, children crying, and
  street salesmen shouting.  To the east, you can see
  the stately oaks and poplars of the holy grove.

City Entrance~
    
  You stand on the outskirts of a large city - Midgaard
  the capital of this land. The road leads east into the
  peace and quiet - and dangers - of the forest; and to
  the west it becomes the main street of the town
  surrounded by a confusion of shops, bars, and market 
  places.
