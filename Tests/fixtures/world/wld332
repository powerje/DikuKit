{Y}Yedo{y}~

    {CYAN,BO}Yedo is much easier to get around in than Osaka.
    The streets are lined in perfect angles to eachother. But
    not at right angles.  Toranaga designed this city himself
    and he specifically made all the roads point away from 
    the castle so siege would be difficult.

{Y}Main Street{y}~

    {CYAN,BO}These streets are very well kept up, the people
    who live here take pride in their city and respect
    it's "wa" or harmony.  They see litering the street
    or polluting in any way as disrupting the harmony
    of the entire city.

{Y}Entrance to an eta village{y}~

    {CYAN,BO}This place is digusting.  There's filth everywhere
    and the smell!  It's horrible.  even the people
    are a bit fatter and uglier than most of the 
    Japaneese that you've seen.  Maybe you don't want
    to be here.

{Y}Eta Village{y}~

    {CYAN,BO}Eta are the lowest class of Japan.  They're the
    scum that nobody wants, they don't even get names.
    When addressed it is simply "shopkeeper" or "cleaner"
    never a name like "Aenima".  But they've done something
    to become eta, ie: stealing from a samurai.  Once
    eta, always eta... forever.

{Y}In front of a strange house{y}~

    {CYAN,BO}This house is odd.  It's somewhat of a cross between
    a european style and a japaneese style.  All of the
    walls are made of the Japaneese cloth that all the houses
    in Japan are made of.  But wherever possible the builders
    had used concrete and wood.  Very strange design.

    {CYAN,BO}This house is a mess.  It REEKS of Sake and rot.
    there are a line of what you assume to be prostitutes
    in the corner.  But not classy prostitutes like
    Kiku.  These ones would be described as cheap whores.
    there are feathers stuck everywhere, vomit everywhere,
    you decide barbarians must live here.

    {CYAN,BO}AND YOU WERE RIGHT!  Barbarians do live here.  Only
    not the kind you thought.  The crew from the Erasmus is here
    playing with their whores and drinking from barrels of sake.
    You can account for everyone except Crooq, the Captian-General
    and the Pilot.  Where could they of gone?

{Y}Yedo Castle{y}~

    {CYAN,BO}The castle itself isn't very large compared to the
    European mamoths that you're used to seeing, but it is built
    solid, and you guess that the castle sustains about ten
    thousand samurai.  Still enough to take out your puny
    group.

    to poke your head around, you notice that ALL the rooms
    in this castle are perfectly square, and all the hallways
    make right angles, no curves in this place.
