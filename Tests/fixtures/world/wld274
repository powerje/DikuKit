{BLINK,YELLOW}<=>{blink,yellow}   Turning the corner of College and Mountain you come across  {BLINK,YELLOW}<=>{blink,yellow}
{BLINK,YELLOW}<=>{blink,yellow}   a building that looks something between an old barn and a   {BLINK,YELLOW}<=>{blink,yellow}
{BLINK,YELLOW}<=>{blink,yellow}   house built in the 60's.  The line stands out the doors     {BLINK,YELLOW}<=>{blink,yellow}
{BLINK,YELLOW}<=>{blink,yellow}   about 20 deep.  You can hear the slight thumps of the bass  {BLINK,YELLOW}<=>{blink,yellow}
{BLINK,YELLOW}<=>{blink,yellow}   coming out of the bar.  This looks like it might be fun!    {BLINK,YELLOW}<=>{blink,yellow}

Pushing through the crowd~
Man 'O Man!  This crowd is starting to get a little
rowdy! People are pushing to get to the bathroom. Of
course there is a line 20 deep of women, while the men's
line has about two people.  To the north is a stream of
people flowing from the main bar.

As you stroll around the massive fountain you have
to dodge the numerous people standing about.  The
street performers are all about.  You duck the pin
set from the juggler.  Stepping back, you avoid the
brilliant breath of the fire eater.  The noise around
the square is deafening as the children throw coins
into the fountain.

YOU ALMOST MADE IT!!

You reached the edge of the fountain but as you
looked up, you noticed a man wretching into the
not so clean water.  You were thoroughly disgusted
and couldn't take anymore.  You started to mimic
the man on the side and in little time your eq
was no more.

You sit in the slop wondering why the hell you are here?
This mess contains items ranging from bras hanging on lamps
to pictures of the orgy that occurred last night.  This
poor boy that lives here needs to get a life outside of the
mud.
