    The walls of this room are marred black and have many scratches 
    upon them. You look closer and notice the charcoaled color of 
    this room is the result of the walls being scorched... possibly 
    by flame? You can only wonder what sort of creature lives within 
    the confines of this dark tower. You decide to make your way 
    further up the spiral stairs.{b}

The Tower of Fallen~

    {BO}{B}A spiral staircase leads ever upwards into the endless darkness.

The Top of the Tower~

    {BO}{B}As your eyes adjust to the pitch darkness of this chamber at the top
    of the {BO}{REV}{B}Tower of the Fallen{b}, {BO}{B}the first thing you notice is the walls.
    The walls in this room, just like the rest are{b} {R}scorched{r} {BO}{B}black. Though
    for some reason it looks as if you've reached a dead end, and there
    is no other exit, except for the way you came. Around the landing of
    this room lies ashed debris. On the walls there are several{b} {C}portraits{c},
    {BO}{B}depicting different sorts of {G}magical{g} {BO}{B}creatures. As you gaze into the
    last painting a flash of {BO}{R}red{r} {BO}{B}draws your attention. Only now do you
    realize that your not alone in this room, for a huge{b} {R}Efreeti{r} {BOL}{B}has been
    watching your every move. Guess this answers your questions about the
    scorched walls, as its eyes {BO}{R}burn {BO}{Y}bright {BO}{B}as red sapphires and flames
    seem to come from his very being{b}.

You notice one of the portraits is hung funny, and doesnt seem to
be scorched like the other paintings hanging from the wall. This
particular painting shows of a Wizard, casting spells of sorts,
walking backwards around a flame of burning embers.

Realm of the Fallen One~

    {G}You walk through the portrait and are amazed at the immensity of this
    chamber. The ceiling is opened to the sky here, and it feels as if you
    could almost touch the clouds from this high up. You can feel a very
    strong, and vibrant magical energy flowing about the room. Suddenly,
    all the energy from inside the chamber shoots into the sky above. You
    now feel powerless as it appears your magical energies have been drained
    from your body. Then from the sky you watch as a beingdescends from above
    filled with pure magic. You shield yourself from the distorted energy
    flowing back into the room. A beautiful red-haired woman floats upon a
    cloud before you. Upon her shoulder is a flickering flame which seems to
    be alive? The sky then turns black as thunder and lightning wracks the
    sky. Angered by your presence, she demands to know why you have intruded
    upon her private sanctum.{g}

    like this before. Further up ahead you can see light pouring in
    from the outside. You strive to make a dash towards the end of

    are in is very similar to the other one you were just in, though more 
    extravagantly decorated. The room here has an open skylight, and rays 
    from the sun pour in from all directions. There are also no soldiers, 
    or creatures lurking about this part of the palace. This must be the 
    Sultan's private paradise.{c} {BO}{G}Statues of silver and gold, adorned with
    jewels, rest on pedestals in the center of the room. A soft spewing
    fountain of water pours off into a large bath, in the corner of the 
    room. All kinds of fruit trees are placed throughout the room as well. 
    You see rose peddles scattered about the room. To the north you spot 
    a faint sparkling light, your curiosity draws you closer{g}.

A Secret Chamber in Eternal Bliss~

    {BO}{M}It appears you have stumbled upon the {C}Sultan's secret harem chamber. This room
    is very small in size, and it's not as nicely decorated like the others you've
    seen about the palace. In the back of the chamber you spy a very {W}large{w} {Y}bed, {M}in
    the corner you see a shower like fountain. Along one side of the wall on ground
    there are large comfy pillows, {BO}{M}as well as a few paintings, hanging from the
    wall. On the opposite side, hanging upon the wall are what looks to be shackles,
    and by the looks of it, this wall can hold up to about 10 women at one time. As
    you inspect the room further, you discover a large lump underneath a pile of
    {W}sheets{w} {M}atop the bed. As you inch your way closer towards the bed, a young dark
    -haired, beautiful woman jumps out from beneath the sheets. She looks to be
    startled by your presence. Maybe you should speak with her, and try and comfort
    her in someway...{m}

    a large open window on the second level of the palace.{c} {BLU}As you 
    glance through the window you notice there are much fewer 
    {M}guards {BLU}in this area of the palace{blu}. {C}A strong breeze hits you 
    across the back, and you begin to feel very uncomfortable
    standing here{c}. {BO}{B}Its time you get moving if you are to find the 
    {C}Sultan {B}and rid him of the land{b}.

Crashing Through A Window!!~

    {R}You walk forward through the open windows, and tumble on to the floor
    below you. Ooops.. Not realizing the drop down from the window, you fall
    flat on your face, as you step off the platform and hit the floor with a
    loud thud. Doing so has caused the guards to take notice,as they begin to
    pour in the room by the camel load{r}.

Before the Chamber of Jafar~

    {Y}The chanting sound from within the room to the west is now much louder 
    then before. Peeking further west you spy a man tall and lanky in size, 
    dressed in robes of all black. {BO}{B}His very dark and sinister looking 
    appearance, causes you wonder what this man could possibly be doing in 
    this room. You watch as he scurries from one end of the room to the 
    other side. He looks to be collecting viles and pouring them into a 
    cauldron of {G}bubbling green liquid{g}.

    has been banished from lands afar. Now he has been summoned by the
    Sultan, to aid him in keeping rule, and driving fear through out the
    people and the land of Al-Qadim. It looks as if hes up to no good!!{b}

Before the Room of Appointments~

    {C}You now stand before a large granite doorway to the east,
    and a waiting room lies to the south. The only way your

    made an appointment, and have received a key to the door.
    Which in your case have neither an appointment nor a key.{c}

You are standing before two huge granite doors.
  These massive doors look very sturdy indeed. The
  only possible way of getting through them, is if
  you have been given a key. Did you forget yours?

    guests, along with loyal subjects awaiting an appointment to see 
    the Sultan. You rest for only a moment, as you do so a man in the
    corner of the room jumps up from his seat, and begins pacing about
    frantically, waving a key in one hand, while staring at the watch 
    around his wrist. It looks like he's been waiting a very long time{c}.

Office of the Dictator~

    {BO}{BLU}As you enter this huge office, you spot desks and book shelves strewn across
    the entire room, along with important documents scattered about the floor,
    as if a hurricane had torn through the room. Lights flickering and the smell 
    of perspiration guides your senses to see what horror is present in this 
    office. {B}As your eyes follow the trash and debris, you suddenly find yourself 
    staring at a middle-aged man, with a grumpy look to his face, swearing in 
    a language you cannot understand while looking over a map which is on a desk. 
    Suddenly he tears the map in two and {R}flames{r} {B}shoot from his eyes and burns 
    the paper to ash. Then realizing he is not the only one in the room he turns
    towards you, points his finger and says "{W}It's all your fault, {C}You must DIE!{B}"{b}

{C}Mute's {BO}{B}Chamber{b} {W}of {BO}{R}Horror{r}~
    
    {BO}{B}You are surpised to find yourself standing in the middle of a cemetery.
    A cold shiver of fear runs through your spine as you see some smashed
    tombstones scattered about the graveyard.
   
    What looks like four gangsta rappers rapping to some unknown lyrics are
    standing by a huge pile of bones. You can't help but bob your head to
    the beat as these thuggish ruggish niggaz do their thang. Then out from
    a dark cloud of smoke one of them pulls out an already blazed blunt. As
    they pass the blunt around, a dark figure suddenly comes into view. He
    drops a corpse and then takes a puff and relaxes. "Mute, you one crazy
    mutha fuckin badass thug nigga beeeitch!!!" A loud sinister laugh erupts
    from Mute as you see the faint light hit his face. It's Feeding time!!...
   
    They start to feed on the corpse as the bass drops and the rhymes continue{b}...
