{BO,BLACK}The Dragon Caves Of Melnibone{black}~

   {BO,BLACK}The Dragon Caves are Dark, and you can't see the top of the Cavern,
   giving the feel of an infinite abyss.  The waters are placid, and
   you can't hear anything over your own breathing.  The air is dead
   calm, and you feel that if you lose yourself in this maze of darkness,
   you might never escape from this cavern.{bo,black}
