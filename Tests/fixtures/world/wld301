On A Forest Path~

On a dimly light path, you sense that you are not alone. The path is not
very worn. It cannot be decided if it is well traveled or barely traveled.
This peeks your curiousity and you feel the urge to keep on wondering.

{M,BO}The Queen's Nest{b}~

{Y}  This dirt-filled room seems to be filled with various forms of
{Y}  scrap-food that the worker ants scrounged up. In the back wall of
{Y}  the room sitting elegantly in a throne made of hard sugar is the
{Y}  Queen ant. She seems quite bossy and arrogant as you watch her
{Y}  bossing all of her servants around. The instant she sees you, she
{Y}  orders her army to charge you as she attempts to flee the pile.{b}

{R}Descending into the Ant Pile{b}~

{Y}  You are surrounded by dirt and ferocious, terrorizing ants that
{Y}  seem to rip apart your armor with their razor sharp teeth. You
{Y}  try desperately to escape but realize that you seem to be in the
{Y}  clear so long as you can run by them fast enough, however. Their
{Y}  rather one-tracked minds seem to concentrate on finding food at
{Y}  the moment.{b}

{Y}The Ant Pile{b}~

{Y}  You stand before a large pile of sand that appears to be
{Y}  overflowing with an army of {R,BO}ants{b}{Y}. Thousands upon thousands of
{Y}  dark red {R,BO}ants {b}{Y}infiltrate this tiny hole that appears to be
{Y}  well-developed beneath the surface of the Earth. The {R,BO}ants {b}{Y}appear
{Y}  to be in various columns heading in various directions in search
{Y}  of food. However, you appear to not be the only one to observe
{Y}  the ants. The almighty ant-eater ferociously savagely devours the
{Y}  ants as fast as he can, but be wary, for if you try to get too
{Y}  close there is no telling what this fierce creature with a rather
{Y}  funky-nose might do to you.{b}

At A Dead End In The Wilderness Of Darkness~

The trail has come to a dead end. Eerie sounds can still be heard coming
from the west. The ground below your feet is so hot that hell has to
be within this area. The feeling of evil has overcome you and evil
thoughts is all you have.

{R,BO}Entering the Depths of Hell{b}~

{BLA,BO}  Entering the depths of hell, demons and devils swarm around you.
{BLA,BO}  The heat coming from the ground assures you that you are about to
{BLA,BO}  enter the chaos and agony and pain felt when in hell. Eerie
{BLA,BO}  sounds seem to be getting louder and closer and fear begins to
{BLA,BO}  run through your body.{b}

{R,BO}Descending Further Into the Depths of Hell{b}~

{BLA,BO}  As you descend further down into the depths of hell, the evil
{BLA,BO}  spirits and eerie sounds begin to swirl around you like chaos.
{BLA,BO}  The heat from the burning flames of hell is getting hotter as you
{BLA,BO}  go further down and get closer to entering hell.{b}

{R,BO}The Depths of Hell{b}~

{R,BO}  As you step into this evil fortress, you notice all around you is
{R,BO}  consumed in flames and the screams of people are piercing as they
{R,BO}  send shivers through your spine. The hair on every part of your
{R,BO}  body stands on end and you know you have finally reached the most
{R,BO}  darkest, evil and empty place in the universe.{b}

The Lair Of The Demon Warriors~

Lining the walls are several medium sized thrones made of fire
and brimstone which cast eerie shadows over the ground. Sitting
in each of these 3 thrones are creatures with long horns and 
broken wings of a gargoyle. They peer down upon you with devilish
glares as if they were sucking your soul from your body.

{R,BO}Outside the Dungeon Cells of Hell{b}~

{R,BO}  The screams you have been hearing earlier are much clearer now
{R,BO}  and are very close. You can see two very large doors before you
{R,BO}  that are made of limestone. At the top of the doors you see the
{R,BO}  heads of cobras perched on top of the base of the door as if they
{R,BO}  were ready to strike. The eyes in the heads seem to be empty. You
{R,BO}  can only imagine what is happening on the other side...{b}

{R,BO}  As you finally make your way through the doors, you notice that
{R,BO}  this is made up of many different rooms or torture chambers. You
{R,BO}  cannot see into any of them, you can only make out visibly what
{R,BO}  seems to be tiny corridors sealed by small bars with no hinges.
{R,BO}  Guarding your way into this area stands the Keeper of the
{R,BO}  Dungeon. He quickly jumps in front of you and looks you up and
{R,BO}  down amazed at your very clean appearance and unmarked skin. It
{R,BO}  looks as if you have been discovered...{b}

It seems you have found temporary sanctuary in this well-hidden secret room.  A

The End Of Happy Land ! =-(~

The feeling of ease and calmness suddenly ends in this vicinity.
There seems to be no friendly chirping, no pleasant aromic nature
air.  Nothing.  It seems to be a void of some sort, nothing alive
nor dead seems to have ever been here.  You scratch you head
and ponder in disbelief.  Upon further investigation you also
notice that there are no pretty flowers or colourful picturesque
rose bushes, either.  Just trees.  This forest seems to be 
getting more strange everyday.

A Peaceful Forest~
You are standing in a beautiful and peaceful forest that gives
you a complete sense of ease.  Small furry and cuddly animals
prance about slowly, chewing grass in this lovely picturesque
forest.  You sit down and relax a while and take in the beautiful
surroundings only to realize that theres something a little wrong
with this picture.  Maybe the animals are a little too friendly.

{CYAN}{BOLD}On A Beautifully Colored Path{cyan}~
Walking further you notice things are starting to appear normal
once again. Although that beautiful smells lingers at your side
as you continue on. In every direction up ahead, all you see are
trees towering nearly a thousand feet into the sky, nearly darkening
it. There seems to be alot of different paths to follow just a 
pebbles throw away. As you continue on, the odd looking hand that
has been beckoning your every move...stands before you once again, 
mutters a few prayer like sounding phrases and vanishes. You feel
a little more empty inside as it disappears, as well as lost and 
abandoned. You have two choices now..you can turn back since you
still know how to leave this strange dimension, or you can slay
your fears and move forward. The choice is yours, choose wisely,
for one day you will be judged regardless. Continuing the journey
may prepare you for that day to come...

Your smile could be seen from miles away. Things around you look
so new. It feels like you are seeing things for the first time.
Many different colors gleam around you on every surface of every thing.
Seems strange how you've become more aware of things since you
first began in your journey. You have already learned alot it seems
and you haven't really traveled to far yet. This alone should make
you wonder what all of this preparation is for. Then again..you
don't really care right now..your surroundings are so magnificent,
they seem to pull you into them. Remember..NEVER lose your focus...

{CYAN}{BOLD}On A Wonderfully Smelling Path{cyan}~

As you continue enjoying the tanatlizing smells you egin to realize
that things are slightly changing in the way they look. Looking
around you notice your sight getting better,not only physically
but your mental eye as well. The trees start looking more detailed,
the stones beneath your feet even look to be more defined. Odd...
that familiar looking hand waves to you from the west...beckoning
you to follow. You take one last wonderful breath and slowly breath
in and out as if it were your last and continue on.

{CYAN}{BOLD}On A Wonderfully Smelling Path{cyan}~

The many fragrances that you smell nearly hypnotizes you with their
beauty.  Your head feels light and your knees slightly tremble as 
you move due to the sweet smell of nature.  This is a very peaceful 
atmosphere as well as a mysterious one... even still you know you need to stay
focused.. who knows what or whom may lie ahead of you in this very
new journey.

{CYAN}{BOLD}On A Well-Travelled Path Of Destiny{cyan}~

Somewhat famished you eagerly search for some food. You think surely there
must be some food in this beautiful forrest. Peering around you, you once
again notice a small bush push aside to reveal a hand waving you in.
You scratch your head in curiousity and wonder what creature is motioning
you...is it an evil monster? Is it a helpful one? Make your decision young
one.

{CYAN}{BOLD}On A Well-Traveled Path Of Destiny{cyan}~

As you merrily walk through the beautiful terrain you notice a slight
movement of the bush to your right.  You glance at it and study for a moment,
curious more than anything.  You shrug helplessly, baffled by the movement.
The low-pitched gurgling noise you know well, for it is the sound of your stomach
demanding attention.  You quickly unstrap your backpack and take out a delicious
carrot when a white blur jumps on your, grabs the carrot with its teeth and hops
off of you and into the forest.  Shocked and bewildered you frown at the fact that
the white blur took your food.

{MAGENTA}{BOLD}Entering The Mystical Realms of Anavius{magenta}{bold}~

Surrounded by colourful roses, flowers, and plants the surroundings seem to
give you a certain sense of warmth and love. The sounds of birds chirping
allleviates your stress and heightens your senses. Looking down the small
path to your west allows an almost picturesque view of the terrain. Various
animals walk by your feet and without fear.
