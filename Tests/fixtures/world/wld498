{CY}
  Entering the tiered square, the familiar spray of 
  fountain water comes into view. The upper deck was
  added to the old square long ago. Large marble 
  planters have been strategically placed along the
  rails and the ivy cascades overlooking the fountain. 
  There are marble benches near the ivy where lunchers
  rest and take in fresh air. This place knows no rest.

  The giant marble steps spiral downward toward the      
  intricately designed fountain.  A mosaic of orange,      
  yellow, gold and blue tiles reflects the sunlight 
  from above. The cities popular gathering place is 
  home to bistros and delicatessens awaiting hungry

  Even with all the technical advances, the
  {W,BO}Post Office{w,bo}{C} remains an institution. Citizens 
  rush in and out, checking and writing mail.
  The citizens prefer hand crafted armour to 
  machine stamped breast plates as well as old
  fashioned letters. {R}The Armoury{C} to the south
  is still in high demand after a hundred years.

  Here the road forks.  The north fork becomes{W} Temple
  Lane{C} while the west and east forks will bring you from
  the beach to the forest and back again. The road is 
  wide and made to carry many people where they need 
  to go.  Along the way, there are many chances for 
  adventure should one choose to turn to the north
  or to the south. Going south here would be the 
  start of a nice stroll through Diamond Park.

  The road between the beach and center city
  changes greatly. To the east, the road is
  overpowered by the odor of fish and the noise
  of pesky seagulls. To the west, the city isn't
  much better. The difference is that the seagulls
  are pigeons and the fish smell is trash. Someone
  ought to tell the mayor about this.

  Seagulls can be heard all about, singing their 
  haggard song of merriment.  Scrub brush and crab 
  grass cover the distance of beach visable to the 
  west.  A gentle breeze pushes a thin layer of sand 
  across the road ahead.  A small ship is toiling about 
  in the harbor to the west, fishing.  Small specks, 
  autonomously moving themselves about, mark 
  themselves as people along the shoreline.

  the boardwalk is still a happening place

  The crossroads often cause people to stop and
  ponder the direction to take. Here's a clue:
  Fishermans Alley leads right to the beach and
  is a great alternate route to take in the
  traffic of the beach season, but in doing so
  one has to endure the dock traffic of the alley.
  Ancestor's Street is the complete opposite of
  the alley. It is a place of reverence and respect
  for all things and people.

{Y}Leatherworkers Road{y}~

  To the south, there is a dark store front
  with a sign that points around to the back 
  of the building. Tattoos have become a much
  desired form of art, but the industry appears
  as dark and hidden as ever. East of here is 
  Main Street.  The dusty road stretches on to
  the west.

{MAG} Lower Eudelta Square {mag}~
{Y}
  Shadowed by the above tier, bistros and delis fill
  the air with a sweet aroma of roasted garlic and
  basil. The two story fountain in the center sprays
  water from the top tier sending it down into the  
  the brazen bowl.  The mosaic reflects the sun 
  illuminating the thousands of orange, yellow, gold
  and blue tiles' abstract design.  A few ferns and 
  ivies hang from the rustic wooden supports near the
  bookshop and newsstand. The square is perpetually
  bustling.

  The sky is clear above the great fountain.  There are 
  ivy plants cascading from above.  The twenty story 
  buildings look twice as high from this depth. The upper
  level's energy echoes as pedestrians shout to friends below.
  The grand marble steps lead upward into a world of 
  adventure and concrete.  Yet, the upper level seems 
  cleaner somehow.

  the marble ramp reveals the latest station technology 
  has to offer.  The soundless rails and high speed train
  await passengers.  From here it doesn't even look all 
  that crowded.

  Though it is just a block from Pyrite Lane

  Though the world sometimes shimmers like gold,
  Pyrite Lane is a gloomy place. A few older 
  shops stuck between the old water and electric
  company buildings offer a refuge from the daily
  grind of those who work on this street. The old
  factories pump thick smoke into the atmosphere.
  Paint peels off the sides of the buildings adding
  to the dreary look of Pyrite Lane.

  While other parts of Eudelta look as new 
  as the day the city was opened, this sector
  has been left to fend for itself. Tucked in 
  the underworld of the upper levels, Pyrite
  Lane is dingy and dirty. Workers rush about
  answering the call of factory whistles. The
  broken, boarded windows are a constant 
  reminder that this is a high crime area.

  The steps lead to a large gathering place. The smell

  all to indulge. The large fountain sparkles in the 
  light. What does this city have to offer? Only one

  Outside of Benson's Tavern, people

  Market Street is not the cleanest part of the
  city though city officials try to keep it clean. 
  Shoppers and vendors scurry about pulling goods 
  in and out of storage in hope to find jsut the 
  right items. Far too often, items end up like 
  trash on the street.

  Looking through store windows used to

  With increased crime on this street,
  many of the store owners are just happy to
  still have windows. However, they  don't make 
  a habit of decorating them any longer.

  Something at this end of Market Street always

  coming in from the west. Either way, Market 
  Street's atmosphere changes at this point. The
  old buildings, filthy walkways, and dim lighting 
  seem to melt away.

  Standing here next to the small picket fence
  which blocks people from walking off the ledge
  and falling to all that lies below, a fine 
  salty mist and sense of calm fill the air.
  Out in the distance, boats sit on the horizon.
  On the beach below, children fly kites and 
  lovers snuggle in the sand. Scrub pines and 
  dune grass grow along the ledge. A deep breath
  is all it takes to realize things aren't so bad.
