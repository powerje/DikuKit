{BOLD}{RED}The {BOLD}{YELLOW}Mystic {BOLD}{GREEN}Planes {green}~


  {BO,C}You are standing on a flat field.  You are embraced by the only the
  darkness that surrounds you.  Even with your light source, you can
  barely see your way around.  Standing here, you can feel a layer of
  warm air sweep across your face.

Quack's Chambers of Doom~
  You walk into what seems to be an ordinary teenager's room.  But wait!  What
\is this milky white substance that drips from the ceiling and walls.  It's 
Quack's JIZZ! The very thought of this makes you vomit, adding to the overwhelming
stench of this place.  How could anyone live in such a place?  Yet as you peer 
about, you see piles of used condoms and the corpses of past lovers.
Some strange force inside you makes you long for more of these horrors.  Leather whips
and skin tight suits are discarded everythere.  As you gaze on Quack's instrument
of lust, you feel aroused and being to subconsciously massage yourself.  Your
last thought is of how much fun this sick man must have.

Open gate, north is a bunch of kids they aren't aggressive, nor is the lifeguard (WaterWings) they are in a no-magic no-quaff room.
Be sure to use pummel/dpunch lifeguard or you will get creamed by those kids.  Set your wimpy high and when you flee south you quaff up and then go back north and fight again.  Waterwings are nice non-av arm eq.

They are in the high school.  High school is from park entrance: s,e,e,e,n,n
First mob is maintenance man (tool belt) pretty easy to kill for two non-avatars w/500 hps.
Second mob is class president (unfortunately i have never been able to hunt him) just wonder around and hope you see him.  Watch out for teachers some are anti-rune and cast killer Solar flares.  they don't wonder they just sit in the classroom.  Class president isn't aggr and he can be dispeled.  He wanders so be sure to follow him.  He hits kindda hard so watch for rescues. I'd set my wimpy high also.;Third mob is football player.  He is at the east end of school and down the stairs, west then north he isn't aggressive and he can be dispelled.  he is a breeze to kill and he guards the (football helmet).

So don't attack the cashier or the shopper in that room. Quaff to make sure the room is safe before you attack.  if you are fleeing all around don't us your pin or you might knock it off in the cashier room and she blocks pick up :(  Only use your pin before and after the fight!

{RE}The Ruins of the Fallen One{re}~
{BO,BL}
     I've destroyed everything I've done, and everything else burns
     in my fire... I choose remorse... All that has happened is
     engulfed by my fire... I stand when all else has burnt, alone
     at the end of time, empty beyond measure...
{bo}{RE}     
     The dim candle light reveals an empty, decaying room. Scribbled
     upon the crumbling walls are pictograms, equations, and verses
     in long forgotten languages. You wonder what it must have been
     like to fall from grace. You wonder about the struggles within
     the Corrupted One, the Angel living among men. There is no need
     to wonder... Within these walls, His pain is forced upon you.
{re}{BO,BL}
     You think you feel my pain?... You cannot begin to understand
     eternity alone... betrayed and forgotten by the one who created
     you... robbed of the love or acceptance all others have...

{BOLD}{CYAN}Midnight/Desperation/Obsession/BaRbIeGiRl's Chamber of Horrors{cyan}{bold}~
{BO,BL}
     After recovering from your stumble, you realize you are in
     a room with dark {G}green {B}walls. In the middle of the end wall
     is a large {R}fireplace {B}with beautiful candles adorning the
     mantle. To either side, pictures are hanging. Upon closer
     examination you see that the pictures are of the one you
     recognize as Death...
 
     A large comfortable couch and a television are also in the
     room. You don't wanna get too close to the couch though,
     you can see that only Midnight and Death rest there...
 
     On a rack to the other side is a {W}nurse's {B}uniform, whips
     and chains, a {W}sailor {B}outfit, a cowboy hat and various
     other costume items.
 
     The aroma of {R}roses {B}permeates the air and when you look
     down you just can't resist taking a flower.

{BO,B}Gung's Chamber of True Horrors{bo,b}~
{BO,BL}
     As you enter the dark room you notice a soft glow coming
     from the center of t{bo,Y}he room. You fe{BO,B}el as if it's drawing
     you towards it. As {bo,Y}you start walking{BO,B} you get the uneasy
     feeling that the {bo,Y}shadows are watching {BO,B}your every move.
     When you get clo{bo,Y}ser to the light you no{BO,B}tice it is an orb
     with some writin{bo,Y}g on it. It reads: By t{BO,B}he time you finish
     reading this you {bo,Y}will be {R}DEAD{Y}. As soon{BO,B} as you read the last 
     word you feel a ho{bo,Y}rrible pain in your{BO,B} back. As your vision
     starts to fade you {bo,Y}look up and see {BO,B}the terrifying face of
     Gung with a blood soaked blade laughing while he takes your
     life as he has so many others.

{BO}{Y}Zandu's{BO}{R} Place{r}~

   {B}Around you is the air of death which seems to fit this room
   very well.  You can see a bed with clothes littering its sheets
   and you can smell the faint scent of {BO,R}roses{bo,r}{B}.  You reach
   down to pick up what appears to be a {BO,R}rose{bo,r}{B}, however 
   when you grab it, it seems stiff and rough to the touch.  
   Suddenly, you feel a presence around you.  You turn around just 
   in time to see a thick blade going into your back.  It penetrates
   your lungs preventing you from uttering a single sound.  You fall
   backwards and into place as one among the thousands that have been
   slain by the silent assassin known only as Zandu.{b}

{G}Sable's Secret Garden{g}~
 
               I am like a rose in winter.
                   My heart is frozen,
                 My emotions are bitter,
            One touch could make me crumble,
              With tears of anger and hurt.
            My emotion's are at a stand still,
     Nothing seems to be moving in this barren land.
                     I once loved,
              But now it's turned to hate
       Against the person who put me in this state.
                 I once knew happiness,
                Now I only know sadness.
                No more tears can fall,
              They have all turned to ice.
                 No dreams can I have,
           For they have all turned to dust.
  And all my wishes have shattered into million pieces.
              I am like a rose in winter.
                  My heart is frozen,
                My emotions are bitter.

Unknown's Private Hell~
{BOLD}{CYAN}
Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.{BOLD}{BLUE}
        In restless dreams I walked alone
        Narrow streets of cobblestone,
        'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
        I turned my collar to the cold and damp
        When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of
        a neon light
        That split the night
        And touched the sound of silence.
