   {BOLD}{BLACK}You are now standing in the Upper Meeting room of the Chemically
   Deranged. You notice a lovely statue of Mara resting here, and

   portraits on the wall:
 
     {bold}{YELLOW}A Portrait of Pi, the CD Wizard with new ways.
     A Portrait of Madmax, Thrashrockerpunkerguy.
     A Portrait of Sunfire, with a sign that says "FREAK OUT!".
     A Portrait of Only, saying "Yeah.. Music is cool".
     A Portrait of DAYSTAR, who is a queen she is so sweet.
     A Portrait of Sandman, who is forever killing money mobs.
     A Portrait of Gordain, the big blue engine!{bold}

   {BOLD}{BLACK}You are now standing in Asbestos' Office. His desk is made up
   from 4 toxic waste barrels and a peice of plywood, which is
   stained from various chemicals. Several floor lamps are placed
   around the room, which do not appear to plug into any wall
   sockets, and they all glow green instead of white. There is a
   large poster of the Toxic Avenger hanging on one wall, and on
   the other a series of plaques which read:

high council hc~
High Council is the official governing body of Chemically Deranged.
    The High Council Chairman presides over the Council.
The High Council decides when and who they would like to reside among
when they find it appropriate. It is done through mutual agreement
of all HCers who are ACTIVE. It is very difficult for the HC to decide
who should join them for many people who are outstanding CDers must be
left out due to very limited spaces.
The High Council approves major changes and rules to the club through
mutual or majority voting, depending on the importance of the issues.
The High Council members are all equal with exception of the Chairman.
   It is the HC Chairman primary duty to dismiss inactive HC members
This must be done periodically to ensure the strength of the leadership.
The Chairman has a Veto power over any CD rule in case of emergency.
Otherwise the Chairman is equal to other HC members and has no special powers.
~
E
promo promotion~
Requirements for CD club level 8:
1. Advanced class level 20+ who knows at least one advanced-type zone well.
2. The candidate must pass a test based on the knowladge of the zone given
   by a member oh HC.
3. The candidate must know the club rules.
 -When membering a player into CD the club level 8 character must post
the name of the membered person on the CD board. The club level 8 must
show the new member around the club.
 -CD has always been proud of the union we have between our members.
Please attempt to member only people who you think might be of a good
character.
 Club level 9 is a honorary level given to long-time and oustanding CDers
at HC's discretion.
 Club level 10 is done through HC appointment as needed.
~
E
member membering~
To become a member of Chemically Deranged:
 1. a player must be at least NC level 10 (or be helped out to reach
level 10 on the initiation day by the membering person)
 2. a player who already belongs to another club CANNOT join CD unless
no CD player 'reasonably' objects to him or her becoming part of CD.
In this case the player must wait at least 24 hrs while CDers post
their comments on CD board or mudmail it to an HCer. The nomination
for the player who wants to join CD must be posted on the CD Board.
3. a player who leaves CD and wants to come back is to be treated in
the same manner as the rest of NCers outside of CD with respect to
membering.
4 a player who already has another player in CD can member his/her
characters into CD at any level unless they belong to other clubs.
 CD has always been a club that helped out its new members. However
we do not need people who join us to gain help and then leave our club.
