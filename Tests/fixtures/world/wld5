     FF8 is a huge non-linear zone with a ton of cool stuff you can
  use it for. There are no saccing or acid mobs in FF8.  The only DT 
  here is a flying DT that is totally avoidable.  So basicly getting
  lost exploring this vast zone isn't gonna be the end of the world.

"Welcome to the -{YELLOW}{BOLD}FM{yellow}{bold}- Hotel!"  says the receptionist.  She is bright and
perky and ever so willing to please.  "I hope your stay here is pleasant."

The lobby is bright and cheery, all the woodwork gleams and the fixtures
are all made of gold which has been burnished to an almost painful sheen.
The floor is made of the finest imported Shari-lampuur tiles, and the 
furniture is made of Dragon-hide.

{WHITE}-{YELLOW}{BOLD}FM{yellow}{bold}- {CYAN}MAIL ROOM{cyan}~

  This room is very dark, sort of old and dingy looking and very very very
dry and dusty smelling.  You stand before a wide counter.  Behind the
counter is a long wall that is covered by a shelving system that consists
of small wooden cubicles each with a members name on it.  An extremely old
man is shuffling along looking at the boxes.  He has a letter in his hand,
and you can just barely hear him muttering, "Aqua...Aqua...where's the
$$*! box for Aqua?"
 
After a couple seconds, the elderly gentleman notices you and shuffles up to
his side of the counter.

Thou SHALL NOT summon ANYONE into the clubhouse.
Thou SHALL read and abide by the club policy.
Thou SHALL NOT Spam the mud, or be obnoxious as this would bring dishonor
     not only to yourself, but to all of -FM-.
Thou SHALL read the -FM- board to keep current with what is going on in -FM-.

apolicy~

We as -FM- will not PK (Player Kill) until we have reached the proper level.
As it stands now, members of -FM- are required to be level 50 AVATAR to 
become eligible to receive a PK flag. If you so desire, you can fight anyone
at any time in the Star Battle Field, in there, nobody will lose or gain
Con or Exp.

To be a Member of -FM-, a player must be atleast level 10 and have had two
nominations posted on the -FM- board. After the second is posted, the
player will wait one full Real Life day for discussion on his/her/it's 
membership. After the day has passed, if no objection has been posted,
that player will be membered into -FM-. However, if for any reason, a
current member objects to the players membership, the player will NOT
be membered. This is not indefinite, if the player in the future proves
to be again worthy, so be it.
New members: Look Level

Dir from Market [] are s,2e,2s,10w,s,3u,s,2w,s,2w,n,2w,n,e,3n,w,n. At this 
point you should be at the landing. From there go w,n and you are in the 
Permafrost forest. Equipment is owl wings, polar bear gauntlets, whalebone 
plate mail, walrus tooth, and some other goodies. This area is rather 
difficult. I would not suggest doing it alone, I am level 50/39 and I died 
several times. Avatars are needed.  Teal potions do not work to well in most 
areas due to the coldness. They freeze and shatter when being quaffed. Another 
bad part is the coldness will kill you. Every shiver is -1 HP, so when you 
flee due to wimpy, you are screwed. Blue whale has plate mail and he is very 
hard. Polar bears have gauntlets and they are a pain in the ass due to the 
fact that they are hunting you and will continue. Take lots of help and 
becareful. There are no real DT's but there is one room with no exits(only 
"dt") so u should be ok!   enjoy!!  Pman

Wess's axpansion have some rather good xp, like Leprechaun shoes, Baggy pants, 
 Chainsaw and Blade Glove..You have to be lvl 25 to go there, and you have to 
be a couple of high lvls or Avatar to get equipment. Baggy pants is the 
easiest to get. Directions from ms: 6e,2u,2s,e,3s,e,all s,e,all d,all n,2w,d
 Here is Elephant man, who has Baggy pants. To get to shoes go one more d, 
can't remember dirs exactly here, but its a small area, you'll find it if you 
wander around..Then you find Leprechaun, and want to find chainsaw or glove, 
youu go north toll Godzilla. He have a key (tooth) you need to open manhole 
(down). Open manhole, all d, all s, here you find leatherface with chainsaw.
To get to freddy krueger u need a key, from leatherface n,e elephant man have 
key. Freddy is behind door south for leatherface. Guess that was all. Be 
carefull, they hit HARD sometimes... :)   Beav

                                OLYMPUS     
     This is a good area for low to mid-level char's to get their feet wet.
There's some decent eq scattered around (check out the ambrosia), plenty of
cash, and plenty of exp without serious risk for levels 15-25.  As always, 
take plenty of teals the first couple times.  For higher levels 25+, the 
hounds of war provide PLENTY of exp.  Be warned that many mobs there can cast 
silence and that a couple (not very hard ones) are agressive.
From outside the west gate go 3n,2e,5n,3e,5s,3e,3u. (you must be able to fly
to go all the way up Olympus).

                        From Market Square: 6w n
 
            Reasonably good money, but will shift you to evil.
            I  believe there might be a DT in the forest, but
              I'm not sure, as I hunt in a different manner.

                       Strolling Through Paradise!

   This is a area with GOOD coins. Pigs have 700k each. Menehune haven't 
I tried yet, but birds haven't much coins. I haven't found any agg mob 
there yet (and haven't found DT either).
Dirs are from river delta: 3e, n till end, u till end, n, d, n
***Note*** (dir to river delta from levee: s,2w,4s)
 
Not sure what lvl this area is best for, but I did it "easy" lvl 37 mage.
 
Thats all for today. Beav.

drow~
                                    Drow
 
     Directions to Drow: from Market Square, east till Turning Ppoint, 
                      4s,2e,s,2e,d,w,s,2d and Your There!
 
 Mobs are mostly aggressive and offer a range of 10k-150K+ eq isnt great but 
its good for mild players just learning to play..
                  level of char's should range perhaps 15-20+ 
       meanwhile main prizes there are a ruby ring and a spider dagger.
 
There is 1 DT and it is in a temple at the Altar and the direction to hit the 
DT is DOWN from the altar..
 
Good place for newbies to solo for some good exp since the mobs are fairly
weak.. also good for small groups for better chances of living :/

tree~
                                 Great Tree
 
      Directions to Great Tree: From Market Square go west ALL the way.
 
Mobs range in exp from 5k-80k with main mobs at the very top called treeson.
Squirells are aggressive, and one should be flying while exploring this area 
because on the very first level is a branch limb that leads down to the 
valley of kings and is a DT if you are not flying. Players levels should 
range from 10-25 with higher levels needed for the 2 main mobs up top. there 
is also a treasure room where the treasure is about 30 mobs in a room that 
they cant flee out of! Good exp for fast killers who hate flee! Avoid valley 
of kings as it has aggres mobs that can kill avatars!

                    Elemental Canyon By Warlord/Gozarian
Directions to Elemental Canyon: from Market Sqr. go east till Turning Point. 
then 4s,3w,2e,4n,e then go up all the way. your In Elemental Canyon now.
Rocks,Sparks,particles,warriors all yield about 80-100k experience.Level 25+ 
needed.. tiny elementals small elementals and large elementals 30+ lvl. 
naturally if your have better eq you dont need to be that high to go, just be 
sure to bring alot of teals because EDDIE's are aggressive and are worth 
aprox 80k exp to give u an idea of its str. Elemental Guardians,Rulers, and 
Cyclopse are NOT to be tried by anyone below lvl 50 without great risk! 
Rulers are also very aggressive so avoid them as they offer 12mil exp. 
Cyclops should only be tried by mid-high lvl Avatars and are worth aprox 
25mil exp. This place is a treasure for Mid level players as it has unlimited 
mobs! Enjoy it, but beware the occassional lightning storm <ouch!>.

draconia~
                       "Draconia" by Warlord/Gozarian

  Directions to Draconnia: Go to market square, west all the way to colossal
tree, its just east of the great tree.. when ya see this colossal tree, go 
north all the way till ya get there.. and Wala! yer there! Ok,  mobs are 
worth 5k-250k+ with only the dragon tiamat being about 160k exp and he holds 
the golden dagger! This place is unique in the sense that it is pretty 
mid-low lvl for players, yet the eq is somewhat good for its class of mob! 
Bodyguards are somewhat aggressive but are pretty much pushovers.. The king 
is worth 160k exp and holds good leveling eq in shield. There are alot of 
keys needed to enter certain areas so keep those keys ya find there! Also 
there is 1 DT and it is in the direction of DOWN at the clearing into a well. 
dont enter that well! All in all, a good place for mid lvl's to gain easy exp 
and somewhat good eq for the class of mob that is there! Bon Apetite!

kong~
  Directions to Jungle of Kong: From Market Sqr. go S,2E,2S,west all the way
                                then north once... and your there!
   Kong is fairly low level area, very low exp ranging from 800 to about 150k 
for main mob which is Kong.. this is for the extreme newbie with a taste for 
exploring! There are NO Dt's that I have found, and the mobs yield fairly 
newbie Eq. of which I found perhaps  4 items that a newbie would use! Ya wont 
use it much, but it gives a newbie a good feel for exploring and hunting for 
a treasure and hidden rooms.. perfect for beginners!

 Directions to Aucan Village: From Mrkt Sqr. S,2E,2S, West all the way,3N,
5W,N and yer there!! Beware! God damn Iggy's live there and they Suck!! 
they steal yer gold, yer Eq. and they even follow you!! Either run past 
them FAST or kill em quick! they are worth over 300k exp and are fairly tough 
as they multihit.. This area is for mid level players to slightly low lvl 
round 20's as it has some very easy mobs ranging in exp from 1k- 350k which 
is for the main mobs with keys... This place is great! Very good eq for the 
level and there is an abundance of it! Good AC! good attributes changers..

damn good stuff! <but can ya find it? Smart Adventurers wanted!> I found No 
Dt's here so this place would be great for a Midlevel group quest, Have fun! 
I Did, and the prizes are Kewl ;)

good stuff. This EQ is east 3 times 2s,to ringkeeper from just inside the keep
. Kill the ringkeeper he has many keys for many doors south. Be careful keys

  Ok FM'ers! This zone is another low to mid avatar grouped area. You should
probably take 3, that should be enough, 4 is your group is lower leveled
avatars. All the eq there is unlimited and amongst the best and easiest to
get. Eq includes Lava Belt, Amulet of Leviathon, Crown of Hellicia, Cloak
of Ezekial, and Midnight Wings of Bane. Be sure to be flying as some sections
are DT's if not. Dirs: M[], 14e,3n,2e,2n,u,4w,4n,7e,2s,3e,3s,3w,3u,4e,6n,
4w,3s,4e,open rock,n,4d,e,3d,s,2e,3s,3w,2s,e,d. Whew!
Careful, mobs are super aggressive. Good luck!

  Hail FM! This zone is for grouped avatars only! 3 minimum, 5 to be super
safe. Bats, Cats, and other lil nasties are super aggressive from the 
begining. I'm not sure of the DT's here, but i can tell you the eq is
first rate! Bat suit, Cat's eye, Pickle Barrel, Joker' Feather, Afro rings,
Penguin's umbrella are among some of the great eq there. Careful though,
as each piece is held by super tough mobs just waiting for ya!
Dirs: M[], all east, south at the gate, easy eh? Good luck!

mk~
  Hello FM'ers! This zone is not for the timid. No normal mortals will 
survive here! Grouped avatars only! 3 to 4 should be able to make it 
through to the end, but once you are at the last mob, you should have
atleast 5 heavy hitters, if you are hoping to make it thru Shaokahn!
All of the eq there is top of the line, the problem is, the mobs are
reflective of that fact. On the main path to Shaokahn, the rooms are
No-magic, so, be on guard and you get Fan of Defense, Ring of Frost,
Belt of Goro, Wristband of Liuchang, Robe, Kintaro Collar, and even the
Spear of the Underworld, held by Shaokahn himself!
Dirs: M[], 6w,3n,2e,5n,3e,5s,3e,3u, this gets you to olympus, hunt Zeus
dows and open his throne, go down, ignore the mob there and pick the door
that is down.

pentara~
  If you want an ultimate challenge and have 6+ hours to quest, this is the
place for you! Bring a group of 6 or more mid to high level avatars and
dont by shy with the healing potions. Thieves steal eq, Beggars steal gold,
Soldiers will attach on site if you are an outlaw, and attack a Beggar or
Thief the wrong way, and be placed in jail! Not for the timid. If you
successfully complete this massive quest, you will surely be rewareded with
the Cloak of Death, Scythe, Mercury Boots, Helm of Acid Resistance, Helm
of Alignment Changing. All eq if top quality and the quest is one for teh
record books! And it's record HARD!
Dirs: M[],s,4e,2s,enter ship, and your jouney begins!
                   Good luck!

final fantasy~
  Ok folks, this zone is for low level mortals in the town of Narshe
itself, and mid to hi grouped avatars for the hidden passageways leading
to the dojo, karate school, and the path to Kefka. Ranma is worth 300mil
exp, so be careful! Kefka also blocks. Lotsa good eq here if you can find 
it under the limit, so check it out! Best eq here is Genji Gloves, Ranma's
shirt, headband, atma weapon, genma's sign, akane belt, and of course
Kefka's Illumina Sword!
Dirs: M[], 11w,n,all u, and you're in!
      Avatar section: open passageway west, or you can try to go directly
                      to Kefka by way of the continent above the clouds 
                      north of Narshe. Give it a try! It's surely worth a
                      whirl!

carnival~
  Ok! This is for high level morts (50) to mid avatars! It's exp range is
from 6mil for lower freaks to 35mil for the Ring Leader! Leveling here
is an excellent idea as the Zombies are plentiful and worth about 11.5mil
in exp each. Some eq here is Ring Leader's hat, armband of courage, overalls
floppy feet, and lacaster's belt.  There are no DT's, so, enjoy this zone!
Dirs: M[],8e,4n,2e, and you're there!  Have Fun!

As it stands now, members of -={BO}{YE}FM{bo}{CY}=- are required to be level {BO}50 ADVANCED{bo}{CY} to 
become eligible to receive a {BO}PK{bo}{CY} flag. 
    
To be a Member of -={BO,YE}FM{bo,CY}=-, a player must be atleast level 10 and have had two
nominations posted on the -={BO,YE}FM{bo,CY}=- board.  After the second is posted, the
player will wait one full Real Life day for discussion on his/her/it's 
membership. After the day has passed, if no objection has been posted,
that player will be membered into -={BO,YE}FM{bo,CY}=-.  However, if for any reason, a
current member objects to the players membership, the player will {BO}NOT{bo}{CY}
be membered.  This is not indefinite, if the player in the future proves
to be again worthy, so be it.
