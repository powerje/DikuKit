{BL,BO}Entrance {b}{BLA}to a {BL,BO}Grove {b}{BL}of {BL,BO}Shadows{b}~

  Before you lies the grove of shadows. Giant grey trees
are all that can be seen through the thick shadows. A great
sense of both power and menace permeates the surrounding
area. You have a strange urge to turn back and go the way
you've come.
