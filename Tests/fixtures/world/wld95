  darkness and neither does the light you are
  using. You stand in front of the Altar of Doom.
  A great force beckons you: {R}Dare to challenge me?

Guard room of the Altar~
{BL,BO}
  The tower is colder and darker still as you approach the altar.
  Anticipation builds as you move closer to the altar. Blood 
  drips from the ceiling and splatters the floor. You wince with
  concern for your own existance.

The Altar of Doom~
{BL,BO}
  You thought you could find an easy way to the top
  of the Tower of Doom. IMPOSSIBLE! Face death like 
  a true warrior! That is, you can't get to the top
  from Tapestry smartass!

The battle ground~
{Y}
  You feel a a chill as you stand on the battleground.
  The gore before you play out in your mind. The 
  crushed bones, the bloodshed, the rotting corpses in
  contorted position. Who or what were they fighting?

The battle ground~

  All around you are the remains of great warriors. Some
  you even recognize by the armour which they wear. Their
  legends you have heard since childhood. Often you wondered
  where they all went. Now you know...

The Altar of Doom~

  Standing at the top of the Tower of Doom, pride
  fills your bossom. Reaching this altar proved

  virtuous.

A misty tunnel~
{C}
  The walls have closed around you as you push
  your way through this tunnel. It is difficult
  to see what is ahead and what is behind through
  the mist which fills this cramped space.

A misty tunnel~
{C}
  You reach the end of the tunnel and have to make
  a decision. With two choices available, turn back
  or move forward, you examine the cover which 
  prevents you from moving forward.
