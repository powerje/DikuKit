You are in the great council hall of this facility.  You seen maps and battle
plans tacked up on the walls.  The fighting here seems also to have been 
quite severe.  The marines must have fought to the last man to protect their
leaders.

A Landing~
This large room used to contain a garden, complete with trees and birds and a
large pool of water.  However, whatever attacked this place has turned the 
water into toxic waste from which a foul smell arises.  You are glad someone
decided to build a path across this pool.

This passageway was once used as an escape route if all methods of defense
failed.  However, it has been long forgotten and neglected and even the forces
of evil which overran this base have not found it.  The passageway appears to
have collapsed, but you can just make out a crack which leads down through
the rock.

You are standing before a fantastic door.  You wonder how such a massive object
was placed in this position.  It seems to form a gate straight into the
mountainside.  While it is not that tall or wide, it is 15 feet thick, thick 
enough to stop any force.  However, it has been ripped off its hinges and the
path to the inner sanctum is left un defended.

The End...~
This appears to be the end of the line...the tunnel into the heart of the base
has been collapsed.  But wait...Off to the east you see a gaping hole in the
earth.  It is as if some huge body forced its way up out of the ground.  Now
things seem to make for sense.  The invasion force was not from without, but
from within.  As you approach the hole, you feel the presense of evil.

A Daiz~
On this diaz, the great leaders of the army planned attacks and defenses for
over 1000 years.  But the thrones on which they once sat have been burned and
the tapestries forming the walls have been defaced with strange markings.  
There are no corpses here.  Strange...

A Great Hall~
You are in the great council hall of this facility.  You seen maps and battle
plans tacked up on the walls.  The fighting here seems also to have been 
quite severe.  The marines must have fought to the last man to protect their
leaders.

Tic's Lab~
So this is the workroom of a god?!  As you look around you see various 
concoctions bubbling away.  One the blackboard you see intricate plans
detailing the contruction and maintainence of an entire world.  In one
corner is you see the partially formed body of a monster.  You wonder, 
"Can anyone actually be expected to live here?"

A Neutral Corner~
For a prise fight, this arena is amazingly quiet.  In fact, you notice that
there are no fans present, no bright lights, not even a pretty card girl
to display the rounds.  Is this really a legal fight?

The Waiting Room~
In this room, many warriors have waited for their turn to die at the hands of
their brethern.  Even now, you see other brave souls checking their
equipment one last time.  You've never seen such an array of warriors and
you wonder if you have the skills and courage to survive.  You notice that
some writing has been chisled into the wall.

The Morgue~
The stench of this room is enough to drive you mad.  You see piles of...well
not really bodies, more like peices of bodies and equipment piled about on
the floor.  You wade through the muck and ooze searching for your corpse.

Entrance~
This appears to be an military base.  Once these halls would have been filled
with soldiers, but now they are strangely silent.  You've heard the rumors
that this base was over run but forces of indescribable evil and now, it
appears, those rumors have been proved true.

A Pool~
This was once a pool of water in the lobby of the military base.  At the
bottom you can see a few coins, which were tossed here by people seeking good
luck.  Even this pool seems to have benn touched by the evil of this place.
The water is dark and the goldfish which once inhabited this pool are
floating belly up in one corner.
