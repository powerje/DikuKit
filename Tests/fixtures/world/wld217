The Entrance to Mystic Icen.~
As you approach the tall main gates of the castle you see faces of
various races inside the frozen side walls.  They reach out and try
to grasp you to be released from their frozen state of being.  Much
of the walls are etched and carved with symbols that are unknown to
you. While studying the surrounding runes and symbols, one of the
creatures in the walls appears to be breaking free, an crack in the
wall appears and the ice starts to shatter in several parts. The 
creature appears to be some sort of golem.  With fear and awe, you rush
backwards and unsheathe your swords and raise your shields.  The 
creature has broken free and is know in a state of shock.  Not sure
of what to do, you remain a safe distance.  After a few moments, the
creature raises his hand and peers intently and you.  He takes a
step forward and raises his right hand.  The tall golem-like creature
transformed himself into a tall skinny wizard.  The wizard takes off

On The Path Of Frost~
Your body shivers from the cold surrounding you.  You see many faces
frozen in agony along the walls to the side of war.  You wonder what 
possible create could do this.  You straighten your posture, gather
your courage and press onward.

The Intersection Of Fate~
Upon entrance to this room, you notice a frozen statue in the center, 
wielding a massive sword.  Although, he appears to be in a frozen state,
you get a feeling that he is eyeing your every move.  Looking to the
north you see a massive citadel with a gloomy cloud overhead, to the east
you can barely make out red eyes peering at you and to the west you
you see strands of electricity sparking off the walls.

On A Mystical Path~
This hallway seems to drain you of all your magical powers, the mana in
which you possess is gone and you see it lift up from your soul and head
to the eastern direction.  With spells and mana eliminated, you sigh, 
and begin to feel the pressure.

On a road to the Tower of Darkness~
You hear the scream of men, woman and children in the distance.  They
seem to be echoing through your head without stop, you pray
it will stop yet you know it will continue.  There are
a few rotted trees on both sides of you, leaf-less, life-less,
and although, there is no noise.  You sense you are being watched.  The yellow glow
from the moon makes you shudder itself.

The Conversion of Power~
This room is split in half with two completely unique entities of power.
In the north-western part of the room are magical sparks of mana reflecting
off the walls, while in the south-eastern part of the room are walls of
intense fire.  You can feel a gust of burning hot air rush into the 
room from the south, and a loud scream of pain is heard.

On a road to the Tower of Darkness~
You see small peasants pushing heavy carts along this part of the
road.  They are skinny, pale, and frail, their bodies burden with
years of stress and labor.  As you walk down the road further, an old
man falls to the ground and wails for help.  You rush to his aid with-
out heed, and give him a few heals to help him along his way.  The man
thanks you and bids you farewell.  But as you leave, he grabs your arm
and pulls his mouth close to your ear and whispers, "The dungeon is
haunted, the ladder is not where it is supposed to be, this I warn you,
heed it well my friend, and because of your oh so kind deed, this 
will require no such fee".  He staggers off leaving you to your quest.

You have come to the end of the road.  You have found the origin of
where the peasants come through.  To the North you see a mystic fog
that makes it hard for one to see clearly in.  To make sure it's safe
you grab a branch from a small, tree and throw in in the myst.  The
branch just fades away, as if it never existed.  Should you attempt
to enter this fog knowing that you may never come back?

You enter a hazy fog that makes it a strang to see your hand in front
of your face.  Every so often a shadow would appear and cause your
heart to beat faster ....and faster, and your body to tremble, the
shadow then fades away into existence, as if it never did.  You hear
the sound of snakes and gorgons nearby.  As your body relaxes and you
feel safe for movement, a pull on your leg causes you to spin and draw
your blade.  As you attempt to slash your opponent ...another arm appears
....and another....and another....what is this monster....You see a smal
opening in the swamp which indicates it is the direction to run in.

Amongst The Clouds~
After climbing off the ladder you step off onto a light, fluffy cloud.
The cloud begins to rise and you see an assortment of flying animals
surround you, glaring at you.  The animals get closer and closer until
one of your members draws his weapon.  The animals shriek in terror.  You
tell him to put the weapon away, he gasps , shrugs, and does as you 
command.  The flying animals once again leer closer.  One of the smaller
animals steps forward and squats, "You go to tower?...squaakk..."
Your group nods and smiles.  The bird smiles and bows his head, and 
once again begins to speak, "Then you will need this key to enter the
dungeon...Squakkkk...".  You ask him if there is anything in return you
can give.  The bird squaks, "Yes, Zevaran, my wife if trapped in that
tower, please retrieve her..!".  You nod and proceed along.

You see two large men standing here, staring straight ahead of them
and not moving an inch.  They are well armed and seem like well skilled
in the ways of the warrior.  As you pay more and more attentionto the guards a voice from the door speaks, "Hello Warriors", it says.
You and your party members jolt back not knowing where the voice is 
coming from.  Then one of your party members points to the door and you
all stare in awe.  The door once again speaks, "You must give the proper
entrance code to the door, or fight the guards which block it." Simply
say the word and the door will open." blurts the door.  You and your
comrades stare at each other and shrug.   
--> What is your choice?

You come to a 4-way intersection in the tower.  You hear grunts and mutters
from the east.  From the North, You hear loud snoring and moaning as if
something was dying.  To the south, It is too dark to tell.  As you
explore the room for anything useful, a screaming echo fills the halls.
As if someone or something was screaming in utter pain.  Small insects
crawl around you in search of food, they look larger than normal but of
no real threat.  The cobwebs, although, seem to be spread from one side
of the hallway to the other.  The sight of cobwebs doesn't fear you as
much as the fact of the bones stuck in them.

This room is even more messier than the hallway in which you arrived

This is really starting to make you sick.  As you think that you
are beginning to get sick from it, one of your other party members
keels over and as the 'puke' social would say, "Make a warm puddle" :)
But before you have time to take in the nice aroma of the room, you
notice the monsters that have created this.  They lumber towards you
and prepare to kill..

In A Damp Hallway~
As you proceed down the hallway with your group, the cobwebs and insects
seem to be thickening.  It makes seeing difficult and seems to somehow
be growing at a rapid rate.  After cutting your way to the end of the
cobwebs you sense that you are not alone. A shadow forms in front of you,
along with a high pitched shriek.  It reaches for one of your group 
members and graps his hand.  The shadow pulls the group member toward 
him and envelops it within itself.  The rest of your group, including 
yourself, are stunned with fear.  For several minutes you just stay there,
unknown to what has occured.  Then the shadow re-appears and extends its
arms wide, revealing your group member.  The shadow fades away out of
existence.  Your party member is frozen still, it seems he is in shock.
What has happened?  Is he dead?

In A Damp Hallway~
This room tends to be completely clean.  Nothing is dirty not even the
walls.  Insects seem to cringe in fear from this part of the hallway.
Then, as all seems right, a rush of insects pours through from every
direction amongst the walls.  They all scurry south in haste, it seems
they are completely ignoring you and rushing to do or see something.
Knowing where you are, you expect the worse.  You aren't exactly in
this for the pleasure so you and the others decide to see what the rush
is of..

A Dead End~
You have reached the end of the hallway.  This hallway seems to be 
unique, small patches of moss grow on the walls and on the ground.
You notice three small buttons on each side of the room. Each of the
buttons are a different color; green, blue, and red.  To the east
you see a small outline of a door in which the insects you saw in the 
room to the north are seeping through.

A Secret Tunnel~
After successfully pressing the buttons, you pat each other on the back
for a job well done.  You smell a fairly awful stench from the east and
make out soft music somewhere in the distance.  A small group of spiders
run up to you from the east, stop, then run backwards.  Within an instant,
You see a small eye approach you from the darkness.  The eye looks you over with great
interest.  The eye blinks and a disappears leaving a cloud of pink smoke.
Once the pink smoke clears, a figure approaches you.  The man is skinny
and frail, yet somehow you sense his power. On each side of his shoulders
lies a small, black spider.  The man gives you a quick grin and speaks
with a high-pitched voice, "You come from the outside world I see,...You
carry precious toys".  Before you can get a word of response he once again
speaks, "I am the Spider King, I rule the Insect World here in the tower,
You must leave or face my wrath."..He snaps his fingers and disappears.

Whispers In The Distance~
Evidently you did not heed the warning of the Spider King and
going to try and be heroes.  The room you have entered is completely
vacant.  You hear the scuttle of spiders and insects to the north and
it is assumed that the voice you hear is that of the King.  The 
mere silence and peacefulness of this room seems to scare you. 
If you prepare to go forward, be ready, I warn you my friends, 
be ready. :)

The Guarded Room~
Two huge Spiders, at least 10ft in height, appear to be guarding their
master.  Although they appear strong, you somehow feel that they are
laughing at you and are hoping you will go to the north.  The Spiders
begin to get bored of your existence and charge you with full force.

The room you have just entered is very small.  There is a bookshelf, a small
table, and several pictures hanging on the wall.  You can't make out
who the pictures are of, for the dust is to thick.  The army of spiders
has been expecting you, they are here in mass and without fear.  You
notice the Spider King in the back of the room packing some sort of
glowing object into a backpack.  He reaches behind him to reveal a 
lethal spider dagger that is fatal to the touch.

This hallway seems to be wider than the rest.  This doesn't appear to
have been made by the original designer, although.  It seems that some
large beings decided to make their mark on these walls.  There are
5ft. wide indentures in the wall.  You hear snoaring in further on down
the hallway.  Perhaps it would be best that you let them sleep?

Second Level Of The Tower~
You have finally made it to the second level of the tower.  You look
around you and feel that this level is even harder than the last.  You
politely ask one of your group members if he/she would do the honors of 
scouting the vicinity for anything that might be useful.  After a brief
quarrel on who should go, the group member agrees.  He leaves and returns
from each direction and gives a brief report.  To the west is some sort
of screaming voice.  To the east there appears to be people in chains.
To the north and south it was to dark to tell.
Each of your group members thank the scout and continue on your way.

There are skeletons of people chained to the wall with faces of sad-

to help these people.  It appears that this part of the corridor
seems safer than the rest.  You can tell because most of the

You and your group silently agree that something must be done anbout

with her head down crying loudly.  That is the source of the shrieking.
You slowly manage to drag yourself to the lady and shout in her 
ear, "EXCUSE ME, MA'AM!! WHY THE HELL ARE YOU CRYING SO DAMN LOUD?!"
She stops crying for a second and raises her head, stands up, and
turns her head toward you and yells, "THIS IS WHY!!".  The lady is
the most ugliest woman you have ever seen.  She raises her hands and 
slowly begins to levitate, "I see the way you look at me! No one insults
me and lives! Let this sight be your last!"
She screams and charges you !

The Lair Of The Demon~
This lair is burning of extreme heat.  It seems that this room is
an offshoot of HELL.  Flames and burning pot holes are spread 
throughout the room.  A large, red, winged creature sits in a large
golden chair at the southern most part of the room with it's legs 
crossed, eyeing your every move, grinning at your every move, he
simply laughs as you take each step closer and closer.  He continues
to laugh until you step on the rug in front of his throne.  It quickly
stands up and yells, "Enough! You have taken one step too close, now
let's see how you enjoy your last steps! Muhahaha...".  It raises it's
wings and flies right in front of your group.  He inhales a deep breath
and exhales, letting out a line of fire at your group.  You quickly
go on the defensive.  This is truely a Warrior Of Hell.
