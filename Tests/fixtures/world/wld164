by four underling Waugrats.  On his hands, the leader appears to 
be wearing a strong-looking pair of gauntlets.  A slight red aura 
appears around the gauntlets as he prepares to do battle with you.  
What kind of magic is contained in those gloves?

The Water Guardian~
 
        Before you stands the guardian of water.  It is a large being 
of ice, covering the entire door.  It makes this room very cold.  The 
ice appears to be very hard because of the intense coldness.

The Powerful Spellcaster~
 
       You have finally made it.  You have past all the guardians 
of the powerful spellcaster.  You are at the man.  He turns to you 
and smiles.  Hello, Adventurer.  You must be very intelligent to 
make it past my guardians.  In reward for your intelligence, I offer
you two things.
 
First, I offer my services.  I am a powerful spellcaster and know many
spells.  Look at my 'list' to see what services I can offer you.
Secondly, I offer my advice and knowledge.  In order to reach the
Demon, K'est Lufia, you must open a portal to his realm. I had a 
scroll that opened this portal, but I have misplaced it somewhere in 
this land.  If you can find it, you can find him and defeat him.  
 
Good luck.

The Hidden Chamber~
 
        You seem to have found the hidden chamber of the necromancer.  It 
is in here that he kept his most valued possession, his spellbook.  The 
spellbook is atop of a pedestal in the middle of an inverted pentagram.  It 
is lying open as if he was just consulting it.
