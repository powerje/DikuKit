   {BOLD,RED}The scent of ink and newly opened parchment is 
   overwhelming in this room. Gallons and gallons
   of {BLUE,BOLD}+{BOLD,RED}B{bold}{RED}O{BOLD,RED}D{bold}{BOLD,BLUE}+ {BOLD,RED}ink fill various containers scattered 
   across the room. It is believed that the blood
   of fallen enemies is mingled in the Ink. After
   thinking  about  this, you  realize that  your
   messages  must  contain the ancient  blood  of
   countless adventurers.{bold,red}
