Garden of Heathen~
{G}
  Recent excavation on Northern Crossroads has led to the discovery  of something
  quite amazing.  A land full  of mythical animals  and long forgotten  creatures
  now presents itself  for  exploration.  The  Immortals would  like to challenge
  all to see  what there is to see and find what there is to find.  All who enter 
  through these gates should  be warned that this area has not yet been made safe
  by the Immortals and that entrance is "at your own risk."

Garden of Heathen~
{G}
  Ahead lies the Garden of Heathen.  Is this a  parody of a Biblical land or is
  it something else entirely?  Will a Serpent offer an apple to an unsuspecting
  couple or do other surprises await to present themselves?  Ahead lies a field
  decked out in  the greens  of spring and the colors of the rainbow bloom from
  stems growing from the  fertile ground.  It is almost  enough to make someone
  remember  stories told on Sunday mornings of the beauty and  freshness of the
  perfect home for mankind.

A Green Field Filled With Flowers~
 
  The gently blowing breeze whispering through the brightly blooming flowers
  is enough to fill a soul of even the most vile individual with thoughts of
  peace and love.  The grass, though never having seen a scythe, is all of a
  uniform length as if it has been closely grazed and well fertilized in the
  uncounted years since this place was created.  The field extends as far as
  can be seen in all directions except for the west.  Off in the west can be
  seen some kind of water, perhaps a pond.

A Fruit Bearing Tree~
{G}
  A large atypical tree rises from the earth, it's fingers reaching for the
  sky.  The green leaves contrast nicely with the ripe  fruit that seems to
  ripen in every color of the rainbow.  Some of the fruit are long and thin
  while others are  round and fat.  High up  in the branches, something can
  be seen, and whatever it is, it's quite large.  The  branches obscure the
  view of whatever it is, but it is round, brown and at the  top of a tree.

In the Fruit Bearing Tree~
{GR} 
  At the upper levels of the tree the branches are still thick enough to support
  whatever weight is placed upon them.  The tempting, brightly colored fruit is
  even closer  now and all of it can actually  be reached.  The leaves that all
  were so green from the ground can now  be seen quite clearly and none of the
  leaves appear to be the same.  Oak leaves, pine needles  and just about every
  other tree that exists seems to be represented by  the branches of this tree.
 
  The item above is definitely a nest but the size of it makes it impossible to
  see if anything or anyone is inside it. The breeze blowing through the leaves
  disguises the sound of anything that may be in the nest.

Top of the Tree~
{G}
  At the top of the tree, where the branches are thin, is the largest nest in
  history.  What's really odd is that the top of the nest looks exactly  like
  the bottom.  There doesn't appear to be any way to get inside the nest just
  as there appears that there is not  any way to get anything out of the nest
  either.  What Dodo would make a nest with no way in or out?
{G}
  This may be definite proof of the reason for the extinction of the Dodo.

Shore of the Pond~
{C}
  The ripples on  the surface of this small pond cause miniscule waves that
  lap at the sandy shore.  The soft sand easily holds the footprints of any
  that walk on it.  Right now the only prints that can be seen are the ones
  of many small animals who come to drink.  The clear blueness of the water
  brings to mind just thoughts of purity and virginity.  To taste the fluid
  that makes all other water seem inferior is to taste the nectar of heaven
  which  was rained  down  to earth to create this  beautiful  pond.  Those
  thoughts  immediately squashed  by dread that  if this water is drank, no 
  other would refresh again.

A Gently Rippling Pond~
{CY} 
  This calm, serene pond appears to have been here since the 
  beginning of time itself.  Fish jovially  swim, doing fish
  things.  Even the mermaids flit about splashing each other
  and laying  around sunning themselves in this near utopian
  place.
 
  The water is neither too warm nor too cold.  It would seem
  as though this truly is paradise.

  The water is neither too warm nor too cold.  It would seem
  as though this truly is paradise.

A Gently Flowing Stream~
{BLU,BO}
  A merrily flowing  stream feeds into the pond at this point.  The
  crystal clear water flows over the top of the smooth rocks.  More
  tracks from animals can be seen on both sides of the stream offer
  proof that many animals, both large and small, come here to drink
  from the  clean, clear  water.  The serenity of  this place is as
  near perfect  as a  mortal  mind can grasp.  The anticipation  of
  further beauty is almost enough to cause insanity.  North of here
  can be seen the source of the brook.  A waterfall that is so tall
  that it seems to be coming down from Heaven itself.

The Waterfall From Heaven~
{C,BO}
  A giant waterfall spills water from  the very heights of heaven
  down to earth forming a small pool which in turn feeds a gently
  flowing stream.  A heavy mist hangs in the air at the bottom of
  the  waterfall with a bright colored  rainbow forever suspended 
  in the center of it.  Here forever is proof that there is not a
  pot of gold at the end of rainbow, but  there is a land of milk
  and honey.  The sound of the water crashing on the rocks causes
  ringing in the ears of anyone close enough to hear it, drowning
  out any other sounds.

A Wet Cave~
{BL,BO}
  This small cave ends behind a towering waterfall.  The sheets of
  water falling sparkle in  the light causing a prism of colors to
  cover the walls.  The sound that couldn't  be identified  before
  is now  deafening as the water  crashes to the rocks below.  The
  mists that  rise from the rocks cover everything  from the walls
  to the ceiling and everything in between.  Hints of rusting have
  already begun to set in on your equipment.

A Dark Cave~
{BL,BO}
  The low ceiling and the darkness both lend themselves to working
  an icicle of fear in to the spine of anyone brave enough to come
  in here.  Somewhere ahead the  smell of fresh air originates but
  there is no  light to show it's source.  Small roots  reach down
  from the ceiling grasping at  any loose clothing or hair.  Other
  than the sound of  the gravel crunching under heavy footfalls, a
  heavy rushing sound can be heard coming from someplace.

Ahead Lies a Forest~
{GR,BO} 
  Ahead lies a forest. This forest, unlike the rest of what has been seen so far,
  doesn't look very  inviting.  The sun seems  to have a hard time penetrating to
  the lower levels of the  forest.  That doesn't leave the ground as clear as one
  would imagine.  Fallen branches, decaying remains, and a small amount of under-
  growth all litter  the floor, while the lower  branches and moss hang down from
  the trees.  This place just gives off an aura of death and doom.  What happened
  to the beauty and serenity?

A False Trail in the Forest~
{GR,BO}
  Any trail that may have ever passed through this forest is long gone.  Each
  group of trees is so similar to the last that any hope of finding a way out
  is soon washed away.  The mossy fingers of the trees grope for  anything to
  snag, while the  upraised roots of the  trees seek  to ensnare unsuspecting
  ankles.  Pairs of {W}e{GR}y{W}e{GR}s can sometimes be seen peeking around from within the
  shadows, and  snapping sounds can  be heard as something  moves through the
  forest but just out of sight.  Looking  up at where  the sky used to be has
  become an exercise in futility since  the light  of the sun  cannot hope to
  ever penetrate the thickness of the trees to reach the ground.

Base of the Tree~

  A large  atypical tree rises from  the earth, its fingers
  reaching for  the sky. Green  leaves contrast nicely with
  the ripe fruit that seems to ripen in  every color of the
  rainbow. Some of the fruit are long and thin while others
  are round and fat. Branches obscure the view of the upper
  levels of the tree.  The only  way to find out what is at
  the top of this tree is to climb it.

White Gates~

  Ahead lies another set of gates.  This set is white but could not be
  described as pearly.  Peeking through the gates, the land behind it 
  definitely not to be described as the land of milk and honey.  The
  gates don't appear to have a lock.  If this is a test, the standard
  must not be very high to pass through these gates.

The Pearly Gates~
{W,BO}
  Towering far in to the sky  and breaking the path of the clouds is a
  set of Pearly Gates.  No lock appears to break the perfect lines and
  smooth surface of  the gates.  A piece of these gates  could be sold
  for  an unimaginable amount of money, but desecration of these gates
  would probably be a bad idea.  The question at this point would have
  to be if these gates are what they appear to be, who would be worthy
  to proceed past them?

Outside the Gates~
{W}
  The not so pearly gates  seem to have led outside the
  garden.  And even though not all of the garden was as
  beautiful one might think it should, heartbreak still
  sets in when leaveing it.
{Y}
  The land ahead is dry  and desolate.  The look of the
  land is enough to cause doubt  that anything can grow
  here.  This is absolutely a miserable place.  A small
  hut can be seen to the north. Why would anyone choose
  to live out here, when they can live in the garden?

The Mud Hut~

  The small size of the mud hut that stands here is almost insulting.
  It's hard to believe that anyone could survive out in this desolate
  land and choose to live in such a small hovel.  It's obvious that
  the hut has no more than 1 room.  To the south, the garden can be
  clearly seen.  Imagine living out here and still being able to see
  the garden.  What would possess someone to live out here?

  There is one other  difficulty involved in  being here,

Upper Branches of the Tree~
{GR,BO}
  By hugging the base of the tree and  carefully watching
  where  the thicker branches are at, it would seem  that 
  even someone with a lot of equipment can stand on these
  branches, but fighting here is another matter entirely.
  There is one other  difficulty involved in  being here,
  and that is the amount of  room. It's not possible that
  more than two people  are ever going to be able  to fit
  on these branches.

Near the Top of the Tree~
{GR} 
  Near the top of the tree the branches get thinner. This turns out to
  be a mixed blessing.  Once thinned out, the nearer part of the realm
  can be easily seen from this height.  However, with the thinner arms
  something else is happening.  The branches are beginning to snap and
  crack under their current burden.  Moving on would be a wise choice.

The Top of the Tree~
{Y}
  From the top of the tree it seems as though the entire world can be
  seen.  Midgaard, New Thalos and Rome are all clearly seen from this
  high up.  The scarily thin branches bend and flex  under the weight
  that is currently being put on them.  Anyone foolish enough to hang
  around up here for an extended amount of time deserves to fall.
