Access Tunnel~
You sneak along the dark, maze-like miasma of tunnels.  You're afraid of
being spotted by the strange metal creatures that act as sentries in these
unfriendly corridors.  Surely they must lead . . . somewhere?

You enter the small air vent, and push yourself along on your hands and knees.
At the other end, you spy the first lighted room so far.  Voices also drift in
from the far opening of the shaft.

Central Housing Chamber~
You tumble out into a huge chamber, roughly the size of a football field.
Conduits and machinery cover the walls and ceiling.  Seven twelve foot view
screens hang suspended from the ceiling, while a bank of a hundred video
monitors fill a portion of one wall, each showing a different part of the
complex.  Lights flash and an occasional synthesized voice or buzzer breaks
the hum of machinery.

ICK, you try to avert your gaze from the hideous blob resting on a massive
pedestal in the middle of the cavernous room.

Systems Service Room~
You climb down into a much smaller room.  A couple computer terminals, two long
conference tables, and a battery of dials, blinking lights, and coded systems
readout boards dominate the 40 X 40 ft room.  On the walls is a plethora of 
indicators, sings and labels that say things like "Temperature Regulator,"
"Lights Level 1-3," "Surveillance Override," "Reactor Modulator," "Computer
Biconvex," "Flux Capacitor," and so on.  Amid all of these, there is a narrow
slot marked "Omnibus Cortex."  Also, hovering above the one of the conference
tables is a small ball of blue light . . . a much smaller version of the Rift
you took to get here.

Limbo~
You pop out on the other side of the rift.  Zounds . . . you're either on drugs
or hanging around in limbo.  The swirls of colors and Bee Gees' music (not to
mention the disco ball) makes you think you are in some kind of cosmic prison.
In fact, the black light lettering, "COSMIC PRISON" confirms your beliefs.
You've got to get out of here, if you hear "Staying Alive" one more time . . .

vanquished.
