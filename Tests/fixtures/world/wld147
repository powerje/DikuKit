Ruinan's Super Hideout!~
   You stare around in this room.  It's pretty dark, and there is a large
control panel set in the middle of the floor with a kazillion switches and
buttons on it.  Curious, you press a button, and to your astonishment, the
far wall rumbles slowly upwards to reveal a thousand television screens
behind!  Each screen shows each player and their actions!  At first you are
disgusted with this blantant violation of privacy but then become intrigued
as you watch some of the players secretly scratching themselves, others 
picking their nose while pretending not to, and others performing even
more bizarre acts that they'd die if anyone else even knew their secrets.
You wonder if Ruinan must have a blackmail racket going on.... and you wonder
what he knows about YOU!

wall walls~
Scrawled all along the walls is some archaic gibberish.  You can barely
make out some few lines.  They go something like this...

We are, we are, we are, we are, we are the Engineers!...
.....we can, we can, we can, we can demolish forty beers....

After that, things get a little blurry understandably...

Along the Meadow Path~
    You walk along yet another path down yet another meadow filled with
lush green grass and colorful flowers.  A sweet aroma permeates the air.
You see a deer nursing its white-speckled doe far off in the distance.
Singing bluebirds sing sweetly as they fly gaily overhead.  You feel
perfectly safe here.  Purple-striped blue bushes line the path.  The
sun is bright.  Eh?  Purple-striped blue bushes?  You take another look.
Damn!  This must be another bug in the mud!

     As you walk along the path, enjoying the scenery (albeit with some
strange bugs), you notice more and more things wrong with the scenery.
The deer is barking, the bluebirds are rapping instead of singing, the
flowers waves happily at you as you walk by, and the sun opens its eyes
and winks at you!  Disturbed, you wonder if your sanity is fading away.

    You feel more and more uneasy as the scenery around you continue to 
deteriorate.  The path constantly changes from ice to dirt to pavement to
cobblestone and so on.  The flowers have unrooted themselves and are now
performing X-rated actions.  The ground slowly rises and falls as if you
were walking across some giant breathing stomach.  The birds laugh at
you as you walk by.  What the hell is going on here?

At a Hole in the Path~
    After some time of walking down the increasingly chaotic path, you
finally come across something interesting.  There is a perfectly round
hole in the path.  You peer cautiously into the hole.  You can't see much,
but you can make out blue glowing lines running parallel to each other
all over the place.  Weird.  What could this be?  You feel the hair on
your back of your neck rise as if charged by electricity.

False Alarm~
    Phew!  That was just another bug in the system, and that death-trap
wasn't for real!  You feel an immense sense of relief as you slide past
it.  Unfortunately, the slide is getting somewhat bouncy, with crackling
exposed wires sticking out from all over the place.  What *IS* this place?
Since there's no way to go back the way you just came, you have no choice
but to plod onwards.....

flashing along blue glowing lines that runs along the walls, floor, and
ceiling.  There are a kazillion square shaped black objects lying on the
floor everywhere, with pins sticking out from them into the floor.  You
also see funny-looking upright disc shaped objects, warped cylindrical
objects, and other bizarre objects scattered all around.  You smell
acrid smoke coming from somewhere though, and you realize something must
be wrong.

precisely, you're inside the MUD's computer!  But how can the inside of

Burnt-Out Hole in the Grid~
    You jump into a hole in the motherboard, and end up standing on the other
side of the grid!  You gasp as you stare around you.  Sparks are flying all
over the place, electrical components zoom overhead, wires thrash around,
and an acrid ozone smell blankets the area.  The shimmering blue parallel
lines flicker wildly around you, humming with electricity.  To the north,
you see a huge dark shape.  To your west is a fat bus cable that stretches
upwards into the void, and to your east comes a weird throbbing sound.

with all their pointy ends facing up to make your feet miserable.  Some
chips are larger than others and some of them twitch slightly, but overall
they all look pretty dead to you.  Just the way they should look.  However,
you spot a fairly larger chip to your west, and one good-sized chip to your
north-east, and a massive chip farther north.

hear the whooshing of air and that weird humming sound.

Riding the Bus Cable!~
    You walk gingerly along a fat bus cable.  It bounces up and down under
your feet, giving you an incredibly queasy feeling.  All these sparks flying
overhead don't help either.  You gulp and swallow and stride gingerly
ahead while dodging flying electrical components.  Resistors, diodes,
transmitters, and capacitors leer horribly at you as they try to knock
you off the cable.  Old and obsolete computers litter this area too.  You
feel sorry for these has-beens.

Riding the Bus Cable!~
    You walk gingerly along a fat bus cable.  It bounces up and down under
your feet, giving you an incredibly queasy feeling.  All these sparks flying
overhead don't help either.  You gulp and swallow and stride gingerly
ahead while dodging flying electrical components.  Resistors, diodes,
transmitters, and capacitors leer horribly at you as they try to knock
you off the cable.  Old and obsolete computers litter this area too.  You
feel sorry for these has-beens.

End of the Bus Cable~
   Phew!  You finally reach the end of the cable and step onto solid
ground again.  Unfortunately, the ground is nothing more than a burnt
sizzling card of some kind and you are forced to hop around franctically
to avoid being electrocuted.  There is still no end to the sheer chaos
all around you as gigantic bugs crawl all over the place eating valuable
and expensive computer materials!  The COMMs sure ain't going to be happy

blue parallel lines that seems to float on nothingness.  You close your

looking machines waiting for you.  They look mean.

Toward the Socket~

main motherboard.  You can see a whole bunch of garbage jammed into the
socket such as paperclips, pins, broken staples, and other metal stuff.
You wince as the metal junk continously short-circuits the card and 
zillions of sparks fly out.  Do you dare go near the sizzling socket and
possibly die?

lead nowhere.  You wince to think of the disastrous effect this must have
in a fragile computer system.  There is one big fat cord of wire here.
Suddenly the cord twitches and you realize it's alive!  Worse yet, you see

with flickering lights all over it.  In the chair sits a huge being, with
wires and electrodes running out of its head up into the ceiling.  This
being is almost unrecognizeable as human through all the cybernetic parts
replacing human parts.  It shivers as electricity crackles around it and
your mind reels at the thought of the trillions of gigabytes passing through
this nexus every nanosecond.  You are filled with awe and wonder if you

are hurled at it and slam against it, the metal bars  digging painfully
into your face and body.  Nonetheless you frantically wrap your arms around
a metal bar and you try to catch your breath.  The air whooshes downwards
and you look down then swallow deeply.  There is a fan down there, spinning
fast and the blades looks awfully sharp.  You can see an exit beyond the
fan, and for a crazy moment you wonder if you could possibly slip between
the fan blades somehow and get to the exit.  You laugh crazily...

   Stepping gingerly over the jumping and hopping chips and resistors, you
peer ahead into the horizon, but you see nothing.  The floor stretches
out into the dark infinity of space.  A blue glow eerily lights up the
room.  The chittering and clattering of the chips slowly drives you insane.

In Front of a Mysterious Globe~
    Phew!  You've finally made your way through that tangled mess of wires
and now stand in a mysterious place.  Looming over you is a huge mysterious
globe, and you can see a strand of fibre optic line above you that reaches
into the globe.  The globe's shell is metallic silver and reflects everything
around it so perfectly that you can't even see the smoky gray visible in
all mirrors.  It looks more like a distortion in space... wait.. it IS a
distortion in space!  What the hell is this doing inside a computer?
Looking around you, you see four straight wires leading away from you into
the mysterious distance.   You wonder where they lead to.

They stick to your clothes and wallet, mooching money from you!  They
scream at you to buy them and all their upgrades, and don't worry about the
price or the bugs!  Just buy them!  You are revolted at these hideous

disgust as you catch sight of the unsightly softwares that threaten to
invade computers world-wide.... and your eyes falls upon the biggest nasty
of them all:  Bill Gates!  This horrid rich freak is plotting to overthrow
the world by draining every last cent from the world into his own bank

around you, the tapes twitch as you pass by them.  You feel uneasy at
the thought of tapes wrapping around your throat, strangling you....
But instead, you only see large DAT tapes hovering in fear in the back
of the room, but they won't let you pass to see what they're scared of.
Perhaps they're trying to protect you?  Strange....

this is an incredibly powerful magnet, and it's so powerful that even
you feel the magnetic pulse pulling at you!  No telling how much chaos
will be caused if this were allowed to erase every single back-up tape,
hard drive, and floppy on the mud computer!  You shiver at the thought
and grimly prepare to hack it apart.

and they are filled with nothing but binary numbers.  In the floor, you
can see a hole lined with binary numbers that slowly turns into hexadecimal
numbers as the hole runs deeper.  Guarding this hole, you see HUGE 0's

there is an odd sense of uniformity to the distortions... suddenly you
realize you're in a spherical shaped room with 16 facets!  Curious.  You
also see one VERY frustrated looking person standing here, and he looks like
he's packing up.  You realize that this is Unknown, the COMM member and it
looks like he's giving up and quitting the mud!  However, you must get
the password to his account if you're to fix the mud code!  He sees you,
pales as he realizes he's been discovered, then snarls.  Uh-oh.

fight against the urge to take a deep breath and drown.  Before you is
a huge fuse box, with the fuses in it exploding as electrical arcs surge
from fusehole to fusehole.  You'd better do something to stop this before
the entire computer blows up into a mushroom cloud!

   You gasp in astonishment as you stare around you.  There are numerous
shiny polygon shaped objects floating about you, and each object continuously
morphs into new shapes.  One starburst morphs into a shiny silver sphere
as it spins past you.  All around you, there are fractal plasma colors
flowing softly.  This world is extremely sharp and colorful.  You
reach out and your hand seems to stretch infinitely long.  Your stomach
churns and wish you were on solid ground again.  Ahead of you, a stationary
prism blocks your way.  You turn around but the prism moves so that it is
always in front.  Looks like this thing won't let you escape!

merges into smoking circuitry and reality seems to flicker on and off.
You finally see the ultimate horror:  AN UNREPEATABLE BUG!  This
hideous being is here, inserting even more bugs and absurd code into the
mud, and ripping out wires and circuits all over the place.  An ozone
smell permeates the area as you can see severely damaged circuitry through
the holes in reality.  Those blue shimmering lines are no longer neatly
parallel; they all crisscross over each other!  Ouch, no telling what 
damage that would do!
Kill this bug and put an end to this chaos!
