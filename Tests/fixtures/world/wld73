HERO's TESTING GROUNDS~
You have just been transferred into a huge indoor combat room.  As you
peer around the room, you notice that it is very damp and dark.  As your
eyes adjust to the darkness, you notice that your light source begins to
flicker on and off.  On the floor, you notice blood and bones everywhere.
Broken weapons, armor, and potion bottles are scattered all over the floor.
There are no exits here therefore you can not flee.  To be a HERO you must
be among the bravest in Midgaard, thus fleeing can not be an option for
you. You must embrace Death with Dignity!
From the looks of things, you guess that many combats have occured here
and that many creatures have died here.  Now you know that it's your 
turn to DIE or to SURVIVE.  To Die means Failure.  To Survive means
you are worthy to be a HERO.
Good Luck!

THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE~

You are in a room filled with various machines and computers, they look like
some sort of stock price quotation devices.  The floor here is covered with
all kinds of papers, some say BUY some say SELL on it.  This place is a real
mess. It looks like a thousand people have trampled these floors for the 
entire day.  As you look further, you notice a figure slumped over in the dark
corner. As you walk closer, you notice he is in a fetal position.  He shivers
and shakes as you approach him.  You ask him his name.  He answers :
I am Gordon Gekko, stock broker extrodinare, and this is what i look like
after a day at the office.

As you peer around, you see one of the most used exits here at the exchange.
The WINDOW.  You feel the urge to jump out of it.  It's only a 150 foot drop...
straight down to the Temple of Midgaard.

  Good equipment is a vital part of the game.  Some equipment will improve
your armor class, some your mana, movement, or hit points. Most pieces of
equipment give some type of special ability.  To find out what a certain
piece of equipment does, you can use a scroll of identification on it.
Some equipment is aligned, you must be evil, netural, or good in order to
wear or use them.  Your alignment changes when you kill certain
types of monsters (or also called MOBS).  If you kill good mobs you will 
become more evil, and if you kill evil mobs you will become more good.

  In case you are not able to flee, you may (if you are fast enough) try
to use a Scroll of Recall (which you can purchase at the magic shop) to
transport yourself to the Temple of Midgaard.  You do not have to hold the
Scroll of Recall in order to use it.  You just need to have it in your
inventory (but not within a container or a bag).  Some mobs will be able to
destroy your scroll in battle so be careful and make sure you still have
it when you recall.

Wimpy~
 
  A good idea is to set your Wimpy.  Wimpy will automatically make you
flee in a battle when you reach a certain hit point.  For example, if you
have 20 hit points total and you want to flee from you opponent when you
reach 10 hit points you would type :  WIMPY 10.  Remember that when you flee from an opponent after you are engaged in a battle, you will loose some
expierence points.

even some Players.  You will not be able to see these things if you don't
have some sort of detect invisibility spell, potion, or object. The simpliest
way to see invisible objects and people is to goto the Magic Shop in town and
buy a Yellow Potion.  This will allow you to see invisible things for a
certain amount of time. If you are invisible and you try to buy something at
the shops, the shop keepers will not do business with you.

Grouping with other Players~
 
  One of the most enjoyable things here is grouping. This is when you
and other players band together to fight or explore. When you are low
level, it is best to group with others so that you will not be killed as
easily.  You can only group with people who are NO MORE or NO LESS then 15
levels above or below you. Once you are part of a group, you will gain
expierence as you kill Mobs.  The expierence you gain will be less then
if you killed the Mob yourself, but your chances of dying are less and you
can kill harder mobs. Try to form a group with all four classes. To find a
group to join use the gossip channel. You simply type :gossip Does anyone
want to GROUP?????? Some players should respond to this request.  If no one
does then try again later.

Death Traps~
 
  In your many explorations you will probably run into a DEATH TRAP.
If you hit a DT. You will DIE and loose all your eq.  There will be NO
reimbursements for lost eq in a DT.  Therefore, try not to hit these
things. Most of the DT's will kill you instantly, but there are some
which will allow you to fly over them thus avoiding death.  You must
be wearing a piece of eq which will allow you to fly or have a fly
spell cast on you.  However, try to avoid ALL Dt's if you can.  One way
you can detect DT's is by using a thief's PEEK ability.  Simply peek to the
direction you wish to go. Peek more than once in case you fail! This is
one good reason to group.  Remember when you are in a new area, peek first
before entering into a room.

Donations & Sacrificing~
 
  There is a Donation room located in town where players can donate
equipment for others.  Please refer to the map for location. As a new

see if there is any useful equipment you can get. As you get more equipment
through your many adventures, you can donate some of you stuff to others.
To do this you type : Don (item).  This will automatically donate the
item directly to the donation room.  You do not have to Be in the Donation
room to donate.  Please Don't fill the donation room with Useless items.
If you want to get rid of an item PERMANENTLY you can sacrifice it to the
Gods.  Any item you sacrifice will be GONE!! So be careful when you do this.
You can sacrifice an item by typing :  Sac (item)

The Outlook over the City of Midgaard~
 
  You are standing on a ledge overlooking the Great city.  As you
look down, you see many people walking through the streets of the city.
You see small shops scattered along the city walls. The aroma of freshly
baked bread is in the air. There is a Sign on a post here.
 
There is a path leading down to the city from here.

               Go now YOUNG ONE!
 
  Go explore for a while in the city.  Remember to use your map.
When you are ready, go to the ROOM above the Temple of Midgaard.
Once there go SOUTH to the Battle Field. There is an area which
I have created to help you sharpen your fighting skills and to
gain some experience points. Remember ALL that I have taught you.
 
Good Luck!!!

notice there is a small Sign posted at it's base.
 
The exit to the city is to the North of you.
