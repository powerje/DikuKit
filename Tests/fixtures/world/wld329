{B,BO} A bridge over a moat~

    {CYAN,BO}The bridge here is about one hundred meters long and
    only about ten meters wide.  At the end of the bridge is
    a VERY large gate.  Maybe you should avoid the front 
    entrance and find a back way into the castle.

{B,BO} Walking around the castle {b,bo}~

    {CYAN,BO}There's high castle walls on one side and a moat 
    filled with god-knows-what on the other side.
    The walkway is about 3 feet wide between these
    two, and you're having trouble balancing.  Not
    a good idea to slip!

    {CYAN,BO}This is the main gate of Osaka Castle, it's only about
    ten feet wide and ten feet tall.  There are turrets on
    either side of it, for samurai to shoot arrows at invaders
    from a safe distance.  For the first time you notice the
    walls of the castle arn't many rocks pulled togeather,
    rather LARGE slabs of rock that have been cut and placed
    in precise fashion.

{B,BO} In the Yard {b,bo}~

    {CYAN,BO}A yard for the japaneese is much like a park for
    Americans.  It's a large field with grass and trees,
    but it has a practical purpose with the Japaneese.
    It doubles as a training area for samurai, and for
    demonstrations or competitions.  It looks like there
    is a archers competition going on today.

    he comes to Osaka, he stays for a couple
    of months to recoporate from the long Journey.
    The house is almost like a small castle,
    it uses wood for walls, which is unheard of
    for most houses.  There are multiple floors
    and the outside is lavishly decorated with
    gold and jems.
