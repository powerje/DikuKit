at the stages around you. You cant quite make out what they are looking

  There is a seedy looking guy with a hat and a cane and you listen
to him spew out his list of one liners to try and lure you to enter.

   You drop the big elbow on someone standing in front of you and watch
as they slither to the ground. There! Now you can see better..
Before you on stage stands a man. Not an ordinary man but a man standing
10 feet tall! His arms seem to be able to stretch in all directions 
which seems to be the main reason why he is on stage. He sorta reminds
you a bit of Forge in the way that he pals around with the audience 
while his other hand is reaching around their backs for their wallets!
  You remember the last time you spoke to Forge and suddenly grab for
your wallet as you know all about his kind..

   After mushing the head of yet another zombie to the ground, You now
can see clearly what they are gazing at. Before you on stage you
witness a freak of nature! A large overflowing Pudding of a woman
sits on what can only be described as a chair with shock-absorbers.
But wait, this isnt what grabs your attention first. You notice the
woman has a hair leading from her chest to her beard and you quiver
to think about where else on her body this hairy adventure leads to!
  You are just about to hurl when you notice something very familiar
about this woman. Seems without the beard she could almost be a dead
ringer for LSD! Her facial expressions are almost identical and you start
to realize that perhaps the genepool of LSD's isnt as pure as you 
once thought it was. You pull out your wallet size autographed picture
of LSD and keep looking back and forth between the two... Amazing!

its destination is still straight to the east. In the distance you

You are frightened but your adventurous side is also curious to see

   You find yourself staring up at a rather large man with a rather large
knife tucked away in his belt. He seems pleased to see you and you can
tell by the smirk on his face that it was no accident you took that
joy ride into his hut! In one hand you see a deck of cards, in the other
hand you see a fat cigar. His teeth are moldy yellow, his earwax seems
to be a phenomenom much like Old Faithful, and his crusty toenails give
new meaning to the word toe jam! Your surroundings are pretty much nill,
the traditional 2 chairs and 1 table is all you get and the inside looks
like the walls have been turned a yellowish brown by the number of cigars
this man smokes. Its clear he wants 1 thing and 1 thing only, to remove
you from your gold! You look for the exit, and notice you are in trouble!

impressed! Instead of the usual 2 chairs and a table you've seen in 
the other tents this place has a coffee table and a rather small couch that
could barely fit 2 people...
  Sitting on the couch is a small thin fragile looking man. He has a flower
in his hair and is rubbing the couch beckoning you to sit next to him.
Now you understand the surrounding area and why that couch is so small!
The coffee table has tarrot cards on it and you feel a con game coming

but attached to the body are two seperate necks with individual heads!
You overhear their conversation with eachother and notice that they
are arguing. It seems they are blaming eachother for being the "ugly head"
of the body and are blaming eachother for being the reason why they never
pick up at bars. They remind you of Primer and Caveman and you just wanna

that would make the devil sweat... well, at least from the backside.
She appears to be dressed in skintight leather, and you can hear the
crack of a whip in front of her. Also, you can hear small whimpers die
down, probably because she whipped her last victim into submission. She turns

it seems pretty barren otherwise. On stage is a boy resembling a wolf.
His sad puppy dog eyes remind you of Armitage and you feel the urge
o go and pet him. While you do so you realize why this area is not very
crowded as you feel the wolf-boy pissing on your leg. Looking up and
cursing the gods you notice another similarity to Armitage as the wolf
boy starts humping your leg. After an hour of chasing the boy around the
stage you realize you'll never catch him and give up.

take his spot.
  In front of you lies a hulking creature of muscles! His chest is so big
you could stick quarters between the clevage. He effortlessly moves large
objects around the stage and you start to remember the last time SMASH did
similar acts of strength before your eyes. Hey, he even has a sack of EQ.
just like SMASH's! You wonder if the two are related, and after a while
you hope they are not as you fear the fact that you are standing on his
foot would bring his rage upon you.

someone's personal space in the big top. You get this feeling because
standing right in front of you is a massive clown soaking his abnormally
sized feet in a tub. He turns to you, reaches for an abnormally sized
pie, and says "SHOWTIME!". You DON'T wanna see this act.

  As you enter the room you feel unoriented, probably due to the fact 
that you can't see the floor you are walking on. A thick layer of mist
and fog blankets the floor on which you are walking on. You feel ground
beneath your feet yet it does not feel quite as solid as you would hope
a normal floor to be. The evil aura of this room makes you quiver and
the glop your walking on makes you wanna check your shoes to see if you
have stepped in something. Your dizziness almost overcomes you as you
search for what lies at the end of this path.

Upon inspection though you notice nobody else seems to be beating down the
doors to ride this thing. You also don't see an exit and wonder if this is
one of those "One way" deals. Only one way to find out eh? Don't walk by,
give it a try! You see some little midget laughing at you while holding a lever.
You also see a large spooky haunted house to the east, nobody is out
front to greet the newcommers though.. Wonder why?

   Now that was the most satisfying thing you've done in a long while. You
re-enter the cart, remove the wedge and let the ride continue......
At least NOW you can relax and enjoy yourself.

{bo,G}The ride slowly comes to a hault as it passes through the exit...{bo}~
Slumped down in your cart, blood gushing out of your wounds, you wish you
has never encountered this blasted ride. The cart slowly strolls past
zombie onlookers and into the entrance from where you began! Words echo in
your head "Don't tell the others about this, let them learn themselves!"

{BO,C}Along the haunted path{bo}~
   You are walking along a creepy path enroute to a large mansion. The
cloud formation hovers over the mansion and you see lightning streak
across the sky. Numb passers-by walk to and fro but still the same expression
remains, one of a glazed over mentaly ill person.

{bo,G}Entrance to the {Y,BO}Wax Museum{bo}~
   You have arrived at the entrance to a large mansion. You see two very 
large wax figurines holding massive axes standing guard at the entrance.
You see people walking into and out of the mansion with relative
ease and you feel confident that you can do the same. As you turn around
to glance at your surroundings you could swear you saw one of the wax 
figurines move, or perhaps twitch. Your feeling of ease fades and you 
are now on guard for what this mansion my have in store...

{bo,C}Inside the mansion{bo}~
   As you step through the doors you see a red carpet which leads
from one entranceway to the other. Along this red carpet stand wax figures
of all kind, ugly and fiendish but all are scary. Walking past each gives
you an uncomfortable feeling of being watched, You spin around quick
to try and catch anything watching you but you fail to turn up any
evidence. You blood gets colder and a chill runs up your spine.

{bo,C}Inside the mansion{bo}~
   You follow the red carpet as it leads down the center of the room, eyes
still upon you, you walk and spin around every few seconds to ease your
sense of danger. A large wax figure stands over a terrified woman who is
huddled into a ball beneath him. the figure wields a large axe which is 
bearing down upon the woman and you thank the heavens this is only a wax 
dummy. You continue to keep an eye out for any danger.

{bo,C}Inside the mansion{bo}~
   This room is very dark, you can barely see 2 feet in front of you
and your nerves are dancing the lambada on you. You spin nervously in all
directions trying to ensure yourself that all is ok but your gut knows
otherwise.

{bo,C}Along a dark hallway{bo}~
   Your heart now racing, you beg for the exit out of this nightmare. The
hallway is long and dark with wax figurines lining along each side of a
red carpet. You slowly walk down the path spinning wildly, and exptecting
death, almost wishing for death so this madness could end!!

{bo,C}Along a dark hallway{bo}~
   You pull out a teal of tripple cure and hold it securely in your hands.
The corridor before you is VERY dark and as you creep down its path you
think of yet another troubling thing, what if there are thieves in here?!
You check your money pouch and feel along the walls, hoping for an exit.

{bo,C}Mansion hallway{bo}~
   All along the sides of this room are wax figurines which were probably
placed here to scare you into insanity. You think of the great job the
designer did as you grasp for your last bit of sanity. walking down the
red carpeting you clench your tripple cure teal tightly in your hand and 
slowly creep along, occasionally spinning around to see if anyone is there.

{Y,BO}Large Domed Room{bo}~
   This room opens into a vast area where a large table rests surrounded by
wax figures which circle the table. The dome is filled with portraits of 
the most cruel people to have walked the land, with pictures of mad men now
long gone. You shiver to see their faces painted on a dome as if to praise
them and their madness. You notice an opening at the end of the room and
your heart pounds as you start to imagine what lies ahead.

{BO,R}Hall of Shame{bo}~
   Your jaw drops when enter this room. All along the sides of the walls 
are wax figurines which resemble all the madmen you witnessed atop the
large dome in the adjacent room. You notice all these mad men in
their killer stances but you notice them all surrounding one particular 
mad man. In the middle of the room stands a simple man, yet not just any
ordinary man. This man was once known as the Gestapo! Terrorizor of all
mortals and Immortals alike, he was best known for antagonizing his
victims to the point of suicide. The mere mentioning of his name makes 
tiny school children run, you stand in total terror of him even after
knowing he is just a wax figure. You attempt to count the number of immorts
he has sent fleeing from the mud and you weep for their departure.
