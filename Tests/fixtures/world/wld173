{W}A Peaceful Road{w}~
     It's a pleasant day as you walk through the wooded countryside,
soaking up sunshine that filters through the leaves overhead. The
forest is clamoring around you as the birds in the trees call to each
other and small animals chirp shrilly at your passing. The gentle
scraping of armor as you walk is the harshest sound you've heard all
day.

{W}The Road Continues..{w}~
     Without warning, a thick white fog closes in and blots out the
sun. The entire forest falls absolutely silent, as if a sudden dread
has clasped it by the throat and squeezed. First the trees in the
distance are lost to view, and the those within a few feet disappear
into the heavy mist. The sudden quiet weighs upon you like a deadly 
menace just over your shoulder.

     The towering trees whose tops are lost in heavy gray mist block
out all but a pallid light. The tree trunks almost touch. The thick
damp undergrowth presses in on you, making it impossible even to see
one another at times. The woods have the silence of a forgotten grave,
yet they exude the feeling of an unsounded scream.
     The path forks here leading both east and west.

     You stand upon a overlook jutting several yards

the bone.  Your hands become almost numb against the
cold steel of your weapon.  At the overlooks edge sits
a small elven woman cradling a cloth as if she were 
cradling a child.  Her skin is black as coal, gleaming 
as if it were cut from the starry night sky.  Her long
white hair floats wildly about her body blowing in the
night wind.  Were it not for the hair, she would nearly
fade into the darkness.  Tears well in her eyes and 
stream down her cheeks like the wax from a sputtering 
candle.  She whispers pitifully, "Tell me- where is 
my child?"

{BO,BL}The Horseman's Domain{bo,bl}~
     The rumble of hoofbeats turns to thunder, as if an entire cavalry
unit is charging headlong at you. Through the mists you see him - a
black rider, solid as yourselves and not the least bit ghostly. Were
it not for his missing head, you would assume him to be flesh and 
blood.
     He is astride a great black steed, with hooves that flash with
fire when they strike the ground, and eyes that are wild and eerily 
white. The beast's ebony nostrils are flared, and they blast puffs of 
smoke. The teeth are bared in a grin, the lips pulled back by the 
sawing and jerking of the reins.
     The rider is a large man, dressed in silver and black. His dark
high-collared cloak billows behind him. His ebony boots gleam in the
faint moonlight. His left arm holds the reins, drawn taut. His right 
arm, raised high and straight, carries a huge, shining sickle.

     The woods here are dark and sinister.  Gnarled,
     dead trees seem to outnumber those that cling
     to life.  Stinging insects become at first only
     a nuisance then a plague, and the air becomes
     bitter.  There can be no doubt that the forest
     has been corrupted by a great evil.  The only
     mystery is the identity of the malevolent being
     who rules this place.

{BL}DarkWood Forest{bl}~

     The woods here are dark and sinister.  Gnarled,
     dead trees seem to outnumber those that cling
     to life.  Stinging insects become at first only
     a nuisance then a plague, and the air becomes
     bitter.  There can be no doubt that the forest
     has been corrupted by a great evil.  The only
     mystery is the identity of the malevolent being
     who rules this place.

     Every step through this dark forest is a great
     challenge, requiring you to deal with clawing
     shrubs, uneven ground, and swarms of stinging
     insects.  Here and there one can spot the ground
     but the greatest part of the ground is covered
     by vines and undergrowth.
