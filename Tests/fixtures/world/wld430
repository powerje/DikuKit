  that appear to be hewn from the tunnel.  The rocks and

{Y}The Desert Sands{y}~

  Having plunged deep into the Sanc Kingdom in pursuit of
  Quatre Rababa Winner, you find yourself in a vast desert.
  You are surrounded by sand in every direction you look.
  The sun beats down relentlessly, quickly dehydrating
  you. Lost and tired, you aimlessly wander on, hoping to
  find shelter before your water runs out.

{Y}Quicksand!!!{y}~

  As you move forwards, you get the wierd sensation
  that you are getting shorter. Suddenly, you realize
  that it is because you are sinking into the ground!
  Too late you notice the dried bones of animals around
  you. The quicksand sucks you downwards relentlessly,
  and the more you struggle the deeper you sink. Slowly,
  it smothers you...

{Y}A Desert Ravine{y}~

  You have finally made it out of the desert,
  and into the welcome shade of a ravine. On
  either side of you tower huge granite spires.
  Suddenly, the ground before you bursts from
  the impact of a laser beam. It's an ambush!

{Y}Sanc Kingdom Desert Base{y}~

  As you come out of the ravine, you are amazed to see
  an entire base spread out before you. This must be
  the mobile suit base of the Sanc Kingdom. Swarms of
  mobiles suits are now swooping down towards you. Looks
  like you'll have to fight your way in.

{W,BO}The Ice Shelf{w,bo}~
 
  {W,BO}You find yourself on the edge of a vast, frozen wasteland.
  Your back is to the briny sea, so there is no way to go 
  but forward.  A path leads away from the ice and fades
  into a whirling snowstorm.

{W,BO}The Whirling Snowstorm{w,bo}~
 
  {W,BO}You wander around aimlessly, searching for a clue as to which
  way you should go.  The ice and snow blows in your face as 
  the wind howls in your ears.
  
  Despite the frigid conditions, there are still dangerous 
  creatures lurking about.  The scent of warm flesh draws them
  out of their dens in search of food.

  You wander into an icy cave.  Your breath is bitter cold as
  you scan the surroundings for signs of life.
  
  If you listen carefully, there are other sounds in the cave
  beside the howling of the winds off the glacier.  But what
  kind of sounds?

{C,BO}The Foot of the Glacier{c,bo}~
  {W,BO}
  After a narrow escape from a vicious blizzard, you find yourself 
  at the foot of an enormous barren sheet of ice.
  
  You realize that you cannot go back through the snowstorm, so the
  only way to go is up.  There is a path cut over the glacier, but
  it is narrow and treacherous.

  beyond your sight in all directions, except to the east 
  where you see a ravine cut into the surface.
  
  This narrow pass decends below your line of sight.
