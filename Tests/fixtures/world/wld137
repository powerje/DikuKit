Before the Great Tree~

  You find yourself standing beneath a giant tree in the forest.  The large
  branches and deep green leaves shade you as you rest in the shadow of one
  of the largest trees you have ever seen.

Inside the Tree~

  You emerge in a large wooden fortress with bark and leaves everywhere.
  You can see the walls of the tree extend above you as far as you can see.
  The dark brown walls encircle you, and as you survey the area, you notice
  that the bowels of the tree are so immense that you can barely make out
  the other side of the trunk.

On a Small Limb~

  You make your way up to a thicker point on the limb.  Here, the limb
  has widened enough to allow you to stand comfortably.  The blue sky
  overhead has a comforting effect, and you begin to feel at ease in this
  high up place.

The Tip of the Limb~

  You are standing on a thin limb that juts out on the south end of
  the tree.  To the south you see only forest and more forest.  The limb
  sways in the breeze and feels very unstable.

A Giant Limb Leading North~

  You embark on a journey to the north, stepping lightly on the tree's
  branches and limbs as you walk slowly in this direction.  The limb that
  you stand on now seems to be large enough to march an army across.  As
  you walk you whistle a soft tune to yourself in an effort to ignore the
  dizzying height.

Under a Treehouse~

  You stand below a small treehouse that seems to be built on a fork
  in the tree.  As you gaze up you notice a lone window looking out
  of the south side of the house.  A pair of green eyes glare out of
  the window in your direction and you feel cold in your bones.

The Entrance to the Treehouse~

  You climb an old ladder made of bones and animal skins and approach
  a large opening in the treehouse.  You can hear shuffling noises above
  you and despite your utter fear, you feel that you must satisfy your
  curiosity and find out what is dwelling here so far above the world
  that you live in.

Inside the Treehouse~

  You enter a large room filled with various odds and ends that a tree
  dweller might need to survive.  There are ropes and other climbing
  apparatus on the walls, and a gigantic can of bug spray lies on the
  ground at your feet.  You hear loud voices from the north.

Inside the Treehouse~

  You enter an intersection in the treehouse.  You can either go back the
  way you came, or choose one of the other directions in your quest for
  wealth, power, and untold adventure.  You hear voices from the west,
  and from the east you see only blackness.
  A large vine grows out of the floor and twists into the shape of a sign.

Twiggy's Sanctum~

  You enter a gigantic chamber bathed in flourescent light emanating from
  a sconce in the far wall.  The light flickers, throwing shadows across the
  floor.  The voices are loud now, but you cannot seem to make out where in
  the room they are coming from.  Out of the corner of your eye you see one
  of the shadows take a flying leap towards you!
