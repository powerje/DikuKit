  Even as dark as it is in this area,
  you can still see the outline of
  the White Lotus Temple.  But
  you'd have to be able to get pass the
  two huge guards standing here before
  you can proceed any further.

{BOLD}{BLACK}Inside the {BOLD}{WHITE}White Lotus Temple{white}~

  After being surrounded by total darkness for
  such a long time, even the dim torch lighting
  , you look around and notice an intersection 
  not too far north. You take two steps
  north and suddenly freeze in your tracks as 
  you can begin to sense the feeling of pure
  surrounding you. Maybe you should think 
  twice about going any further.
