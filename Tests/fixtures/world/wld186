   Various gadgets and machines lie all over the lab. A
   four foot tall aging man is bent over one of his
   machines. Obviously, whatever is in the adjoining lab
   is a secret because the man won't let you back there.

{R}The {BO,R}Altar{bo,r}~

   Ea sits crosslegged on the altar with an easel in
   front of him.  He is painting the most beautiful
   picture you have ever seen.  Ea is so caught up in his
   painting that he doesn't even notice you, but his
   priests sure do!

   Gilgamesh deflowers the brides of the city. To the

   dressing himself for the day, but he has only gotten
   his pants on so far. It looks like a good time to jump

{G}Cedar {BO,G}Forest{bo,g}~

   The leaves of the ancient cedar trees block most of
   the light from entering the forest. You can barely see
   the lithe forms of the Annunaki Elders among the
   cedars, and the trees themselves seem to move in a
   peculiar dance.

{Y}Sunlit {C}Clearing{c}~

   The god of the sun stands before you, blinding you
   with his glory.  To the east, you see a temple that
   could only be found in heaven.  However, looking at
   the menacing sun god, you don't think he'll let
   you in.

{BO,C}Outside the Gates of Uruk{bo,c}~

   BANG!! You jump as the gates slam behind you. You
   notice something to the west, and decide to take a
   closer look. Looks like that's the only way to go.

   Despite the lush grass and the abundance of water, you
