  {C}over the throne rests {BO}{B}an elderly looking Dragon. He looks very upset{b}
  {C}by your presence.  {BO}{B}Before you have time to turn and leave he stands{b}

A Small Hidden Chamber~


  These dragons will seriously kick your ass.  Yeah, I said ass.  There
  was no other room description in here, but after fighting these guys with
  my mortals I was like, holy shit, these are some tough fricken little
  dragons.  Anyway, why the heck are you still reading this?   Maybe you 
  scrolled back because your dead.  haha... oh well...   -Z

Before the Limb~

  {G}You are standing on a small cypress limb. From this height you can see
  the bottom of the marsh more clearly.  Large crocodiles and alligators
  float in the putrid marsh awaiting their next meal.   The sun is still
  well hidden by the thick foliage, so it makes your climb more difficult{g}.
