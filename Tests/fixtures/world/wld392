In the foothills of the {WHITE,BOLD}Olympics{white,bold}.~
{GR}
  Walking through the foothills, the {WH,BO}Olympic
  Mountains{wh,bo}{GR} appear as ponderous peaks in the
  distance.  The peaks are snowcapped year-
  round.  The tallest peak is Mt. {WH,BO}Olympus{wh,bo}{GR},
  which stands at 7976 feet tall.  It was 
  named when spotted by a mariner in 1788.  
  This mountain is the focal point of every
  trail in the {WH,BO}Olympics{wh,bo}{GR}, because it is the
  ultimate destination for every hiker.

  group of Sasquatch!  Good thing they are all 
  sleeping, otherwise you would probably be in
  some deep **** right now.  They don't look

In one of the {RED,BOLD}Hot {BLUE,BOLD}Springs{blue,bold}.~
{BLA,BO}
  The smell of sulfur is quite strong here,
  that is because the water in this pool 
  circulates down through cracks in the
  earth to get warmed before coming back up.
  There are a few people in this pool, naked 
  hippies!

In the largest of the {RED,BOLD}Hot {BLUE,BOLD}Springs{blue,bold}.~

  You have just entered the largest hot spring you
  have ever seen.  It looks to be about the size 
  of a 20-person hottub.  The smell of {BLACK,BOLD}Sulfur{black,bold} here
  is almost overpowering, it makes your eyes water 
  and your nose burn.  This pool seems to be about 
  6 feet deep at the center, the water is a bit 
  murky, which is probably a good thing when you 
  see who is in this pool already.  
  On the far side of the pool are more of those 
  naked Hippies!  You feel you need to do the 
  world a favor and rid it of these Hippies who
  don't seem to get it through their heads that no 
  one wants to see them naked.
