Clear waters surround you as you move within the darkened lake. Small 
fish swim around quickly. The contours of the lake's bottom are not 
too extreme fortunately. You should have no trouble walking along the 
bottom, but how long can you hold your breath!?

On the shoreline~

The water seems clear as glass.  The reflections from the water seems
to put you in a trance.  The sands of the beach seem to strecth on
for miles.  Where are you?  Have you walked far?  Everything looks so
peaceful and is clouding your head.  Something must be wrong, because
it looks like you have just seen a fish with arms and legs in the water.
Maybe you should go investigate.

already dark land. Wait, could it be? It looks like a beam of 
sunlight emerging from the east. A large range of mountains stands 
before you. You must have walked twenty miles in one night!

Before Atlas City~

A marble covered iron wall stretches for miles in both directions. The 
front gate looks more like a small fortress than an entrance. Soldiers 
are pacing at the top of the guard gate and along the towering walls. 
Interesting, there is only one guard visible in front of the outer 
gate. Perhaps he could provide some valuable information on how to 
enter this gargantuan city.

Granite stone walls flank you on all sides. Arrow slits above you make 
you realize that these soldiers could kill you at any time. Shouting 
voices emerge from above, cheering on the cities proven guards. The 
smell of boiling oil seeps down through the ceiling's arrow slits and 
makes you sick to the stomach. At least the soft ground should provide 
some decent traction.

with an enormous gate. There no longer is a ceiling, and you can see 
the soldiers waving and cheering from the battlements. The wall before 
you is pure iron, but it has been covered in a majestic marble. Some 
formidable foes stand ready before you. These look to be seasoned 
veterans. The tremendous ovation shakes the very earth on which you 
walk! A huge sign has been posted above the gate. In golden letters, 
the words ATLAS CITY can be seen! They shine in the morning sunlight 
with a holy grace. This is it! Buck up people! VENI VIDI VICI!

With the gates flung open, you walk exhausted, but triumphant into the 
sacred city archway. The wall extends for miles in both directions. 
Ornate columns have been carved into the walls. Magical balls of light 
illuminate the passageway. Before you, the glorious sunlight reflects 
off of what must be a city street or courtyard. You can't help but 
smile to yourself. This is it, the legendary ATLAS CITY. It's a feat 
in itself just to be accepted here. You will forever walk with a 
higher air of confidence knowing that you have entered the mightiest 
city in the empire.

a wall 35 feet thick and 40 stories tall. As you walk within this
mighty fortification, you notice the subtle pleasantries that abound. 
Fine Persian rugs, overstuffed armchairs and golden wine containers 
litter the halls. I guess foreign dignitaries could be welcomed just
as nicely without ever allowing then into the actual city.

as you emerge at the top. This must be one of the archers' towers near 
the front gate. You can see the top of the wall clearly now, as it 
rolls over the emerald green countryside. There must be legions of 
soldiers pacing the walls. It would be absolutely insane to attack 
this place.

If marble tiled streets were not already enough, some patron has 
carved every curb out of pure alabaster. Several shoppes of all kinds 
line both sides of the street. Not even a spec of filth can be seen 
anywhere. There must be some sort of magical garbage disposal in this 
city. It doesn't look like there are any beggars or homeless 
individuals either. What a nifty place.

The Halls of Food~

An entire building devoted as a pantry? What is this place? Mighty oak 
shelves have been bolted to the granite floor and the marble ceiling. 
Each shelf holds a multitude of various foods. Fruits, wines, 
vegetables, sweets and baking goods are everywhere. A magical freezer 
has been created to hold the meat items. There must be at least 50 
different types of meat! When they feast here, they must really eat 
well. You might want to snoop around and see if someone will fix you 
some nice nourishment.

Interesting, a small side room has been constructed deep within the 
storage building. A stone staircase twists upward... You didn't see 
those guards at first. What the heck is going on here? Wait! The sign 
on the wall says "ROYAL TREASURE TOWER"! Now this is a place you would 
want to check out.

The Prince's Private Chamber~

This small tower room must have been added on after the original 
structure was built. It consists of heavy wooden floors and plain 
stone masonry. A comfortable couch has been brought in, however, as 
well as a medium dining table. A few mahogany chairs surround the 
table, and one of them is occupied!

Rodimus' Dungeon~

You come crashing into a dark, damp room. The air smells moldy. You 
can feel wet straw under your feet. This is definitely one of the most 
unpleasant holes in Atlas City. A water pipe drips slowly onto the 
cracked granite floor. An iron gate can be seen at the back of the 
room. Whoa, an older looking man in very expensive armor is looking 
right at you with a cold unwavering gaze. He must be the veteran of 
all veterans.

The inside of this enormous tower is covered in soot. It appears as if 
someone has been using some sort of fire magic here. A creature 
covered in blue hair stands before you. He looks an awful lot like a 
werewolf, but a strange twinkle in his eye tells you otherwise. His 
weak armor pales in comparison to his giant muscles. This is not 
someone you'd want to mess with.

Second story of the large tower~

As you hoist yourself into the room, you notice a large table with the 
skeletal remains of some sort of humanoid creature. Unfortunately, the 
remains are in such poor condition, that you could never recognize the 
race. As you move your eyes from the table, you gasp at all the 
terrible sights around you. Mutilated animal pieces of all sorts line 
endless shelves along the wall. Decapitated heads hang from the 
ceiling and stare at you with lifeless eyes. This looks like the 
laboratory of a necromancer, or at least someone who practices the 
worst forms of dark magic.

placed neatly on a shelf to the east. A box of perfect gems has been 
placed in a shining sphere of light. These stones must have been used 
to create some powerful healing pendants.

pitch black. A great evil is here, or has been here recently. It might 
be a good idea to turn around now. The evil is so thick, that it seems 
to condense onto your skin and creep through your veins.

manner within the room. A library's worth of books line every inch of 
the circular room. A large writing table leans against the western 
wall. The ceiling seems to be pulsating with an odd magical force. A 
spiral staircase winds its way up to the next floor. You do not have a
