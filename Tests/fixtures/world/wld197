{GREEN}{BOLD}The Path to Garkin's Hut{green}~


  As you step off the familiar road you find yourself
  on a forest path. You feel the pebbles and sand
  under your feet and the heavy smell of pine trees in
  the air. Then you realize how dark the forest is
  around you and you feel a chill. The adventurer in
  you is stronger than the fear. There is nothing to
  do but continue.  Besides you'd miss all the fun if
  you didn't.

{GREEN}{BOLD}The Path to Garkin's Hut{green}{bold}~


  As you walk slowly down the forest path, you feel
  danger in the air. The woods close in around you
  and you suddenly realize how quiet it is. The
  animals of the forest aren't making a sound, as if
  they know something you don't. WAIT!! Was that
  something moving in the underbrush? No, that's
  just your imagination, or was it?

{GREEN}{BOLD}The Path to Garkin's Hut{green}{bold}~


  You've picked up your pace along the path and the
  silence of the forest is starting to get to you.
  You've also begun to ask yourself "Just who the hell
  is Garkin?" One of your buddies informs you that
  Garkin is a local, but very powerful magician, who
  some consider to be a warlock. WAIT!! Did you hear
  that? No, that's just your imagination again...
  ...Maybe.

{GREEN}{BOLD}The Path to Garkin's Hut{green}{bold}~


  In the distance you can see the faint outline of
  Garkin's hut. You hear the fast murmur of voices
  coming from within.  It sounds as if someone is
  chanting. As you start to wish you had used the
  bathroom before you left, you see something which
  is low to the ground rushing at you from the edge
  of the forest.

  Wow! That was close, but you made it out alive.
  You don't think that the people in the hut heard
  you however the chanting seems to have grown louder.
  You can hear the harsh voice of an old man.  This 
  must be the {MAGENTA}{BOLD}Garkin{magenta}{bold} you've heard so much about.

  The trees form a wide tunnel right up to the door of
  Garkin's hut. The stories you've heard about this 
  so-called warlock makes you hesitate to enter. Still 
  the overwhelming desire to stop this annoying chanting, 
  that is ringing in your ears, is all that you can

  You find yourself in a small cluttered hut. There
  are vials and jars everywhere. In the center of the
  room a {RED}{BOLD}pentagram{red}{bold} is drawn on the floor with a golden
  brazier tipped over in the center of it. Between you
  and the {RED}{BOLD}pentagram{red}{bold} stands a tall, bearded man.
  Finally, you meet Garkin.

  As you walk into this tent you see that it is full of
  books.  The walls are lined with all kinds of colors 
  and they are piled high on the floor.  You can't read
  most of the book titles because they are printed in a
  language you don't even recognize.  As you look around 
  you notice that there are some with recognizable titles.
  When you look closer you see the only books in your 
  language are PULP FICTION and THE HITCH HIKER'S GUIDE
  TO THE GALAXY.  The odd thing is, they're filed under 
  non-fiction.

  Condoms, now this is something you know about.  It would
  probably be best if you pick up a few now, just in case. 
  When you look around the room you see that they have condoms
  in every color and in a few shapes that make you kind of 
  nervous.  The condoms are divided on three different 
  walls by size.  The wall to the right of you has a large
  sign that says {RED}{BOLD}SMALL.{red}{bold}  The wall to thel left of you has a
  sign that says {YELLOW}{BOLD}MEDIUM{yellow}{bold} and the wall directly in front of you

  25 credits.'  You think to yourself at least this one

{RED}Toy Store{red}~


  As you step into this tent you hear a familiar tune.
  You've heard this tune before, but this time it is 
  being sung in pervish.  You look around and see toys
  all over the tent.  You see dolls and trucks from every 
  dimension.  There are bright cheerful objects that lighten 
  your soul and make you start to hum along to the 
  tune being sung in pervish.  What is that song?
  Then high on a shelf behind the counter you see where 
  the music is coming from and immediately stop humming. 
  The whole shelf is lined with {MAGENTA}Barney{magenta}.  You are surrounded
  by {MAGENTA}Barney{magenta} from every dimension.  Deveel {MAGENTA}Barney{magenta}, Cloddish 
  {MAGENTA}Barney{magenta}, Possittum {MAGENTA}Barney{magenta} and Pervish {MAGENTA}Barney{magenta}.  There are too
  many to count.  You come to the conclusion that {MAGENTA}Barney{magenta} 
  exists in all dimensions.

{RED}Carpet Tent{red}~


  This tent is filled with carpets of every size and
  color.  The colors are amazingly beautiful.  You
  figure this is the calmest place you've been 
  since you got here, so why not take a look-see.  
  You notice a beautiful red and gold weave carpet
  stretched out across one corner of the large tent.
  It looks so soft.  Just as you reach out to touch it
  you notice that it is chained to the floor.  Glancing 
  around, you notice that all of the carpets are tethered
  to iron rings.  You feel something touch you and find 
  the beautiful red and gold weave carpet is sniffing your 
  hand.

{RED}Communications Tent{red}~


  This tent is filled with every form of communication
  from wire telegrams to telepathic headbands.  It 
  seems that the Deveels have been taking advanced 
  communication devices into different dimensions and 
  selling them as a new invention.  Do you think 
  while you are here you should call your mother and 
  tell her you'll be late for dinner?

  Row after row of picnic tables fill this large tent.
  Beings from every dimension are laughing and drinking 
  from large glass mugs.  There is a polka band in the 
  corner of the tent and beautiful girls hurry to and 
  fro carrying mugs full of beer to the tables.  So!
  This is where the Germans got this idea.

{RED}Art Tent{red}~


  The first thing you see when you enter this tent is a
  life size statue that resembles 'THE KISS' by Rodin.
  Only this one is slightly different because it has two
  deveels kissing.  You shudder and continue to look 
  around the room.  There are many interesting works of art
  here.  It seems the Deveels like sculptures and the 
  Clods like crayons.  The deveel working here shoves 
  a cheap copy of the Mona Lisa in your face telling you
  he can make you a good deal.

{RED}Dragon Pen{red}~


  You smell sulfur when you step inside and wonder what
  is for sale here.  As your eyes adjust to the gloom
  you see baby dragons sleeping on the swept dirt 
  floor.  You had always thought dragons were creatures 
  of myth, but here they are.  Your movements awake a 
  small purple dragon.  He is so cute you just have to 
  pet him.  Just as you are leaving, the dragon starts to
  follow you.  'You Fool,' bellows a deveel as he steps 
  out from the shadows.  'You've let him bond to you, he's 
  useless to me now, you'll have to pay me for him.'

{RED}Recliner Tent{red}~


  Well, it seems that the Lazy Boy Recliner is 
  something that all dimensions appreciate.  This
  tent is full of recliners of every color and size.
  Everyone here seems relaxed and happy.  The deveel
  who owns this tent has hired help from every 
  dimension to model their recliners for you.  As
  you stroll by each exhibit, you start to realize that
  recliners are used for much more than putting your 
  feet up at the end of the day.

  to go fishing.  The walls of the tent are lined
  with dimensional portals.  Above the portals are

  cream near the counter.  People from all dimensions
  wonder through the store looking for their favorite 
  snacks and drinks to take on their journey.  In the 
  corner gathered around a small table is a group of 
  Deveels talking while they take a lunch break from 
  their own tents.

  Tequila exists in every dimension.  This has to be

  special on nuclear warheads in aisle 12.  On aisle 2 
  there is special on sawed-off shotguns.  There is a 
  deveel standing here trying to talk a Claudish man into 
  trading a pointed stick in for a slingshot.

  This tent resembles a dungeon.  It is completely
  equipped with chains, whips, shackles and many other 
  things you have never seen yet you know are painful.  
  There are people everywhere in this tent, some crying,
  some laughing but all seem to be wearing the same look
  of intensity.  As you decide to slip out without being
  noticed a Deveel dressed in a black leather suit asks, 
  ''How may I serve you today, master?''

  They have everything else here?  Why not a clock 
  merchant?  The ticking in this tent is driving 
  you insane.  The only sense of quiet in the whole 
  tent is the section of digital clocks near the door.
  The most amazing thing here is all the clocks are 
  ticking then tocking at exactly the same time.

  and in the background you hear anguished screams.
  There is a sign on the back wall that says, ''This week's
  special, Appendectomy for only 210 credits.  Currency
  from all dimensions welcome.''  Looking around the room
  you realize these people don't look like they are 
  doing so well.  Then you hear the Deveel working here
  explaining to a patient how a medical degree on Deva 
  only takes 10 weeks.

  You have to admit it, you have absolutely no idea
  what is in this tent.  You can't even begin to 
  describe what items are for sale here.  Every 
  dimension has a differnt use for these items.  
  What people from the sluggish dimension are eating
  the Pervs are rubbing on their scales.  In the 
  back corner of the tent, there is a group of 
  Deveels smoking the same stuff.  Maybe this isn't
  the best tent for an Earther to be.

  saying what a fantastic food seasoning dark leather

  At the rear of the tent a Deveel wearing white dread

  that with this many Deveel merchants in such close 
  proximity, it would save time to have a remote court
  room open 24 hours a day.  An Earther whispers to you
  nervously,  ''Believe it or not, the only Deveels 
  that are not merchants are lawyers.'' Somehow you 
  find that easy to believe.

  there are some dimensions where the people have REALLY

  laughing because, to you, nothing looks sillier than a 
  Pervert in a cowboy hat.

  a nasty mood.  After your vision clears you decide
  it would be best if you move on, however, this deveel 
  will not let you leave.  You owe him money for the 
  picture!  The Deveel points to a sign that reads:

                  YOUR OWN EXPENSE.

  creatures laughing and eating.  Their food is the most
  disgusting thing you have ever smelled in your life -
  and it's moving!  When the perverts aren't eating  
  or stuffing their faces they're shoving the food back on 
  their plates.  Suddenly you hear someone yelling, ''Hey,
  what are you doing in here.''  Now you feel afraid 
  because it seems they think you're part of the menu.

  comparison to the stentch of the pervish food 
  tent, this smells almost unreal.  All around the tent
  there are baskets, pots and vases filled with flowers of 
  every size shape and color.  You think how nice it 
  would be to smell one of these beautiful roses.  In 
  front of you, a short sluggish lady tries to smell 
  one and you see it bite off the tip of her nose.

  against your forearm.  You feel a soft breath of air
  on  your neck and turn around, a 6 foot tall pervert 
  female is smiling at you with her fangs showing.  
  She is wearing pink silk lingerie that shows her 
  green scaled cleavage.  You keep telling yourself, 
  ''breath, breath'' and she asks, ''would you like 
  to try this one we have it in your size''.

  Well, you've come to the right place my friend.
  At Warriors For Hire, you can rent as many warriors
  as you need, all magically disguised to fit into
  your dimension.  How do you think the Romam Empire

  a picture of Isk taking his latest batch of steamy hot 
  cinnamon buns from the oven.  Suddenly your mouth begins 
  to water.  How long has it been since you ate last ? 
  Unexpectedly the Deveel who is operating the establishment
  is in your face informing you that you may not stand and 
  sniff all day - you should buy something or leave.

  This has to be the  most interesting brothel you've

  up the room. The heavy beat of rythmic music already
  has your head spinning and you haven't even seen what's
  on the menu.  Then a cute red-headed Earther with long
  legs and stiletto heels saunters up to you and wiggles
  her finger for you to follow her behind a curtain.  
  Painted on the curtain in bright red lettering reads:

          mating is done at your own risk. This

  Finally you've found some food.  At least it smells
  like food.  Maybe you better wait and make sure it's
  not moving first.  Lined around inside of the tent 
  are tables filled with food from every dimension.  
  It seems the only dimension not represented here is 
  Perv. Pervish food smells so bad that it is not 
  allowed to be sold here.  A Deveel smiles at you 
  saying, ''try my Gyro it's the best on Deveel''. Wow,
  your favorite.  You would think that you had died 
  and gone to heaven if it weren't being sold to you by
  a Deveel.

  earthling and you come to understand that in some dimensions
  men are collected by women as a hobby.  The deveel working

  himself in every dimension and opened his chain 
  of stores.  Here at the Bazaar on Deva you find 
  the original Walmart.  Along the walls of the tent
  you see Sam Walton's portrait as he appears in

  merchandise of course there is a big {YELLOW}SMILEY{yellow} face.

{RED}A Hidden Tent{red}~


  As you step inside this dimly lit tent, you smell
  the smoke of a cheep cigar.  Slowly and purposefully
  a stocky Deveel wearing a red suit stands up from 
  behind a large desk covered with money.  It seems 
  you've stumbled upon the leader of the ring of 
  thugs who work the bazaar here at Deva.

{RED}Behind the tents at Deva{red}~


  Your eyes sting from the smoke and you hear screams
  of the thugs in this section of the alley.  In the
  middle of the chaos there is a baby dragon with 
  smoke curling from his nostrils.  Flames at the 
  panicked thugs around him.  The only time a young
  dragon reacts like this is when someone has threatened
  his master.

  This corner of the alley seems harmless enough and
  you seem to have found the master that the baby dragon
  was protecting.   He's a young man with curly blond
  hair who seems to be concentrating behind fluttering 
  eyelids.  As you come closer you feel the energy 
  building inside of him, quietly he begins floating 
  above the ground.

{RED}Behind the tents at Deva{red}~


  You have come to the end of a long row of tents.  The
  backs of shops close in on you to the right and left.
  In scattered clumps along the walls there are groups 
  of scuzzy looking people whispering to each other with
  their backs half turned to you.  Maybe this isn't the 
  best place for you to be.  Just then one of them catches
  your eye and gives you a smile that chills you to the
  bone.

{MAGENTA}Gna's Room{magenta}~


  Your senses come alive, clearer than you have ever
  known was possible.  Every nerve tingles with acute 
  awareness.  The vitality of the earth, the splendor 
  of the sky;  you see it all as plainly as you see
  your own hands.  Your nostrils fill with the mingled
  scents of wild grasses and salty sea.  A gentle 
  breeze flows across your face like a lovers touch.
  The wind, the birds, insects, even your own heartbeat 
  combines to serenade your ears in perfect harmony.
  You do not need to worry about protecting yourself, 
  there will be no danger here.
