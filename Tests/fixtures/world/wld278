{C}A {BLU}Blue {C}Room in the Cube{c}~
{BLU}
   This room glows a dim bluish color. The light is just enough to see
by and gives the room an eerie feeling. The room is a 10 foot cube and
has 2 foot wide doors in the center of the doors, ceiling and floor. It 
looks as though there are some kind of mechanisms in the walls but they
appear to be inactive right now. This room must be safe to stay in for
the moment. Judging from the screams that you hear in the distance, you
think it wise not to count on the safety of this room. The doors all look
to have some kind of numbers on them. Could they mean something...

trapped inside. All of the doors in the room have numbers on them.

{C}A {BLU}Blue {C}Room in the Cube{c}~
{BLU}
   This room glows a dim bluish color. The light is just enough to see
by and gives the room an eerie feeling. The room is a 10 foot cube and
has 2 foot wide doors in the center of the doors, ceiling and floor. It 
looks as though there are some kind of mechanisms in the walls but they
appear to be inactive right now. This room must be safe to stay in for
the moment. Judging from the screams that you hear in the distance, you
think it wise not to count on the safety of this room. The doors all look
to have some kind of numbers on them. Could they mean something...

have continued to survive in this death machine due to your cunning. A 
situation that this thing you are in seems to be trying hard to remedy. 
You just hope that you can figure out the clues that the creators of 
this monstrosity have given you. All the doors in the room have numbers

{BLU}
   This room glows a dim bluish color. The light is just enough to see
by and gives the room an eerie feeling. The room is a 10 foot cube and
has 2 foot wide doors in the center of the doors, ceiling and floor. It 
looks as though there are some kind of mechanisms in the walls but they
appear to be inactive right now. This room must be safe to stay in for
the moment. Judging from the screams that you hear in the distance, you
think it wise not to count on the safety of this room. The doors all look
to have some kind of numbers on them. Could they mean something...

You get a sense of peace and serenity in here. It appears that not all
the rooms are meant to destroy. You feel comfortable enough that you can
regroup your thoughts and rest comfortably. Maybe you can try and prepare
yourself for what you know will be more difficult times in other rooms.
All the doors in this room have numbers on them. You are sure that it

{W}
   You enter the room and wait for something to happen. After a few 
moments of waiting it seems safe to relax. Just as you sit down you 
start to realize that it is getting quite warm in here. The walls are 
starting to give off a great deal of heat and it keeps getting hotter.
Before the heat becomes unbearable you race to open the door to the east.
The door pulls open and you frantically rush through it before the heat
threatens to overwhelm you.

   When you enter the room small jets of liquid pop out of the walls. A 
split second later they start to shoot out a clear liquid. You barely
have time to react as you hear the liquid hiss as it hits the opposite
walls. You leap for the closest door and frantically twist the latch. You
rip open the door and leap through just as a small jet sprays the floor 
where you just were.

at another safe room, you hear muted screams off in the distance. It is a
not so gentle reminder that this thing was created for one and only one
purpose: to destroy those individuals unlucky enough to find themselves
trapped inside. All of the doors in the room have numbers on them.
Perhaps that means something...

{B}A {W}White {B}Room in the Cube{b}~
{W}
   This room glows a bright white color. The room is a 10 foot cube and
has 2 foot wide doors in the center of the doors, ceiling and floor. It 
is warm and inviting in here. Just as you begin to feel a sense of relief
at another safe room, you hear muted screams off in the distance. It is a
not so gentle reminder that this thing was created for one and only one
purpose: to destroy those individuals unlucky enough to find themselves
trapped inside. All of the doors in the room have numbers on them.
Perhaps that means something...

Before the heat becomes unbearable you race to open the door in the

{B}A {W}White {B}Room in the Cube{b}~
{W}
   You enter the room and wait for something to happen. After a few 
moments of waiting it seems safe to relax. Just as you sit down you 
start to realize that it is getting quite warm in here. The walls are 
starting to give off a great deal of heat and it keeps getting hotter.
Before the heat becomes unbearable you race to open the door in the
floor. The door pulls open and you frantically rush through it before 
the heat threatens to overwhelm you.

{W}A {Y}Yellow {W}Room in the Cube{w}~
{Y}
   This room glows a soothing yellow color. The room is a 10 foot cube 
and has 2 foot wide doors in the center of the doors, ceiling and floor. 
You get a sense of peace and serenity in here. It appears that not all
the rooms are meant to destroy. You feel comfortable enough that you can
regroup your thoughts and rest comfortably. Maybe you can try and prepare
yourself for what you know will be more difficult times in other rooms.
All the doors in this room have numbers on them. You are sure that it 
must mean something...

{B}A {W}White {B}Room in the Cube{b}~
{W}
   You hear a click sound coming from behind you. Just as you begin to 
wonder what it was that it might be, you see in front of you the wall 
of a cage. It looks as though it is made of razor wire. Looking at it 
you see that there is blood dripping from it. Just then the pain hits 
you and you realize as your body parts start to separate that it has 
                      already gone through you!!

{BLU}
   You step into the room and you realize how dry it is in here. Before 
you can think of why it might be that way, you hear a click and see a 
small pole begin to extend from the far wall. You hear a tick sound as a
pilot light ignites. A split second later, a huge flame begins to pour 
out of the pole right at you! Searing pain washes through you as your
body burns. Your only thought is to make the pain stop. Make it stop!!

   As you slowly step into the room you, a light reflects off something.
You realize that the entire room has razor sharp wires along the edges. 
Horror fills your thoughts as you see that the wires are being twisted 
into a cone shape from the top of the room. The wires twist through the 
core of your body slicing you apart!

   You enter the room and wait for something to happen, but it doesn't.
You manage to focus your eyes for a moment and realize that there is a 
glowing door at the end of the room. After what you have seen in this
cube you are understandably nervous, but your curiosity is getting the 
better of you. Could this be it? Is this really the end of this hell 
on earth? For the sake of your sanity, you hope that it is...
