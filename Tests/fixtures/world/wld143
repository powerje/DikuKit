A study~
This is a small room off of the bedroom to the south. On the wall you notice
a large painting of a mage destroying an entire army of some kind with
just one fireball. Whoever this man is, you think he must be a powerful
mage. Just then, you feel a slight wind, and a man that was not there
before is now standing in front of you.

using the dead for their own personal gains. That would explain the
corpses. Seems like you've arrived at the bad time, as the necromancer
is here, along with an army of his undead minions, whom he gestures to 
attack.
You do have enough time though, to notice a chamber off to the west.

A small connecting tunnel~
This is a small chamber leading off to another chamber to the south. You
notice that it appears that not many have come this way. The stalagmites
and stalactites add an sense of antiquity. You wonder how long 
this chamber has been here. You shake your head, wondering how you ended
up thinking about that.

This tunnel is a continuation of the chamber you just came from. More
stalactites and stalagmites adorn this chamber. You think you can see a
fire or some sort of light up ahead. Seems like that's a reasonable 
place to head. The darkness of these tunnels just seems to suffocate
your measly light source.

You find yourself standing in a fair sized chamber. Various magical
devices are the only decoration of this room, aside from a small bed
on one side of the chamber. You also notice various magical tomes
on a shelf. You reach out to take one but instantly withdraw your hand.
Seems like the owner of these books has placed wards on them to prevent
nosy explorers like you from taking them. On a desk, you notice an
interesting looking paper. Maybe there's something there to be read.

paper~
It appears to be a paper on planar travel:
At long last! I have discovered the secret of entering the planes of
existance. It has taken many years, in fact centuries, to finally
succeed where others have failed. I have created a staff that can open
a gateway to any plane. Of particular interest to me is the Astral Plane.
This is what I have been working on forever, now at last, success!

because the walls are too smooth for that, too perfect to be made, you

tunnel was made by human hands.

chamber by which you entered this tunnel is still plainly visible far to
the east, but it doesn't feel that way. You look to the west, and the
light is still visible. You continue on, hoping that you'll eventually
reach the end of this tunnel.

Well, at least you've found out why it's been getting warmer the further
you came west. Before you is a swirling mass of flames that radiate immense
heat. You're awestuck by the sight. You've never seen anything quite like
it. You then wonder why it is you haven't been burnt to a crisp, but instead
of worrying about that, you get the strongest feeling to continue. Here you
are, a mere explorer, on the verge of seeing things you never new existed.
That's when you notice you can't enter the gateway, because it's locked.

Relieved to have exited the plane of fire, you find yourself standing
at the edge of the darkness that you saw at the enterance. This is the
point in the universe where all the planes of existance meet and merge.
You can't tell just by looking where one ends and the next begins.
This is chaos itself defined. However, way below you you notice a 
darkness more oppressive than anything you've ever enocountered before.
Legend has it, that this darkness is the beginning of the Abyss,
whereby one can enter the Astral Plane.

This is a room that is in poor condition, on the verge of collapse, but yet
something keeps it together. Displayed in locked cabinents are various
daggers, throwing darts, darts used in blow guns, short swords, all very
lethal looking. It also contains vials of various liquids, and from the
colors, you can only assume they're poisons of some sort. You feel a slight
chill as you realize you've stumbled into what could only be the home base
of an assassin, one hired to shorten the lives of certain individuals from
time to time. You turn to leave, only to see a shadowy figure dressed in
black and face concealed approaching you with dagger drawn. You know you
can't flee, but your fears are put to rest as the figure sheathes its
dagger and pulls back its hood, revealing a drow, who motions for you to
sit and be her guest for a while. You hesitate, then realize you would have
been dead already if she meant to kill you.
