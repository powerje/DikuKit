{BOLD,CYAN}On The {BLUE}Swift {CYAN}Flowing {BLUE}River~

{CY,BO}     As the river exits the town of Midgaard it picks up speed and wisks
  you along high banks flanked by the trees of Haon-Dor.  As the town
  fades in the east, you approach a gloomy forest to the west.{cy,bo}

{GR,BO}The {BLU}River{GR}bank{gr}~

{CY,BO}    The river is deep, and runs swiftly in an east-west direction.  To the
  north the river eddies and enters a backwash where a small bank extends
  down from a dark, thick stand of trees.  It doesn't look particulary
  inviting however.{cy,bo}

{CY,BO}The T{BLU}w{CY}i{BLU}s{CY}t{BLU}y{CY} Part{cy,bo}~
{BOLD,CYAN}The river twists and turns and nearly tosses you out of your boat. The water is freezing and it's almost impossible to tell what is underneath you. But you get a feeling that there is something under there and it's not here to make friends with you. You have 2 choices, continue with your trek or head back east.

{BOLD,CYAN}The water seems to calm down, and the Haon-Dor forest to the north is fading from you view. The river continues to the west towards a delta, and you can spot in the distance some large island. Might as well keep going.

{CY,BO}    You are at the edge of the river delta, where the river empties

{CY,BO}    You are making your way along a channel in the river delta between
  the island to the west and the shore to the south and east.  To the
  south an aging broken down looking pier juts out from land and toward
  the west the channel works it way close to the island as it moves around
  its southern tip.{cy,bo}

  of the river and here near the edge of the sea there is a large

{CY,BO}    The delta meets the sea here.  To the west you see nothing but
  ocean on the horizon.  Sea birds squawk noisily at your approach
  and take flight from a nearby beach head on the island.  It looks
  as though this could be the last stop for those heading out to sea.{cy,bo}
