{Y,BO}Level 2 Guard Booth{bo}~

This is a very small room with a door to the North as the only
apparent exit.  There are a desk and a chair.  On the desk you
recognize what must have been the automatic door control panel 
for this level, but it is evident that it is broken. Some dra-
werless file cabinets are piled on  the  corner and  what  was 
their contents lie in a disorganized heap on the floor.

{Y,BO}The Entrance{bo}~

You are at the entrance of a plain wide, low, concrete building.
You are welcomed by a guard who looks very  agitated.   He says:
Sir, I'm glad you came. The inmates have taken control of seve-
ral of the levels, and some of the ward-guards have  lost  their
grasp of reality  too.  I hope you'll  fix it, sir.  But I would
rather we wait for the National Guard Emergency Squad."  Then he
says "anyways" and opens the door for you.

{bo,C}The Parking Lot{bo}~

You are walking along a not so big parking lot, just past the 
entrance checking point.  The lot is surrounded by a  terrain 
covered by bright green  grass  and some short, newly planted 
trees. A plain low building lies to the north. You think you 
heard a muffled cry, a human cry, but you are not sure.  May-
be it was not such a good idea to visit the  Pescadero Mental 
Institution after all.

{BO,Y}The Screening Booth{bo}~

Here ends the wide avenue.  In front of you, separated by
what appears to be a high electrified fence, lies a large 
clean and nice looking terrain,  with nice groomed grass, 
and a plain looking building in the centre.  The only way 
in is covered by the check-up officer in his booth.  
-
He says: "May I see your badge, please, sirrrr?"

{bo,C}The Wide Paved Road{bo}~

Same nice wide road, sidewalks and trees.  All is extremely 
clean. Beyond the trees you see a carefully groomed grass.  
You think  that  you  could come and picnic there sometime.  
There is something on the sidewalk shining in the noon sun.

smells of  flowers and the nice hot dry sun warms your skin.
You see a sign by the side of the road.

La Cueva del Zorro~

This is the famous cave of El Zorro, his hideaway.  Hanging
from the ceiling you see some Serrano-ham-legs,  along with
garlic strings, and some hot pimentos.  Stacked by the wall 
there are some red-wine (tintorro) barrels.  From the  back 
of the cave some music can be heard,  you  distinguish  the 
sound of guitars, and some voices singing gaily in Spanish.

You see a wide door.  It is very sturdy.  Probably made with
several wood and steel layers.  It is badly scratched and 
smeared with what looks like a message.  Part of it is
barely readable, it's written in ...human excrement...ack.
It reads: "...valuable......false wall..."  Very intriguing!

The hospital-like hallway turns to the north.  To the   west you
see the way you came.  To the south there is a  sturdy  reinfor-
ced door.   Cries and curses can be heard coming from the  other
side of the door.  Maybe it's not a good idea to open that door.

{bo,G}Ward {BO}S3{bo,G} ({Y}medium security area{bo,G}){bo}~

You are  standing at the entrance of the South ward in this level.
A pile of  smashed furniture lies scattered  on the floor.  To the
North a  sturdy looking door separates  you  from the corridor. To
the South  some  heavy  breathing  comes  from the dark.  A strong
odor permeates the air here, and it is not very pleasant, now that
you think about it.

{bo,W}the Level 5 Hallway{bo}~

The hospital-like hallway continues to the West and to the South.
To the  East  you see a reinforced door with big scratches on it
and what  looks  like ... BLOOD!  Grunts, cries and curses sound
behind the door.

{BO,BLA}The Hole{bo}~

Used for a long time to put "pacify" violent immates, "the hole"
still reeks  of decaded organic matter.  Some bones testify the
fate of those  poor  souls  dropped here.  Some bricks shine wi
th a magic light, as if they could be somehow activated by some
magic word, you think and think, and in your mind a story takes
shape, it's a story of revenge, a French story, of someone in a
cell just like this one.  You cannot remember the name  of  the
author of that story.

{bo,W}the End of the Hallway{bo}~
The hallways  comes to an end here.  It continues to the east.
To the  north a bullet-proof glass  door blocks your way.  It
does not seem wise to go there alone, maybe you could convince
a guard to accompany you.  Now you see a small sign.

ATTENTION: This dangerous wing has been  condemned.
Rumor has it that there is still, in some underground
and undiscovered room a way to get there.  Not the
sane thing to do, however, you are here!

{bo,C}a Dark and Hot Stinking Tunnel{bo}~

Strange!!! This part of the Pescadero building looks rather
like an old construction site tunnel.  But even stranger...
it's covered on all sides with posters of old movies by
Jack Nicholson.  There is no way to get back, but there
is a faint light to the east, and some chanting coming
from that direction.

Through a dense curtain of smoke you see the silohuette...yes,
it's him, or rather what the lobotomists left of him, it is
Jack Nicholson and some of his fans.  Careful: They are nuts!

{BO,Y}Level 3 Guard Booth{bo}~

This is a very small room with a door to the North as the only
apparent exit.  There are a desk and a chair.  On the desk you
recognize what must have been the automatic door control panel
for this level, but it is evident that it is broken. Some dra-
werless file cabinets are piled on  the  corner and  what  was
their contents lie in a disorganized heap on the floor.
