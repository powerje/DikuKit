{WH,BO}  Oh God no! {BLA,BO}This can't be happening! {R,BO}You can't escape it..

{Y,BO}                SCHOOL! ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRGH!{b}

{G}  And here you thought mudding was a good escape from school?
{G}  Ha! Anyways, here you are, backpack in hand, walking towards
{G}  your early morning classes. Beautiful trees and singing
{G}  birds create an inspiring scenery along the way. Wandering
{G}  along the path, you become nostalgic for your warm, cozy

{Y}  and boring grey tone. While the walls still fashion that
{Y}  hue, the floor has collected numerous prizes falling out of
{Y}  backpacks. There's some {R}pens{Y} over there, a {BLA,BO}calculator{b}{Y} near
{Y}  your foot, and even the {WH,BO}shredded shards of glass{b}{Y} from one
{Y}  unlucky nerd's {WH,BO}glasses{b}{Y}. Loud shouts and yelps are coming

{R}Library - Checkout Desk{b}~

{Y}  This is the entrance to the nerd's library. Apparently, even
{Y}  on Saturday night, the line for check out goes all the way
{Y}  to the doors! Two library attendants are working feverishly
{Y}  to ensure the students' contentment, scanning and offering
{Y}  out books with a passion. Most of the students wander around
{Y}  with {C,BO}scientific journals {b}{Y}and {G,BO}National Geographics{b}{Y}.{b}

{G}  Your stomach violently churns upon noticing the puke-green
{G}  floor clashing with the forest-green wall covering.
{G}  Eastward, perhaps you can escape this awful display with
{G}  rows and rows of seemingly endless books.{b}

{BLA,BO}Professors' Offices{b}~

{R}  To the north and south, offices contain the brains and raw
{R}  power behind this building's influence. A stench of
{R}  un-showered, au-naturelle overtakes your lungs. Hand prints
{R}  and streaks of {R,BO}blood{b}{R} mar the dirty walls, and the {R,BO}pool of
{R,BO}  gore{b}{R} must have been left behind from some sacrificial
{R}  animal. This school has gone from intelligent and
{R}  sophisticated to creepy and weird.{b}

{R}Prof's Office - Room 501{b}~

{BLA,BO}  You see a small, 8-by-8 room with nothing but books
{BLA,BO}  regarding calculus, linear algebra, and database theory. The
{BLA,BO}  textbooks are piled against walls, as the bookshelves have
{BLA,BO}  previously been filled. A desk is placed up against a large,
{BLA,BO}  grungy window, and after clearing the dust, you see someone
{BLA,BO}  hard at work. {R,BO}His eyes glow with a burning red heat.{b}

{BLA,BO}Prof's Office - Room 502{b}~

{BLA,BO}  You stand in the center of a barren 8-by-8 room. Unlike room
{BLA,BO}  501, there truly isn't much to behold. In fact, the remains
{BLA,BO}  of this room include but one lonely desk off in the corner.
{BLA,BO}  Your nose adjusts to the stench, the floor having been
{BLA,BO}  occupied by empty bottles of Molson Canadian and Coors
{BLA,BO}  Light. A student sulks in the corner, a soft and gentle
{BLA,BO}  moan of agony pouring from their dehydrated lips.

{Y}  No books, no desks... What is this? Judging from the large
{Y}  plethora of whips, leathers, and sharp metallic objects, the
{Y}  best guess is to assume this is the sex-ed laboratory. Who
{Y}  knew that professors could get so kinky? You, an upstanding
{Y}  citizen, are fully prepared to leave this scarring memory
{Y}  behind, but the cracking of a whip behind your head would
{Y}  suggest whoever is here with you has another agenda. Did you
{Y}  bring your whistle?{b}

{Y,BO}  some evil, diabolical reason for this room's availability.

{C}  many are wired together. Numbers and functions are being
{C}  calculated simultaneously at an astronomical rate. One of
{C}  the screens has a cross-section of Midgaard upon it! A faint

{C}  just a quick glance, it comes from no ordinary nerd.{b}

{WH,BO}Turbolift{b}~

{WH,BO}  A turbolift? In a school? Where does it lead? Why is it
{WH,BO}  here? So many questions and so little answers. While taking
{WH,BO}  a moment to observe, you notice that a bright silver
{WH,BO}  adamantium lines the walls of the lift, floor, and ceiling.
{WH,BO}  Only one door remains due to the cracks against the wall. A
