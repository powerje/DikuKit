Red Ridge Mountains~
 
 This is a peak at the southernmost tip of the Red Ridge 
 Mountains. You find that a group of Orges uses this area as
 one of their most favorite stomping grounds. The scattered
 bones of humans and orcs don't make you feel welcome.

Temple of the Damned~
 
 The moans of the damned echo all around you as you enter 
 the Temple of the Damned. The priests of the temple stop in
 there tracks, turn, and face you. You can see an Orc that
 radiates a powerful black aura.

Elwynn Forest~
 
 This is truly one of the most beautiful places in all the 
 lands of Azeroth. The ancient trees tower over your head 
 and seem to radiate an aura of wisdom and safety. You feel 
 at peace with nature except for this feeling that someone
 is watching you. All you hear, however, is hear the wind.
