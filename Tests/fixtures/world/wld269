Quinn's Ship of Paradise~
   As you gaze out onto the sparkling white beaches of the coast,
you can't help but feel a euphoric sense of peace seetle over your
warm, sun-dappled body.  You are truly at rest here.
The shamrock symbol of the flag flutters slightly in the gentle 
blowing breeze.
A small Seagull allights on you shoulder. 
In his beak, he carries four golden shamrocks, surely a good omen.
Welcome to Quinn's ship of Irish paradise.

A Dark and Gloomy Path~

  This grim looking path seems to lead towards the 
  sound of laughter.  A dense fog seems to have 
  coagulated around you as soon as you entered the 
  path, but it could all be part of the Gummi's 
  deceptions...

The reception room~

  Staring around you, you can't help but notice the 
  beauty of the King's palace.  Gold seems to gleam 
  from every nook and cranny.  A beautiful crystal 
  chandelier glimmers gently above your head.  This 
  king is LOADED!!

Before you stands a small wooden door.  It appears to go into a closet of
some sort.  It's bulging in the middle and apperently is holding back
quite a heavy load.  Might not want to open that...

  Looking over to the east you see why.  Trolls are 
  chained and shackled in any way possible.  This must 
  be where igthorn breaks his troops in.

  Garbage is laying everywhere.  Food is rotting away... 
  either forgotten or waiting to be cooked.  Grease and 
  slime coat everything and the room is full of rodents.  
  Not exactly a five-star kitchen.

  bone.  Better  to be  careful of where you're walking 
  however... these steps have seen alot of misuse and 
  don't look stable.

   You stand in a small clearing in the middle of a large
   pine forest.  The sounds of birds chirping gently begins
   to lull you into a sense of tranquility.  The smell
   of fresh pine mingles with the scent of flowers and
   warm spring air to create a scent that simply
   can not be replicated.  A small stream babbles quietly
   to your left only adding to the peacefulness here.
   Perhaps now you understand why Neysa hides here.
