RESERVED FOr Lorna's room.~
From the window of this quaint, well decorated balcony area
is one of the more spectacular views in the world.  Nearby is the
Blue and White spire that is the (<B>) Dance Palace, friendly
dragons float about the heavens, and off in the distance, beyond
the labyrinth's and pathways of Northern Crossroads is the city
of Midgaard.
Long Blue and Silver drapes frame this scene, and mirror tiles
on the ceiling reflect an image of the intricate marble floors.

This is a zone that provides both good experience and eq.  The pigs and
menehune give good cash (700k-1 mil) and you can also get menehune waters
which are triple heal.  For good eq there is the Ali'i Crown, Minor Collar
of Magic, and Collosal Spear of the Ancients.
From Mk[],s,3e,2s,2w,4s,e,n,2e,2n,3u,n,d,n.  From this point just go north
to kill pigs and menehune (and Mynah), but if you are going for eq then hunt
guard and this should take you to the guard for Ali' crown.  I suggest you
be at least level 40+ to fight him solo, and first spell him up. Open door
and go south.  Dispel, guinness, (and maybe blind) Ali'i chief and have a
ball. For minor collar ... from entrance go all n,w,all n,e,3n,2w,all n,w.
Spell up the guard if you are about lvl 40... and depending on your eq...
(con him to be sure).. open and go south. Spell up the Kahunas and have a
ball.  Soloing these mobs for players below 40+ is not advised.

To get collosal spear, from entrance, go 2n,4w,u,s,w,s,u,w,n,u,n,u,s,w,2u.
To the north is the hermit, it is a one person room, so send the toughest
person in, spell up hermit and kill (careful now, north of here is a DT!!).
Now go 2u. Here is the King and his guards.  Blind the guards and then
kill them one by one.  Now dispel, blind, and guinness the king and kill
him for the spear.  This part is for groups of atleast 3 mid level avatars. 
                                  Blade.

E
Olympus~
 
This area would be best suited for levels 20-30 to run.
From Mk[],6e,3n,2w,5n,3e,5s,3e,3u,n.
This gets you to the town of Olympus.   Available here for purchase
are nectar and ambrosia potions from the alchemist.  There are
several 'good' items including flaming gauntlets, glowing shield,
and blue robe.  The zone itself is pretty straight forward and does
not contain any DT's.  Things to be wary of include Ra, who casts
powerful spells, and the war hounds, which are very aggressive and
breath lightning (they carry a fair amount of cash).  Hounds are
worth approximately 5 mil exp but their breath can destroy eq.

dragonnia~
 
A group of midlevels can do this zone succesfully.  Rune is
required and mobs breath. CAUTION:: black dragon breaths acid.
from Mk[],s,3e,2s,5w,4n,e,n,4w,3d,e,4d,From this spot:
2w,2s 2 White Dragons(eye of the dragon)

lake powell~
 
This area i would suggest to avatars but high level thieves may be able
to get past the boaters if they backstab sucessfully.
These directions are to the the waterski, waterski gloves and the wetsuit.
Directions:from Mk[],9e,4n.  A few notes about monsters before I start:
Boaters assist each other, PERSONS are aggressive and will attack through
rune, sea horse, sea rats, sea dinosaurs assist each other in combat.  The
best way to fight is to blind all but one and attack the on who can see,
then kill of the rest one by one.  Kill boaters.  3n,2e,n,w,n,w open
hidden s, kill sea rats,s kill waterskiier 2n,2w,s open hidden w,kill
sea horses w kill waterskiier, 2e,n open hidden,n,kill sea dinosaurs,n
kill waterskiier.

   This zone is really suggested for avatars and maybe high dual class.
It has baggy pants, leprechaun shoes, chainsaw and bladded glove.
   From market square 8e 2u 2s e 3s e s e 3d 4w 2s 2d n 2e s.
This is the leprechaun...he has the leprechaun shoes and 10 mil coins.
3n and you must kill godzilla to get the tooth(key).  Godzilla breaths
fire so watch your equipment in inventory....put it into a container to
avoid being destroyed.  unlock/open door d.  4d 3s e takes you to the
elephant man who has the key to the boiler.  w s, this is leatherface
he has the chainsaw.  Spelling leatherface is optional but I suggest
disarming the chainsaw before getting to far into the fight.....
Now open the door to the south and go south.  This is freddy kreuger.
He has the bladed glove(haste).  Soloing Freddy seems to be almost
impossible, i would suggest a group as he hits extremely hard and
attacks 4 times.

   The normal mobs are suited for small groups of level 20-25 with
lots of potions.  The head mobs require groups of levels 40+ with
spells and potions.  The eq to be had are mainly +3 so it is a good
place to go to gather club eq.  
From Mk[],6e,5n,w.  Kill customers for XP, to get behind the counter,
work your way north and west.  The mobs behind the counter are tougher
and require some prudence.  To get to playland, find the head manager,
kill him and take his keys.  Toyland is mid south in the dining room.
Enter the toy and find your way to the top.  The brats along the way
carry 500K coin.  Grimace is here too and has a nice skin.  Kill the
kid at the top with the key.  Go back down and head towards the toilets.
Kill the birthday boy and take his toy.  North of him use the key to
gain access to the basement.  Down there you will find ronald with
his wig and the big boss with the cigar.  In one of the bathrooms there
is also the toilet paper collar. --> Shroud <--
~
E
tree~
  
From Mk[],all w (till you can not go west anymore). And you are in
the Tree. This is a good zone for levelling for lvls 10-20+.
For lvls 20+ you can kill panthers and golems. Levels 15 and below
can take on gorillas, rabid squirrels, orangutangs, and the other mobs
(except panthers and golems).  Low levels should stick to things like
tree snakes, termites, etc.  These are rough groupings and your eq or
hitpoints can affect the mobs you can fight.  So con the mobs and go
from there. In groups with a cleric and warrior have the cleric heal
and the warrior tank.. then you can take on any of the mobs.  There are
about 4 levels, and at the top is a shack with the head mob .. Treeson.
From Treeson is the treasure room which has no treasure, just a pile of
creatures for fight.  Beware of the rapid squirrels, they are aggresive
and will attack on sight.
So have fun.. and happy hunting.   ** Blade **

ec~
 
Welcome, this zone is only fer (<B>)ad mudders who wanna get kool xp and eq.

quest~

New rules do not allow us to post quest directions.  However, if
you ask some of the old club mortals, they may be able
to give you pretty good directions.

The purpose of the BC pill quest is to give you /100 strength.
I would recommend you be mid level dual class before attempting this.

   You haven't seen anything as tranquil as the setting that stretches out
before you. The wind blows gently through the palm leaves creating an almost
whisper like sound. The waves caress the white coral sands into small
delicate ripples beneath your feet. The sea stretches in all directions with
its warm blue waters.  You feel at home here and wish you never had to leave,
but the call of reality beckons you to return to you're life of adventure.
Nestled amongst the palms you see a Jade statue of the immortal figure Pog.

     You enter a psychaelically plasterd room of oblong shape and size.  In 
the background you hear the wild tune of Killjoy which makes you want to 
dance around wildly and shout at the top of your lungs.  You sense that the
room was designed for someone to really let it all out.  
Off to the far side you see the booger of a three year old wiped on the
carpet and a TV tubed tuned to the Pink Power Ranger Kimberly---WoW!!!

Byron's Love Poem : She Walks In Beauty~
                     SHE walks in beauty, like the night
                    Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
                 And all that's best of dark and bright
                    Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
                 Thus mellowed to that tender light
                    Which heaven to gaudy day denies.

                  One shade the more, one ray the less,
                    Had half impaired thy nameless grace,
                 Which waves in every raven tress,
                    Or softly lightens o'er her face;
                 Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
                     How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.

                 And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
                    So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
                 The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
                 But tell of days in goodness spent,
                  A mind at peace with all below,

Byron's Love Poem : So We'll Go No More A Roving~
                    So we'll go no more a-roving
                       So late into the night,
                   Though the heart be still as loving,
                     And the moon be still as bright.
                  For the sword outwears its sheath,
                     And the soul wears out the breast,
                  And the heart must pause to breath,
                     And love itself have rest.

                  Though the night was made for loving,
                     And the day returns too soon,
                  Yet we'll go no more a-roving
                     By the light of the moon.

   You stand upon a small and intimate frozen outdoor pond that over looks
the edge of the brisks woods.   You notice a few young boys roughhousing over
on the far side and a little girl trying to skate for her very first time with
her caring father guiding her nearby.  Though the air is cold here, you feel
a special warmth heating your heart inside as you know the love of your life
is holding your hands and skating nearby.

   You stand upon the white wooden boards of steps that creek gently and lead
up to the veranda of a cozy little cottage.  On the sides of each plank are
lovely lavendar orchids growing in pots that have been cared for carefully.
A warm and enlifting breeze sends toward you the nicely scented floral aroma
of the orchids and other flowers that grow on and around the porch.  You get
the romantic notion that this is somehow the happiest place on earth for
some loving couple.

   The information collected within the confines of this room dates

equipment~
 
   It is a matter of good manners to adorn your body with the finest
equipment Northern Crossroads has to offer.  Each piece of equipment
is unique and offers a variety of benefits.  When outfitting oneself,
always have a full complement of eq.  Even if pieces are crappy, they
still provide some help.  At lower levels, look for equipment that
will increase your armour class and have spell like components such
as sanctuary and haste.  At higher levels, seek out items which
increase your damage and hitroll.  Always carry recall scrolls, and
have plenty of healing type potions in your inventory.
NOTE:: Mobs which breath will destroy equipment carried in inventory,
so keep your eq in containers, these are unharmed by breath.
  
~
E
avatar~
 
   Avatars possess the skills of all classes.  A person becomes an
avatar by first reaching level 50/50 and then praying at the shrine
in Paladine.  All skills are reset once you avatar and will have to
be learned anew.  Fear not, avatars do not use practices for this.
Avatars learns skills/spells by failure.  Everytime you fail in an
attempt, you become more versed in that skill/spell.  Some skills
are easy to learn right away.  For example, just type peek e about
100 times, the skill should be learned to the best of your ability
after that.  Other skills just take time.  Levelling is different
for avatars too; levelling is done automatically when the XP point
is hit for the next level, so make sure your stats are all 18.
Beware, as an avatar you must watch your EGO points, if they drop
below 0 due to fleeing, you will lose 10 hp everytime you flee
after that.  
 
~
E
mobs1~
 
   Since killing mobs is the only way to get XP and a good source
of gold and treasure, it is likely you will come to blows with them
more than a few times.  Heed the following advice:
 
   Attacking: Letting mobs have the first attack allows you to better
use warrior/thief skills against them.  Different ways of doing this
include: stealing gold until the mob catches you, rescueing someone
who is already attacking, if the mob is aggresive, just waiting for
it to get up the nerve to swing at you.  During your attack, be sure
to have plenty of healing potions in your inventory.  Do not be shy
about using them either.
 
   Spells: Some mobs are very tough and should be spelled up to
prevent them from killing you.  Use 'dispel magic' to get rid of
sanctuary, 'blindness' to lower their chance to hit and prevent them
from attacking the weak group members, 'guinness' is the best; it
makes it very hard for a mob to hit you (usually).
 
~
E
levels~
 
   Of course one of the primary objectives in the mud is to seek
out experience and gain levels.  When you level, it is always best
to maximize all benefits derived from levelling.  That is, getting
the most pracs possible, the most hit points, and when training in
skills/spells, doing so with the least number of practices used.
The way to do this is to ensure that your WIS/CON are at 18 when
you level, and that your INT is at 18 when you practice.  There
are two ways to do this.  One, use your practices to train your
stats up at Bozo's.  The second is you outfit yourself with equip-
ment that raises your abilities.  Note, this equipment does not
have to be worn outside the times of levelling and training skills.
Note::  It does not hurt to equip your self with this 'levelling
equipment', even if your stats are already 18.
 
~
E
stats~
 
   You have 5 base stats for your char.  Strength, Intelligence,
Wisdom, Dexterity, and Constitution.
 
   Strength     - determines how much weight you can carry and how 
                  many items you can hold in inventory
   Intelligence - determines how fast you learn skills/spells when
                  you practice them
   Wisdom       - determines how many practice sessions you get
                  each time you level
   Dexterity    - helps to determine how succesful you are when
                  thief/warrior skills used
   Constitution - determines how many hit points you get each time
                  you level
 
   It is advised that you get all these abilities to 18 as soon as
possible.
 
~
E
mobs2~
 
   Breath Weapons: Some mobs breath fire, lightning, gas, frost, and/
or acid.  All of these but acid will destroy equiment carried in your
inventory, so keep stuff in your containers (these cannot be harmed).
Acid is nasty, few mobs breath acid, it destroys the AC that comes
from your equipment.  Do not fight acid mobs with good equipment on.
 
   XP: There are caps on how much XP you get depending on your level.
Level whenever possible so that your cap goes up.  Mobs that are below
or equal to your level only give 1/2 XP, so seek out mobs stronger
than you (but not so strong they will kill you).
 
   Wimpy: Wimpy is a setting that allows you to flee from mobs when you
are hurt.  Wimpy is toggled on and off by typing wimpy alone.  To set
the level at which you want to flee, type: wimpy #.  The number is the
number of hitpoints at which you will attempt to flee.  Note that some
mobs are so tough, that you want to set your wimpy equal to your max hp.
 
~
E
warriors warrior~
  
   High hit points and the following skills make warriors a good class.
 
   Block:    This prevents wimpy mobs from fleeing.  This skill
             remains active until toggled off.
   Dragon P: This has the chance to stun the mob for 3 rounds.
             Total failure causes you to fall down and you must
             then stand up before attempting another skill.
   Parry:    You are able to parry the mobs attacks with this.  A
             message reading 'back to the attack' means you are no
             longer parrying and must reapply the skill.
   Pummel:   Succesfully applied, this will stun the mob for the
             next attack round.  Complete failure will cause you
             to lose two rounds of attack, or, if you are assisting
             someone, will cause you to drop out of the fight.
   Rescue:   Removes the person being attacked from the fight and
             makes you the primary target.
   
~
E
thieves thief~
 
   Thieves possess many excellent skills which are outlined below:
 
   Backstab: This causes a great amount of damage to the mob and has
             a chance of stunning it for 3 rounds.  No matter what,
             you will be unable to take any action for 3 rounds.
   Block:    This prevents wimpy mobs from fleeing.  This skill remains
             active until toggled off.
   Circle:   Apply this skill during a fight and you will do damage
             to the mob.  You also have a chance of stunning the mob.
   Peek:     One of the best skills.  Allows you to see into the next
             room.  When it says 'You get a bad feeling..', this is a DT!
   Sneak:    This allows you to slip through the shadows without players
             or mobs being aware of your presence.  The spell 'sence life'
             counters this ability.
 
~
E
clerics cleric~
 
   Clerics are a strong class that possess both good hit points and
many defensive spells.  Some of these spells are listed below:
 
   Armor:        This spell increases your AC and is always wise to have.
   Bless:        Gives you a better chance of hitting mobs in battle.
   Blindness:    Mobs unable to cast spells at you and worse chance to hit.
   Dispel Magic: Removes spells from mobs/items.
   Guinness:     Definately the best spell on the mud.  A guinnessed
                 mobs chance of striking you is greatly reduced when drunk.
   Heal:         Cures up to 100hp in damage.
   Imp Bless:    You damage bonus is increased with this spell.
   Magical Vest: Lowers your AC by a significant amount.  Effectiveness
                 increases with level.
   Rune of Prot: Prevents aggresive mobs from attacking.  Some mobs are
                 anti-rune and will attack through this spell.
   Sanctuary:    Mobs do half damage to you when you are sanced. Priceless!
 
~
E
mages mage~
 
   Well, here is the ugly truth.  Mages are by far the weakest class on
the mud.  They have poor hit points and most of their spells do not seem
to balance the character.  However, some of the better spells follow:
 
   Armor:        This spell increases your AC and is always wise to have.
   Blindness:    Mobs unable to cast spells at you and worse chance to hit.
   Blink:        Returns you to the spot marked.  Used with Mark.
   Detect Invis: Lets you see invisible mobs and items.
   Dispel Magic: Removes spells from mobs/items.
   Haste:        Speeds you up and gives you an extra attack each round.
   Infravision:  Allows you to see in the dark.
   Mark:         Marks a spot to be returned to later.  Used with Blink.
   Shield:       Reduces your AC.  Also handy.
   Solar Flare:  Causes high damage to those cast at.
   Visitation:   Allows you to go to players/mobs the same or lower level.
                 Anti-visit eq and some mobs block this spell.
 
~
E
shop shops~
 
   There are various shops about which provide goods and services.
Use 'list' to see what a shopkeeper has.  Below is a list of some
helpful ones:
 
   Blacksmith:  Keeps your eq in tip top shape.  'Offer all' to see
                the cost of repairs.  "Rep all' to fix 'emp up.
   Healer:      Sells a variety of potions; especially teals which heal.
   Alchemist:   Sells helpful potions including sanctuary. Olympus
                Alchemist has ambrosia which are nice healing potions.
   Mage Shop:   Sells detect invis potions and improved id scrolls.
   Armourer:    Buys and sells armor type eq.
   Weaponsmith: Buys and sells weapons.
 
~
E
eat eating drink drinking~
 
   Like real life, you get hungry and thirsty on the mud.  Now
pay attention, it is not always a good idea to listen to your
bodies signals.  First off, there is only a certain amount
you can eat and drink.  If you eat or drink to capacity, then
you will not be able to do either until your desire returns.
Now, your rate of hit point, mana, and energy regain is linked
partly to your current level of hunger and thirst.  If these
desires are satisfied, you will refresh faster.  Here are two
reasons not to keep these desires always totally fulfilled: 
   1) If you are hasted and a spell wears out, your energy will
      drop to 0.  Eat to maximize your energy.
   2) Chocolate milk is a god send.  It regains your hit points
      and mana and will temporarily take them about max.  If
      you keep yourself continually hungry and thirsty, then
      you will be able to drink lots of choco when you need to
      recover quickly or go into battle with big hit points.

The Millenary Forest Maze~

  You're standing on the branch of a huge  tree, 200'
  tall or more. The branch  is as  thick as a regular

The Millenary Forest Maze~

  You're standing on the branch of a huge  tree, 200'
  tall or more. The branch  is as  thick as a regular
  tree trunk.  Even taller trees surround yours.  The
  trees canopies touch one  another in  an  intricate
  aerial maze of branches and leaves.  The foliage is
  so thick that you can barely see a yard away.  It's

Ouch! This place is wild!  Here you see Club (<B>)
Guards relaxing on their night off exactly as they see
A relaxing night should be - Moshing into the walls, each
other and innocent bystanders as hard as possible.  Swarming
above the dancefloor, dangling from the glowing discoball are
strangely colored Blue-White n' Red Killer (<B>)'s swooping
down and killing pathetic dancers who are unprepared
for the power of the Dance {BLUE}({blue}<{RED}B{red}>{BLUE}){blue}'s prefered fighting

demon preschool~
In this zone, there is a nightlight, training potty , Uzi 9mm.
There are no dt's that i know of, and i explored about 99% of the zone..so
feel free to roam around.

From mk[], go s, 4w, s, e, open door, n, open glass, e, take all desk, w
From Entryway of the Demon Spawn Pre-school and Day care....
Training potty is  : 4n, unlock/open door, e, kill toilet monster
Nightlight is      : 4n, 2w, open half, 2w, kill 3.mob

arctic circle~
 
For groups of levels 35-40 (or avatars) before trying it. It may be
soloed by high hp avatars.  From Mk[],s,3e,2s,10w,s,3u,s,2w,s,2w,n,
2w,n,e,3n,w,n.  At the landing go w,n and you will be in the
Arctic Circle(Permafrost Forest).  Eq includes Owl Wings, Polar Bear
Gauntlets, Whalebone Plate, Walrus Tooth, and some other good stuff.
The cold causes you to lose about 1 hp per shiver so you need good hp
or mana for healing.  Blue whale has whalebone plate, and he is hard....
Polar bears are somewhat hard because the mob hunts you.  So have backup
and rescue a lot.  There are no dt's that I know off, so when you get to
zone you can just hunt the mob with the eq you want.   The mobs are
scavengers and will loot your corpse if you die, so do not die.  Going
after the blue whale you must go under water.  This will cause you to
lose 15 hp every breath and magic does not work in the whale's room,
so be cautious here.  Gate demons and hunt them.  Have fun.  ** Blade **

x-mansion1 x1 mansion1~
 
From Mk[]: 21e u gets you to the edge of the forest.
Reavers and Sentinels are blocking mobs and if they're in the same
room will have to be killed to get past.  Good xp for their toughness
so if you want to level quickly (as avatar) I like 'm better than 
zombies.
The area has some decent midlevel equipment and the avatar part has
magnetos cape, which is comparable to belldandy but much easier to get.
From the edge of the forest go 2e,2n,e,2n,s,e to the entrance of the mansion.
Open gate.  In the mansion the friends of humanity are agg, but not through rune.
To get to avatar area: 2n open entrance n w s and kill xavier, open underground
then d,3e,n kill forge, open simulator and go e.
Simulator 1 has Mastermold and his armor, the sentinels assist and are
different from the sentinels outside mansion.

E
x-mansion2 x2 mansion2~
 
Simulator 2 has Magneto and 5 acolytes, same story as sentinels. Blind them!
The way to fight Mastermold and Magneto is to pummel them and flee to a
magic room, calm and then spell 'm up.
Simulator 3 has war,pestilence,famine,death and the tough one, Apocalypse.
war, pestilence, famine, and death do not assist and can be dealt with
seperately.
Apocalypse is tough, need a big group of avatars, try to lure him to a magic
room. There's 2 no magic rooms there, but he hunts.  4-5 avatars should be
able to kill him I think.
Rest of mansion is mid-level and can be soloed by an avatar, group up if
you're not avatars.  Its pretty straightforward and the equip that can
be found is, among other things, beasts backpack, Storms badge, X-belt,
Gambits Ace ('card' is keyword), cyclops visor, wolverine claws.
I think its a pretty good area with decent equip for the mobs that are
there.
 
           Have fun!  Sloth/Vapor

From Mkt [] 11w, n, 3u. 
This is the top of the mountain... to the south is the airship where Paladins
Shield comes are from.
Lower Level Area:
North of the top of the mountain is an area where players of lvl 20+-30+ can
get good exp. Also in this area are Genji gloves, Offering, and Thornlet helmet.
The mobs with the eq. are for mid- to hi level non-avatars... though i would
suggest grouping to kill them as a non-avatar.
Higher Level Areas:
Deep 13... from mountain top, n, 5w, open rock, 2n, 3e, d, n, open secret.
This is where Old invention exchange is on Joel Robinson. Have good hp or

hell~
 
Hey guys I have provided you with these directions to hell:
Start at Market Square go: 14e,3n,2e,2n,w,2n,u,4w,4n,
7e,2s,3e,3s,3w,3u,4e,6n,4w,3s,4e, Open Rock, n,4d,e,3d,s,2e,3s,3w,
2s,e,d,3e,2n,e,d,e (**SPELL UP HERE...RUNE OF PROTECTION PROT. EVIL, ETC**)
one east leads to the Hell Guardian blocking the Great Door to Hell. As
far as i know there is no DT's in this area, unless you not flying in the
great sea on the way to the leviathon mob.  So when in the Great Sea cast
fly upon yourself to save youself any hassle.  These mobs are tough.  The
recommended group is 3 to 6 avatars.  Good luck and have fun.  There is
some good eq to be won.
                             Seiji

gilligans island~
 
From m[] s,3e,2s,2w,8s,2e,7s  which will land you on the beach.  Lots of
native warriors to kill for midlevel characters, with good xp (lvl 20-30).
From there:  3s,w,2s,e,s,3e will get you to the entrance of the Camp.
In the camp you can go to:
* The Howells:  swsws
* Skipper and Gilligan: 3sws2w (gilligans hat,shirt and boots)
* Professor: s2es2es (professors glasses)
* Giner and Mary Anne: s2esese2ses  (Gingers dress)
All the mobs give good xp, mr Howell carries 2mil in coins.
I'd suggest level 30 and up for these mobs and bring lots of teals.
They do hit hard (if they hit :)
Also, you can go visit the cave and the warrior chief. No good equip.
From the campentrance to the cave:
e,6s,e,4s,3e,5s,2w,2s,w
     Have fun and happy hunting!   ....Vapor

  This room, with its counter,  desk-bell,  and table 
  lamp cannot be other than the Club <B> reception to
  the members quarters.  A smiling pretty girl in re-
  ceptionist outfit gives you the keys to your  room,
  winks at you suggestively, and asks if you're  need
  any help in your room.  On the wall you see:
 +--------------------------------------------------+
 |  It's a hallway to chamber quarters you see;     |
 |  But wrapped in sweet dreams is                  |

  furniture completes the room apart from two  sofas,
  both near a fireplace.  The coat of  arms of Club B

The Millenary Forest Maze~

  You're standing on the branch of a huge  tree, 200'
  tall or more. The branch  is as  thick as a regular
  tree trunk.  Even taller trees surround yours.  The
  trees canopies touch one  another in  an  intricate
  aerial maze of branches and leaves.  The foliage is
  so thick that you can barely see a yard away.  It's
  impossible to see the  sky above,  even this  high. 
  The forest floor is 150' below you, lost in perpetu
  al darkness down there. A fall from here would be.. 
  ... your last one!

The Millenary Forest Maze~

  You're standing on the branch of a huge  tree, 200'
  tall or more. The branch  is as  thick as a regular
  tree trunk.  Even taller trees surround yours.  The
  trees canopies touch one  another in  an  intricate
  aerial maze of branches and leaves.  The foliage is
  so thick that you can barely see a yard away.  It's
  impossible to see the  sky above,  even this  high. 
  The forest floor is 150' below you, lost in perpetu
  al darkness down there. A fall from here would be.. 
  ... your last one!

   The alcohol sits in your neck.  The lights cause your pupils
to fold in on themselves.  Is there no end to the madness.

Your Pal The Welder~

  It is nice to have a neighbor with his own acetlyne 
  torch. Just plop your broken goods down on his work
  bench. He will get them fixed up for you  "toute de 
  suit".  That is "in no time at all!".
