  You don't like the look of this place.  The sky is overcast
  and you hear an occasional crow cawing.  The clearing itself
  also seems out of place somehow.  You can't seem to figure
  out what exactly it is about this place that gives you the
  creeps.  Maybe it's the TV sitting in the center of the
  clearing.  How weird...

Just wait till you get your hands on Mr. Burns...
