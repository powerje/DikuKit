Applied Cryogenics~

  As you go flying through a portal you come out carrying
  a hot pizza box and a six-pack of Olde Fortran addressed 
  to Applied Cryogenics Lab. You are now standing in front
  of the Applied Cryogenics Lab. There's a glass door leading 
  into the lab. You take a peek through the door. All you 
  can see is a desk and against the wall there are a bunch of 
  long metallic tubes. You can't make out what's in them 
  from this distance.

Cryogenics Lab~

  All along the wall there are long metallic tubes. You go
  up to one of them, you touch the glass window. The glass 
  is cold and the window has like frost covering the inside. 
  You try to wipe away the frost from the glass and inside 
  you see a person. Looks like they are like frozen in there. 
  Just below the window there seems to be some sort of dial
  and a display window next to it. Looks like the dial is for 
  setting the years a person will be frozen in the tube. Hmm
  they're all set for 1000 years.

Probulator~

  As you enter the Probulator room, you see a robotic
  probulator attached to the ceiling. Just underneath
  it you see a table. Across the room there's a lab tech 
  sitting at a control panel. He tells you to strip naked
  and lie down on the table. As you lay there you start 
  to float a few inches off the table butt naked. The 
  probulator starts to spin above you. Then you hear the
  tech say, "Ok it's about to start!"

Cryogenics Lab~

  You enter the lab, looking around you don't see anyone
  here.  You yell out "Is I. C. Weiner" here? I got your 
  pizza here. But all you get back is dead silence. You've 
  just been made a fool. So you go sit down at the desk and 
  you put your feet upon the desk and lean back and eat the 
  pizza yourself. Your so pissed that you lean back too far 
  and you fall back into a cryogenic unit and your instantly 
  frozen.

New York City~

  As you drive along the streets of New York City you see 
  up ahead of you a crowd of firefights, police officers, 
  construction workers, rescue people. You slow down to
  see what they are doing. They're standing in front of
  what used to be the World Trade Center towers complex. 
  Standing near a podium you see a man in a suit wearing 
  glasses. He's addressing the crowd. You can't quite make 
  out what he's saying but hes pointing to what looks like
  a damaged golden sphere with spotlights pointing towards
  the sky. There are two bright lights aimed at the sky. As
  you get closer to the podium you can see whos talking. 
  Its the former mayor of New York City, Rudy Giuliani. 
  He's honoring the people who lost their lives in the
  World Trade Center plane crash on September 11, 2001.

New York City~

  Driving down the highway, going towards New York City.
  There seems to be gridlock up ahead, a lot of cars are 
  trying to get into lanes for the toll booth. Up ahead 
  you can see the Holland tunnel. Off towards your right 
  there are cargo ships carrying lots of cargo containers. 
  After paying the toll you try to squeeze your car into
  1 of the 4 lanes going into the tunnel.

Holland Tunnel~

  Finally you make it into the tunnel, while trying to 
  keep within the speed limit. There are only 2 lanes in 
  this tunnel so you try to keep your car on your side of 
  the double {BOLD,YELLOW}yellow{bold,yellow} line as much as possible. You pray 
  that there aren't any leaks in this tunnel as you drive 
  along. Up ahead you see a light just around the bend. 
  Emerging from the tunnel there are signs pointing towards 
  downtown and others are pointing towards uptown. You 
  decide to go downtown.

  Driving along the highway going towards New York City.
  On your right you can see the Statue of Liberty not too
  far from there you can see the twin World Trade Centers.
  Looking towards your left you can see the Empire State
  building. You gotta do the tours at these places. You 
  speed up while continuing towards New York City.

New New York City~

  There are spaceships flying everywhere and people zooming
  through the transparent elevated pneumatic tubes. At the
  end of the tube people continue to smash into the wall.
  People would rather take the transparent elevated pneumatic
  tubes than use the jet packs to get to work. The vehicles
  in the streets don't have wheels instead they are just
  hoving a few inches off the ground. As you look up you can
  see the tall skyscrapers everywhere and more transparent
  elevated pneumatic tubes.

N.N.Y.P.D. Jail~

  There are no bars in this jail, wonder how they keep the
  prisoners from escaping. You walk towards the entrance
  and there seems to be a force field blocking your way.
  You get a big shock from it when you walked into it.
