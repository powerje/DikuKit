{BLUE}Winterhaven Square{blue}~

    A decaying wooden fountain gives you little comfort from the cold
winds which seem to blow here ceaselessly. The ground is hard as rock
and an angry grey sky greets you as you peer upwards. A strange barbed
vines seems to be the only abundant plantlife here as a strange mist
comes and goes often, tainting the plantlife as it does.

By warning of the Mayor of Midgaard, DO NOT ENTER. We recently sent in some
guardsmen to rescue children who wondered in to this land. No words from
them. Only one of their corpses was found, it had been hung from the
gate during the night with the word "REBELLION!" scraped into its chest.
It was evident he had been tortured as well. In response Midgaard has
placed this guardsman here to prevent all from entering. He has the gate's
key in case of an emergancy, and if somehow you find yourself in this land
without case, seek safety. This place could likely kill an entire group
of experienced avatars! Let alone the haunted tales of acid breathing 
monsters and traps that take your death in seconds. Adventurers, be wary...

    The road is barely noticable through the odd vines but it is there.
Sounds can be heard both north and south, probably shopkeepers in this
little miserable hole. It wouldnt surprise you if the dead haunted this
dead town as there is an unending stench of death here. The sky is more
oppressive than ever and forces you to scowl. If a beggar comes looking
for gold in the mood you're in you think you'll kill him for fun.

    The wind picks up suddenly and throws your cloak out behind you.
Bah you think, Winterhaven is a place for only the hardiest souls that
enjoy long toil and mundane tasks. The homes here are old, but the people
seem older, wrinkles complimenting thier long grey hair and calloused
hands. You wonder what else could inhabit this old town...or would even
want to.

    You can barely detect this "path" and mutter at how little the mayor
of this town seems to care about its state. The path continues far to
the east but normal noises come in almost all directions. At least the
noise of money changing hands and citizens bartering for a better deal.
Scratching your forehead you look at a tall wooden statue of a cloaked
and hooded figure. Red eyes seem to peer suspiciously from behind its
lifeless head.

    The gate is tiny and wooden and you doubt it could stop a frenzied
pig. The guardsmen here are pathetic as well, disheveld and half asleep
they couldnt stop a frenzied pig either! Muttering about a lack of
safety you kick one of the guards and punch another. They dont even
move, only mutter and groan about housewives picking on them.

At least now you feel some sort of protection, and the guards here seem
to be awake as well! It must be your birthday, such gifts of justice
and peace are rare in the adventurers world. Besides these the wind and
sky seem to have a less saddening effect here. Its amazing what the warm
feel of safety can achieve.

    A large bronze statue dominates this part of the pathway and it
actually isnt weathered to badly. Words are scrawled at its base but
they are barely readable...something about "The Rebellion" and its effect
on the city of Midgaard. Spitting you cleanse your mouth of the name
Midgaard. Even Winterhaven is a paradise compared to that rogues hotel.

a heavily populated area. Exits branch off in all direction and common
city chatter fills the air. The wind is even blowing the stench away
from this section of town.

    This gate is heavily fortified because there are often raids from
the Orc Clans from this direction. Occassionally they'll circly in from
the North, but those are few and far between. The gate here is pure steel
of an antiquated value. You hold no doubts that once this gate is shut
it'd take a giant to tear it down.

to have given them a pessimistic outlook. They are paid exceptionally
well, almost ridiculously, for this post though so you bear them no
pity whatsoever. If they die...then its just a job opening for the ever

    The temperature warms in just a few steps creating a flurry of
shivers to grip your spine. Such a change could only be magical. Dust
is thick in the air and you cough in response, tripping on a stone 
sticking out of the...wait, that wasnt a stone it was a dwarven skull
and its pretty fresh. If you weren't alert before you are now.

{RED}A Bloodied Gate{red}~

    A long rotted wooden gate stands here with only a few supports
left standing after ages of use. The gate is shattered and rusted armor
and axes lie all around. This must be a heated point of contention for
offensive and defensive maneuvers. Skeletons also litter the entire
area, partially obsured by the sun baked grass.

    A dusty road baked by a blazing sun far overhead. Flat baked ground
stretches off in all directions and the skeletons of cleanly picked
animals dot the landscape. A harsh wind blows sand into your eyes even
as it blows some sort of annoying gnaot off of you. These are orcish
lands and your eyes peer worridly.

    Ah, the famed foothills of the Mougaik, territory of some of the
most vicious orcs you can find. Cannibals and ritualistic destroyers
of society and order. They spread chaos like you do butter on your freshly
baked bread. Not to worry though, these are merely the foothills, the
beginning of the Mountains and not much trouble should be around.

small ways to the east now. Exits go off in all directions and you are
uncertain of which to choose. North seems to be the most desolate, with
skeletons littering the area like pebbles, while south is obscured by
a non stop dust storm. East is of course the mountains while west returns
you towards the safety of Winterhaven.

They also seem to be piled somewhat meticulously, as if not the work of

pass is very narrow, with cliffs rising up both sides and undoubtedly
during a heavy winter snows must render it impassable. But now it is
alight in an autumn beauty, tall grasses still retaining a summer
green while the few trees are covred in the blaze of sunlight starved
leaves. But not to be outdone....rusted swords and armor litter the
ground as well, a few containing the petrified bones of that ancient
battle. A standard still stands tall at the passes center, magically
given life beyond its owners...it is the standard of the Silvan Falcon
which was a premier order of the Orc Clans, lost in histroy, that
once ruled most of the known world.

    Going past Huatheir brings you a few hundred feet higher which
ends abruptly and surprisingly as you walk. Amazinly a section of
the mountain seems to have shatterd, leaving a jagged descent with
an inverted slope, impossible to scale withought the right tools.
And in the wind there seems to be a soft moaning, as if the singing
of lost souls, lamenting thier past and what they wish to change.
Then you remember, these are the Singing Cliffs, so named by the
Dwarves who fled after the armies of Thress destroyed thier home...
and most of thier kin. Alas you can only turn back, the way ends

{RED}Chisled Steps{red}~

    Coming this way brings you up breathtaking heights, with even the
clouds being below you. You are following some crudes steps, carved
from a lost time as they are weathered badly and cracked from some
sort of iron root. They lead ever upward almost endlessly and even
go out of your sight, making your breaths come faster and quicker from
a lack of cleansing air.

{RED}Last of the Steps{red}~

    Breathing in heavily you gasp at the frigid air and peer around.
The steps have faded entirely, weathered to oblivion and covered by a
fine white snow. The roots no longer grow as well, the rock here
being devoid of the nutrients of life. Looking up the slope continues
at a dangours pace, rising hundreds of feet in only a few hundred
hand lengths as the Crow flys.

{RED}High Slopes of Moukaig{red}~

   Grimacing you suck your palm as yet another jagged rock slices you.
The going now is terrifying, a single slip could mean utter and
everlasting death, the prime equalizer. Peering downward you think
you can see the petrified trees far far away. Fortuantly for you a
small ledge moves off to the left and circles the slope somewhat.
You could either take a respite here or continue upward.

{RED}A Crumbling Ledge{red}~

    Although safer than the climb upwards the ledge is still highly
dangerous, with portions of it missing entirly. The cliff face also
tends to buldge at the most awkward spots, forcing you to kneel and
lose your balance at times. Above all this a thin watery snow has
begun to cover you making the going all the more deadly...

{RED}Collapsed Section{red}~

    An entire section of the cliff has fallen away here. No jagged
spikes or huge cracks can be seen, evidence that it happened long
ago and is not threat for now. But the ledge has been destroyed here
and the only way across is to make a god blessed leap or to trust
in the magics of flight.

Room of Creation~

    Now standing high atop a mountain with swift winds blowing the
falling snow into a crazy pattern you give a gasp of awe. From here
you can see the whole of Northern Crossroads, from the residents of
the humble Midgaard to the many outlying and oftentimes dangerous
areas. Amazingly some scrub brush has managed to survive clear up
here, but the rest of the area is marred by a serious of black spots
and deep pits as if from and explosion. Above the highest clouds
push down somewhat oppressively now, and as you look around you see
a wooden sign, weathered badly but readable... *-------------------*
                                               * Danger to Mortals *
                                               *-------------------*

...the sign is apparently old, knocked over by some lost wind, and
if there was once some form of danger here it has passed on.

{RED}Top of the Cliff{red}~

    After a few hard hours of climbing and a few bruises later you
hastily pull yourself up onto the top, a much safer and relaxing
place than hanging onto the ninety degree slope. Standing your eyes
flick over the surroundings taking in all that is important
and you pull back in surprise. A short ways to the east is a small
decline into a wooded area, odd and unusual for such heights. And
from within the trees rises a crumbling tower...

{RED}Into the Woods{red}~

    Picking up your pace you look closely at the trees which quickly
surround you on all sides. They are all dead, long dead yet not even
petrified like the ones below, but leafless and frozen. Many also
bear the markings of electrical energy, lightning or perhaps the
workings of some magician. The tower is much taller now and its
decrip state of disrepair becomes fully understood the closer you
come towards it.

{RED}Before the Tower{red}~

    The trees are very close here yet still as dead as the rest, along
with many of them twisted in what seems agonizing poses. The door to
the tower lays in splinters at your feet, blasted off by some force
similar to what must have effected the trees long ago. From here you
can see only a dark forboding interior, one which has likely not felt
the touch of mortality for a long, long time...

Base of the Tower~

    Slowly forcing yourself through the door you find yourself in an
old abandoned chamber with walls of black stone. Spiderwebs are thick,
odd that anything could live this high, and a few spent torches are
stuck in niches along the wall. There are no windows, only mirrors
in all directions except up and to the west. They are all cracked
and shattered beyond repair, some even melted into the walls oddly.
But you recognize them, they are translocation portals...the doorways
of the gods.

{BLUE}Tower of Existance{blue}~
    You stand within a sparsely furnished tower room, a single torch
is here, long ago it gave off a warm light, but now it merely appears
as a darker smudge against one of the walls. A table is here with a
shattered chair behind it, the wood of both being warped from snow
finding its way through the crumbling ceiling. On the table are maps
and scrolls which show places and reveal the history of Northern
Crossroads, yet they are ancient and crumble at your touch. Portals
similar to the ones below are seen both east and west, yet these
are intact but sealed. Covered in a strange black ice it has been
long years since they blazed forth to different worlds. A fireplace
encompasses the north wall, silent and empty but for a thin layer
of dust. Above its mantel is a decaying sword and rusted armor,
both eroded beyond usability...and above these is a small plaque
with the forboding words, "Tremson the M..." Alas the rest is
indescernable.

{BLUE}Falls of Final Daeth{blue}~

   Bursting through the unusual door is a mistake you shouldn't have made!
As the last fragments are torn away you rush forward only to have your feet
swept from under you, falling fully into a nearly invisible waterfall! You
can definately see it now and are heading towards death...

ENJOY...

     ...THE

           REWARDS...
                  ...OF
                       DEATH...

                            ...FFFFOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLLL! MUHAHAHAHAHA!

DEATH TRAP---DEATH TRAP---DEATH TRAP---DEATH TRAP---DEATH TRAP---DEATH TRAP

...if you are still alive you had better thank the gods and get the hell out
of here!

{BLUE}Cave of Darkness{blue}~

    Walking into this surprising cave you instantly know it as a mistake.
Deep and unbreakable darkness envelops you instantly and the reek of death
permeates the area. Jagged stones litter the floor and the drop of water
echos constantly, the small jittering of animals is heard while red eyes
occassionaly appear. The sense of evil here is almost too much and you
crouch as a wave of nausea overcomes you. A hoarse crackling voice sounds
within your mind, speaking only a few simple words, "Flee while you can..."
it repeats. Over and over it says those words almost driving you insane.
Gaining your wits is a strenuous test of will yet you do as the voice says.

Another large boulder is misplaced here. Unlike the other this one is
midnight black and saturated with blood. A warning against Death Traps is
scrawled upon it....heed the words of the wise young one...
