forest path~
The path that you've been following curves eastward, deeper into the
forest. The sounds of chirping birds surround you, filling you with a sense
of inner peace.  Looking around, you see that this path has been seldom
tread, and you're certain you can rest here without being disturbed.

Narrowing path~
A sense of urgency grips you as you see the path that you've been following
begin to narrow.  The trees around you seem darker and more foreboding.  You
decide to backtrack, but no path lies behind you!  Instead, the trees seem to
have risen up and created a wall of branches to block your way.

APC~
If the outside wasn't strange enough, the inside leaves you in disarray.  Two
long benches line the walls on one end.  Tough, fabric straps dangling from 
everal places.  Several square-opaque glass pieces are set into the walls at
ye-level, yet their purpose is a mystery.  To the other end of the vehicle are
large windows that allow you to see the masonite structure from another angle. 
You conclude that this must be wizard's transport, since strange gems are set  
into the metal tables below the windows, blinking in a myriad of colors.  One
particular glass pane catches your eyes, light blinking across it's surface.

charred with large, black streaks, and deep gouges marr the once smooth
surface. You look around uncomfortably, expecting the beast to reappear at

As you enter, you turn around just in time to see the doors shut with a large
clang! Steeling yourself for what may lie ahead, you examine your
surroundings. It is very dark here, but your light source does show that
there must have been a great battle here.  Large scraps of metal lie on the
floor and strange instruments of war lie in disarray.  You carefully examine
the walls and see the same gouges you notices earlier, and melted steel from
what must have been a huge fireball.  Water leaks through grates in the
ceiling, where you see more melted steel.  Upon further inspection, the
liquid dripping from the ceiling is acid!  It's drops fizzling on the floor
below. You step back in fear.
