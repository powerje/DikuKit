   The small concrete sidewalk you stand on seems to lead
 around to the left side of the building. The concrete looks
 new and bleach white. The grass on the left side of you is
 green and neatly trimmed. To your right between you and the
 building is a small row of hedges.

  As you open the closet door, the smells of lysol and pine
 almost knock you off your feet. Obviously, this area is used
 as storage for the janitor's cleaning supplies. You see most
 the things you would expect to see. Mops, brooms, buckets,
 paper towels, and many unknown chemicals are scattered about
 the area.

  You can now determine that the noise you heard is, in fact,
 several different people holding a conversation in the room 
 to your left. You can see partially inside the room. A man
 sits at a table with his back to you. He seems to be deep in
 conversation with the other people in the room... He pauses
 for a second and takes a bite out of something between two
 slices of bread... That must be the employee breakroom.

 wondering how to respond, as she surveys you from head to toe.
 You cringe, as she sticks out her tongue and wets her lips.
 The voice in your head screams, 'Get out! Get out quick!'

{bo,R}Administration Lobby{bo,r}~
{C}
  A red throw rug lies on the floor here running both straight
 ahead and to either side. A large rack of magazines sits in
 one corner of the room. A small coffee machine and a payphone
 sit in another. You can see elevator doors to your east. The
 security desk is straight ahead, in front of you. Behind you,
 you see a closed door marked '{bo,R}EXIT{bo,C}'.

A Dark Tunnel~

The foul stench of sewer is quite a putrid one isn't it? You can feel your
stomach turn as you move ahead. Animals of some type can be heard scurrying in
the distance up ahead. Hope you your light source remains in good working 
condition.

  Ugghhh! Your inside the compactor! But wait... whats this? There is no
 large press, only a large robot. He doesn't really seem to notice the
 difference between flesh and cardboard though, watch out for those huge
 blades!

{M}The Compactor{m}~
{C}
   A man is here busy unfolding a large mound of boxes, 
 and throwing them into a huge compactor. He looks pretty
 upset. You hear him muttering something to himself about
 long hours and bad wages. He notices your movement and
 briefly looks up at you.
