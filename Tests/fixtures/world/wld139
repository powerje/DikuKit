The Altar of the Dark Queen~

  The haze of the evil that composses the hallway slowly coalesces into
  a more solid, familiar type of terrain. Unfortunately, the relief of solid
  does not last long, for you find yourself in the most horrific of places
  imaginable. An altar, made of bone and gold, and serpent skin, lies blood
  stained in the center of the room. Standing in back of it is a portal,
  the likes of which you have never seen. Five dragon heads, form a circle
  around a mirror. Each head a different color, black, white, blue, green,
  red, and each caught in an act of what looks to be a scream of exquisite
  agony. Looking through the mirror, you see a land that twists and convulses,
  ever-changing, chaotic. You look upon the Abyss, the home of the dark
  queen herself. You have entered the home of the Dark Queen herself. You
  have reached the Altar of Takhisis, Goddess of Evil.

The Halls of the Pantheon~

  You move to the south, through the thick haze until you finally reach
  a place where you must rest. As you sit for a moment, collecting your
  breath and your wits, to doors on opposite sides of the "Hall" matierlize.
  Though you may still continue to the north, and south, you feel a very
  distinct evilness, even more than the rest of this place, emanating from
  the south.

The Realm of Xilaminirstiff~

  Xilaminirstiff, the god of Ice and Hate, stands here before you. He rests
  upon a large throne made of Ice and blood. A large pit directly in the middle
  of the room emits a torent of snow that fills the room almost completely. The
  severed head of the Christkind is mounted on the wall above a small table of
  ice.

The Realm off Zebiom~

  Zebiom, the Goddess of the Great Seas, is the evil daughter of Sargonnus
  and Takhisis. She was banished to this hollow room for betraying her father
  to the dark god Soth. She must live out her life as a hobbit, never inter-
  reacting with another life. She stands before you, floating in midair. A 
  large black cloud fills the room, and sends an odd sensation through your
  body. Two large heads, one dragons the other human, have beed mounted on the
  far northern wall. A large hole in the ceiling casts a golden light down
  upon Zebiom's massive head.

  and blood. A small fountain, spirting out blood, rests in the middle
  of the room. The Halls of the Pantheon stretch out in all directions 
  from this point, and a great evil can be felt eminating from the south.

  the sides of the walls, splattering your once clean boots with fresh
  droplets of blood. A warm breeze slowly fills the hot chamber making your

  A large pool of human blood rests in the middle of the room. Human
  flesh, torn from human bodies, caovers the blood red floor. The head
  of Zeus, god of Olympus, has been mounted above a large table made of
  bone. Various parts of human anatomy cover the table, dripping with
  fresh blood. The walls, made of flesh, are ripped and torn at numerous
  places. A hollow, methodical laughter can be heard echoing off of the
  walls, filling your entire body with dread.

The Abyss~

  The Abyss is a plane of shear chaos, whose only method of madness
  can be discerned by its owner, the Queen of Darkness. The terrain in
  front of your eyes even as you watch change from, Tropical Rainforest,
  to Desert, to Frozen Tundra, and what you see never truly matches what
  you feel you are standing on. Going is difficult at best.

The Halls of the Pantheon~

  A cold chill runs up your spine as you notice the walls made of human
  flesh and blood. Huge pillers of human bone support the golden ceiling 
  just inches above your head. Two small rivers of blood flow freely down
  the sides of the walls, splattering your once clean boots with fresh
  droplets of blood. A warm breeze slowly fills the hot chamber making your
  wet clothes stick even more to your taunt body.

The Ladder Withen the Well~

  As you make your way down the wooden ladder you notice that the walls
  of this well are made of a substance that is unfamiliar to you. The dark
  black bricks seem to suck out all the light that comes from the sun above.

The Mouth of the Well~

  You are standing on the very lip of the stone well. As you peer into
  its large opeing you see a small glimmer of light from deep withen the
  hole. You also notice that small wooden ladder has been built into the
  side of the well, making easy access up and down the well possible.

A Clearing~

  You seem to have wandered into a small clearing. Sitting to one side
  of the clearing is a water well. It appears to be constructed from rocks
  that have been collected from around the area.

As you examine the well more carefully, you notice that a small stone
seems to be quite loose withen the wall... You ponder on this for a
moment and think, 'That's almost big enough to fit a man...'

A Small Trail~

  The wind blows small pockets of dust off of the trail and onto your
  clean clothing. The sweet sound of bluebirds can be heard from the small
  thicket on both sides of you. The bright sun beats down and warms your
  weary soul. To the west you see the great town of Midgaard, while back
  to the east you notice that the path continues onward.

An Intersection~

A Dusty Path~

  The trail start to narrow as you continue to the south. All about you
  the world seems to shift. The wind begins to blow harder, the once billowy
  clouds overhead are now black and block all light from the sun. A small
  clearing can be seen to the south, while the path continues onward to the
  north.

The base of the fountain is surrounded by hundreds of small red roses. Ivory,
chipped from the fountain, lay about the small bed of roses.
