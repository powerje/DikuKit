{BLU,BOLD}Julli Oasis{blu,bold}~
 {G,BO}
  You have just entered the Julli Oasis. It is shocking
  that such a beautiful,  thriving place could exist in 
  the middle of the {R,BO}Red Sands{G,BO}. In olden times, it was a
  custom of each caravan to plant a tree or bush here as
  they arrived.  The water flows abundantly, and fodder
  for the animals is plentiful.

{BLU,BO}The Well of Hearts{blu,bo}~
  {G,BO}
  Standing at the {BLU,BO}Well of Hearts{G,BO}, you are surrounded
  by a throng of the nomads. Among them you note the
  appearance of the Aqir and the Bershak. Everyone's
  attention appears to be focused on getting a drink
  of the sweet, refreshing water from the deep well.
  Slowly, you edge your way to the well's edge.

  The penalties are severe for bringing the touch

  burns in a bronze dish, three paces wide. Around
  the fire the members of the Aqir tribe and their
  guests are gathered. Stories and wine are shared
  freely.

  You are standing knee deep in the cool, restoring
  lake at the center of the {G,BO}Julli Oasis{BLU,BO}. Nomadic men
  and women splash each other with the invigorating
  waters.  Cackles of mirth escape from the lips of
  the otherwise solemn people. It feels good to have
  enough water to drink and bathe in after a section 
  of the long, hot journey through the Red Sands.

  roaming about the livestock,  examining harnesses
  and the packages strapped to each horse and camel.

{BLA,BO}A Deep Niche{bla,bo}~
  {BLA,BO}
  This niche is deeper than most of the others.  A
  dark  figure rises up with a clanking of chains. 
  Chained to the wall is a portly man of middle age.
  {bo,Y}Bronze{BLA,BO} fetters chain him to the wall. He prays to
  Agma for divine intervention,  because he has no
  wish to become another skeleton lining the dungeon
  of the Sultan. However, you don't seem to be the

  You wing your way up higher in the 'strelli flue.
  The rough black lava rock has been smoothed over
  time to a shiny black. It looks like solid black 
  marble. Colorful platforms are placed at varying
  heights in the flue for the 'strelli to perch on.
  The flue extends on up.

  The tall flues are on either side, and it is possible
  to see how they were prepared. The pip'strelli carved 
  openings in the sides, smoothed out the interiors, and
  installed platforms inside. Some of the flues are more
  than fifty paces high and house more than one hundred
  pip'strelli.

  People of all nationalities pack the streets

  a group of guardsmen are blocking spectators

  These guardsmen don't seem to believe that you

  Nestled down in the bottom of the palace for added 
  protection is the royal conference room, where the
  conclave is now taking place. It seems to be going
  well, with all of the representatives in agreement
  that the Sultan is a dirty, rotten, lying, no-good
  son of a jackal.  (Which you could have told them) 
  Marix is present with the royal seal of Narsia. It
  seems that the conclave is a great success.

 {BLA,BO}
  A path winds its way out of the 'strelli village 
  on into the crater. Two massive flues jut out of 
  the landscape ahead. They are the Joj Xarar. The
  fire from these sacred chimneys has been put out
  by the evil general Ubrith Zelka and his band of 
  gnoles.

  The twin flues of the Joj Xarar are just ahead.
  Around the base of the pip'strelli's two sacred
  chimneys the band of gnoles can be seen as well 
  as heard. Their harsh voices rise with a frenzy
  of hate and bloodlust, as they exalt their evil
  commander General Zelka.

  Gnoles are gathered around the twin chimneys of

  the sacred fires have been extinguished. A true

  'strelli before continuing his adventures.

  Between the Joj Xarar stands a powerful gnole.
  Ubrith Zelka shouts at his hoard to catch you,
  dead or alive. To the west the immense flue of
  Joj Mirar stretches into the sky, while to the
  east, Joj Shanar parallels its twin. It appears
  that you won't be able to light either of them 
  without evading or killing the gnoles.

  You are climbing up the steep flue of Joj Mirar.
  The rope you have wrapped around the flue to aid

  you can hear the angry bellows of the gnoles.
