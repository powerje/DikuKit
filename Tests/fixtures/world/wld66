The Beginning of the End~

A great peril has entered the land.  For there is someone around who 
wishes to resurrect one of the eight parts of the God of the Monsters, 
Shabranigdo.  He was once entrapped and split into eight pieces.  Once in 
a time long ago, someone resurrected one piece of Shabranigdo, and it 
took the Dragon God to destroy it, but his life was lost in the process.  
If this person or group succeeds, then all will be lost as the world will 
be overrun by monsters, and human life will cease to exist except as 
meals for the monsters.  A sign seems to have been placed recently for 
the ground around the post is still freshly dug up.

It's a world of fantasy, where magic rules and monsters lurk around every 
corner. This is where you'll find the wackiest bunch of fantasy 
characters ever to set out on a quest!  There's cute little Lina, a 
fireball-hurling sorceress, a handsome mercenary swordsman named Gourry
the mysterious Zelgadis, and the great humanitarian sage Rezo.

You will be playing the part of the hero and heroine, {BOLD}{YELLOW}Gourry {BLUE}Gabrieve{bold} and 
{BOLD}{RED}Lina {CYAN}Inverse{bold}, as they go about to stop this evil in the land, not knowing 
what will come around the corner next.

A trail in a forest~

It all started when the infamous Bandit Killer Lina Inverse was following
this trail, in search of some more treasure.  The trees here don't seem 
to be too thick, but the leaves are abundant.  There is a path amongst 
the trees, and it seems to be well used.  There seems to be a few gold 
coins on the ground, as if someone was hurrying past, or maybe just being 
careless and not worrying about a few insignificant coins.  These coins 
lead somewhere, maybe to some treasure of some sort.

The trail to the Dragon Fang Camp~

Following the gold this far, it seems to continue over to the west.  The
forest seems to be a peaceful place, but there are sounds coming from 
around you.  Whether they are being made by man or beast you are not 
certain.  The sounds do seem a bit louder coming from the north.  The 
trail does not seem very well used, and fades away.

An unused trail extends into the forest~

The evergreen canopy seems to block more of the light, as the forest 
around you darkens.  A chill runs up your spine as a cold wind blows 
across your exposed flesh.  A few more gold coins sparkle off in the 
distance.  A glittering white object to the west catches your 
attention.

Now what do you do?  The forest seems to have enclosed around you.  At 
first you feel slight panic, but the longer you stay, the more peaceful 
you become.  Perhaps entering here was not a good idea.

The gate to a walled camp stands before you.  The two enormous wooden 
doors have been flung open.  Chanting and celebrating voices are 
yelling from within the camp.  Engraved above the arched gate are the 
words: THE DRAGON FANGS.  A large guard tower extends upwards from the 
gate entrance and looms above you.  Maybe entering would not be such a 
good idea.

On the trail after the woods~

After a tiring trek through the Berserker woods, you find yourself
before a quaint little village.  It seems harmless enough from the
outside, but as you look around, there doesn't seem to be any noise
from where you assume livestock would be.  You also notice that there
aren't any people in the streets or lights in the houses.  Maybe you
should go check it out.

few scattered canopy trees surround these remnants of what may have 
been a great forest. A strange feeling comes over you as you approach 
this natural abomination.

were a druid, this would be an ideal place to build yourself a cabin.  
Unfortunately, the trail is no longer visible.  Which way do you go?

The trail emerges from the depths of the destroyed forest~

You once again see the remnants of a once often used trail. The 
foliage around you begins to thicken, as the forest in front of you 
has not suffered the same fate as the one you just left. Hopefully 
this is a sign of better things to come.

Entrance to the Village~

After walking for what must have seemed like ages, you are relieved to 
see civilization in front of you. This quaint little village seems to 
be active. People are bustling around and running from building to 
building. Maybe you can finally find a nice place to eat some food and 
rest your aching bones. A small sign hangs by the entrance.

Inside the Village~

The buildings of this village are not impressive in any sense of the 
word, but the sight of people gives you a certain sense of comfort. At 
least you can take some time off, and prepare for your next challenge. 
The economy of this town must be booming, because people are moving 
around so quickly. Hard work like this must have made the existence of 
such a fine village possible.

bed frame. A pair of broken window shades indicates some sort of 
previous problem, or perhaps just a representation of poverty. This 
must be the shopkeeper's living quarters.

The Village Inn~

The modest outward appearance of the building gives no indication of 
the artifacts of comfort within this fine establishment.  A 
comfortable set of furniture is scattered throughout a rather large 
reception room. A hall extends to the back of the Inn and more than 
likely leads to sleeping quarters. The well-furnished walls are 
covered with many silk tapestries. You could get used to a place like 
this!

This part of the city is in ruins. The extent of the damage seems to 
be less evident in this part of the city. The smell of burnt flesh is 
still evident, but the smell is not as strong as before. As you look 
off in the distance, you see the part of the city, which is unharmed. 
It looks like a large building with an enormous cross on the top. Its 
too large to be a church. Maybe it's the famous Cathedral.

You remind yourself to send a complaint to the department of Parks and
Recreations as you watch the trail disappear into the increasingly 
thick flora. The sun creeps behind a mountain to the west, as a star 
filled night flood into your eye's field of vision. This terrible dark 
forest almost looks better under the starlight. Some passing clouds 
impede the light from the moon, however, keeping the forest in a 
hallow darkness.

it looks like you have just seen a fish with arms and legs in the water.
Maybe you should go investigate.

On the shoreline~

The water seems clear as glass.  The reflections from the water seems
to put you in a trance.  The sands of the beach seem to strecth on
for miles.  Where are you?  Have you walked far?  Everything looks so
peaceful and is clouding your head.  Something must be wrong, because
it looks like you have just seen a fish with arms and legs in the water.
Maybe you should go investigate.
