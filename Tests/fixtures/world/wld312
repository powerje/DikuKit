Lleu's Laboratory~
   Hanging on the walls you see tools of every imaginable kind, and some
you could never imagine. Strange liquids bubble in flasks and test tubes
contained within a strange alchemy apparatus in one corner. On a shelf
jars have been stuffed with innumerable body parts from a wide variety
of creatures. This is where brings to life is abominations.

Inside a large cage~
   You find yourself in a large, magical cage. The cage seems to somehow
adjust itself to enclose all the occupants and leave only a minimal
amount of space to move around. The bottom of the cage is strewn with
bones, blood, and half rotten carcasses. This is where Lleu watches his
creations and his captives fight to the death.

Garamond's Orchard~
   This was once the great orchard of Kind Garamond. The trees have
grown twisted and their fruits rotten. Every plant and animal seems to
be trapped in a state of decay, between life and death. You feel a presence
all around you and sense the forest itself reaching out with its will. It feels 
like hatred.
