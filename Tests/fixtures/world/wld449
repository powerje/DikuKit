{M}
   You are standing at the junction of Washington Square North
   and Washington Square West. This is a pretty quiet corner of
   the park compared to the other parts of the park. This is
   where you'll find students studying if they're serious about
   studying. To the southwest, you can hear the barking of
   several dogs.

{M}Washington Park North{m}~
{M}
   This street forms the northern border of Washington Square
   Park. Across the street, there is a row of 19th century two-
   and three-story tall brownstone buildings. Some of them are
   NYU offices; others are still private residences. From where
   you stand, you can look into the windows of some of the
   homes and fantasize about having enough money to live at one
   of the most prestigious addresses in all of New York City.

{W}A Path Through Washington Square Park{w}~
{G}
   You are {W}on a path running north and south between {G}the Arch
   and the {W}Fountain. Benches line both sides of this {G}wide path.
   NYU stud{W}ents enjoying the sun while reading their {G}latest
   assignme{W}nt take up most of the benches, but every {G}once in
   a while {W}you spot a homeless person sleeping on a b{G}ench and
   covered {W}in newspapers. You dodge a rollerblader te{G}aring down
   the path{W} and curse the day them damn things were i{G}nvented.

{M}Washington Square East{m}~
{M}
   This street forms the eastern border of Washington Square
   Park. This must be the busiest street out of the four that
   border the park, mainly because of all the NYU classes that
   are held in the 10- to 15-story buildings right across the
   street. Every day, ten times a day, for ten minutes at a
   time, this street swarms with NYU students who are leaving
   or getting to class.

{M}Washington Square West{m}~
{M}
   This street forms the western border of Washington Square
   Park. In the poorly lit street, it is easy to give in to all
   the fears one has about rampant crime in New York City.
   Unconsciously, people pick up their pace and walk a little
   faster down this street. As they go further north and closer
   to the Arch, people seem to relax a little more.

   This is the western entrance to the park. This is probably

   you want to buy doesn't do anything for your peace of mind.
   Washington Square West runs north and south of here.

{W}A Path Through Washington Square Park{w}~
{G}
   You are on a path running east and west between the eastern
   entrance and the Fountain. Benches line both sides of this
{W}   wide path. NYU students enjoying the sun while reading their
   latest assignment take up most of the benches, but every
   once in a while you spot a homeless person sleeping on a
   bench and covered with newspapers. You dodge a rollerblader
{G}   tearing down the path and curse the day them damn things
   were invented.

{M}The East Entrance{m}~
{M}
   This is the eastern entrance to the park. This spot is
   famous because this is where that little old lady crashed
   her car through the park, hitting a whole bunch of people.
   Washington Square East runs north and south of here.

{M}Washington Square West{m}~
{M}
   This street forms the western border of Washington Square
   Park. In the poorly lit street, it is easy to give in to all
   the fears one has about rampant crime in New York City.
   Unconsciously, people pick up their pace and walk a little
   faster down this street. As they go further south, people
   seem to get a little more nervous.

{M}Washington Square East{m}~
{M}
   This street forms the eastern border of Washington Square
   Park. This must be the busiest street out of the four that
   border the park, mainly because of all the NYU classes that
   are held in the 10- to 15-story buildings right across the
   street. Every day, ten times a day, for ten minutes at a
   time, this street swarms with NYU students who are leaving
   or getting to class.

   scattered throughout the library.

{M}The South Entrance{m}~
{M}
   This is the southern entrance to Washington Square Park. For
   some reason, there are always more cops here than anywhere
   else. You see two or three cops on horseback, and three or
   four cops driving around in little enclosed golf-cart type
   things. They seem to be more interested in socializing and
   watching the Village chicks than anything else. Washington
   Park South runs east and west of here.

   This junction of Washington Square South and Washington
   Square East is usually pretty lively, since many NYU
   buildings are across the street -- including the business
   school buildings -- and NYU students are always cutting
   across the park to get to their dorms on the west or north
   side of the park.
