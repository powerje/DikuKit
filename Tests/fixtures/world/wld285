Slik Creation Inc.~
Whoooo! This is where the evil genius tests out his master productions!
Bits of arms and legs, fingers and heads are floating about the place,
clearly intended to be put together in a not too admirable fashion....
Wait around long enough and you may actually get a chance to see him at
work!

Entrance to Artis~
 
 The smell of burned peanuts and soggy sandwiches assaults
 you from the goodies vending stand to the north. To the 
 west is the tram back to the central station and to the
 east you see a large black barred gate. You hear all sorts
 of loud noises coming from that direction, the roar of a
 lion, the chattering of monkeys, and many, many other sounds.
 Some of which you have never heard before.

Goodies Goodies!~
 
 A spotless little stand where the refreshments for the 
 visitors in the zoo can be bought.  They have the 
 standard stuff, like peanuts, sandwiches and sodas, but
 Goodie also sells some truly strange items, things you 
 never heard of before, like, what is, oat of Bran? 
 Or Beagle Wrap? Slightly puzzled you make your purchases,
 wondering whether you should buy some of that strange 
 stuff or not....

At the Fountain~

 You are now just inside the zoo, and can see paths
 leading in different directions from here. When you 
 look around the small plaza, you see a fountain with
 statues of exotic birds in its center. The path to the
 north has a sign that says: "Predators.  Beware!".  The
 sign next to the path that leads east tells you that 
 that is where you will find your friendly mammals.  To
 the south you can make out a sign that says that way 
 leads to the Exotic animals part of the zoo.

Monkey Business~

 You are standing on a thoroughfare between two large 
 enclosures. Inside the enclosures you can see monkeys 
 of many types, they have lots of room to roam about and
 go about their business. Monkey business! The walkway 
 you are on continues to the east, where you can see the
 long necks of giraffes in the distance.

Chimp Corner~

 After you climbed the fence to the enclosure, you dropped
 right in the middle of a whole family of chimpansees! 
 They walk up to you and examine you with mild interest.
 This must happen quite a bit since they don't seem too
 startled by strangers falling in their midst!  When you
 stand up and clean some of the dirt of your clothes, you
 suddenly notice the SMELL of these apes!  YUGH!  Gross!!

 You cautiously clamber to your feet, as you notice a 
 couple of VERY large apes coming your way. These don't
 look nearly as friendly as their companions on the
 otherside of the walkway. Big and burly looking, with
 bushy eyebrows, they seem to resent your intrusion in 
 their quiet little hideaway.

African Reminiscence~

 Around you, you can see pastures where creatures you've
 seen on television and in books before. You don't need 
 the sign to tell you that these are native to the 
 African plains. It seems a bit of an odd mixture of animals
 that they have put together.  You can see zebras next to an 
 elephant or two, gnu's next to giraffes and all of that 
 topped with a dash of antelope.

African Plains~
 
 The enclosure here is so large that you get the impression
 that you actually are in the African plains!  They did a
 really good job of recreating the natural environment of
 the animals that roam around here, who, accidentally, 
 totally ignore your presence. Having a visitor or two 
 saunter by them doesn't seem to faze them in the least!

On a Large Square~

 All around you, you see very well protected enclosures.
 These are not as large as those where the other mammals 
 are kept, but still, each one is a fair size and holds
 several animals.  You can see lions and tigers, panthers
 and wolves and many more of the more ferocious animals alive.
 All around you are warning signs, telling you to stay away
 from the animals and not to try to feed them. To the west you
 see a small building, with the door slightly ajar.

 Odds and ends of all type of work equipment, that is used
 to clean the places where the animals are kept, is lying
 around here. Also, this seems the place where they prepare
 the food for them. Big buckets of smelly remnants are piled
 in a corner, waiting to be cleaned. To the north, you notice
 a small, reinforced door.

The Bear Bivouack~

 Gnawed upon old boots, tree trunks that are torn to pieces
 and various other remnants of slaughterfests held by the 
 occupants of this cage litter the floor. It is a rather
 large area that looks like a tornado just hit, but, if 
 you look closer, you can see the occupants of the area,
 a family of grizzly bears, sitting on their haunches in 
 one of the corners.  They are chewing on something, which,
 upon closer inspection, turns out to be the remains of a
 creature that you can't immediately recognize, but that 
 looks hauntingly familiar.....

The Lions Lair~

 In a surroundings reminiscent of Africa, several large cats
 lie lazily scattered about. Truly this animal is known as 
 the King of Animals, its magnificent fur and lazy abandon,
 its arrogant look as it looks at you remind you of paintings
 of Kings and Queens, of those who feel they are not really 
 part of the world, but above it. Yet they are beautiful,
 and, maybe, dangerous.....

The Tiger Trail~

 Mostly coming from india, where they used to be hunted by the
 Maharadjas, these magnificent creatures now found a home here.
 Solitary animals as they are in the wild, these stay as far
 away from each other as possible. Only when food is brought
 into the area do they go near each other. The rest of the 
 time they observe each other warily, and, now that you have
 entered their territory, they observe you warily.....

The Water of Wolves~

 The last of the European Wolves, these gigantic animals roam
 the compound in a pack. Large warning signs are put up
 everywhere, to point out the danger that they represent. Each
 specimen is almost as big as a pony, with shaggy hair and a 
 matching attitude. Since these are the only known wolves of
 this variety, nobody knows what their reaction to captivity 
 will be, but nobody really wants to take a chance....

 see a door with a large sign on it, and the walkway to the
 north leads back to the entrance of the zoo.

In the Aviary~

 Many, so many multicoloured, screaching birds demand your
 attention as you walk about in this glass domed hall. No
 effort seems to be made to keep the birds from flying away,
 they seem to be free to roam wherever they want. Some are
 obviously so used to these masses of people traversing their
 territory that they fly up to them, sit on their shoulders 
 and pick the food out of their hands. Others feign attacks,
 but none really comes close to really attacking anybody.

 greasy gray green motif. Then, to your surprise, you can see

 Finally you found your way out of that damned Subway tube.
 When you look around, you see the remains of what must have
 at one point been a very nice subway station. Looking closely
 you can make out a plaque with what was probably the stations
 name, it is partly erased and says "Vonde  atio". Looking 
 upward, you see some daylight penetrating the broken ceiling.
 That sure gives you the idea that it might be very nice to
 leave these dark 'n damp compounds.....

Zeedijk~

 The human waste you found in the park seems to have spilled
 over into this street, the Zeedijk. Still, most of the people
 you see walking around here show at least some sign of wealth,
 at least, enough to buy a decent pair of pants or to go into
 one of the numerous bars and order a beer or two. Both sides 
 of the street are lined with bars and fast food joints, rowdy
 music spills out of many of the places and fills the air with
 a, if not gay, tantalizing feeling of.... anticipation?

Zeedijk~

 A bit further along the Zeedijk, you can see the Central
 Station somewhere to the north. A small sidestreet leads
 to another brightly lit street that you can just make out 
 to your west. To the east you see what you would have to
 call a coffeeshop, still, the fumes exiting from that 
 place make you wonder what sort of coffee they sell....

Coffeeshop "De Vijf Zintuigen"~

 Inside the coffeeshop, the heady smell becomes almost over
 powering, but, your curiousity keeps you going. A few
 people are sitting at the small wooden tables, eyes glazed
 over and they don't seem really aware of their surroundings.
 Further into the shop you can see the counter with the owner 
 of the place behind it. Maybe there you can find out just
 what is going on here.

The Coffee Counter~

 On the counter you see a menu of what they are selling here,
 your curiousity overcomes you and you take a quick peek at
 the bulky sheet of paper. It appears to have things glued to
 it. Definitely a strange menu.  Behind the counter, a thin, 
 long haired man looks up at you, indifferently, and asks you
 what you want.

Zeedijk~

 As the Zeedijk continues, you start to feel a bit more at
 ease. Here, the bars look quite prosperous, still, it all
 seems rather rowdy. One thing you know for sure, you don't 
 want to be caught alone in a dark corner here somewhere, it 
 definitely doesn't look like you would survive that....

Zeedijk~

 You've reached the end of the Zeedijk, to the north, you can
 see the central station. To the west another small alleyway
 leads to a brightly lit street. To the east, you see yet
 another bar. Boy, these people really must like their bars!

The Cockring Bar~

 Wheeeeeeee!!!!!! Now THIS is a happening place!  The music is
 WAY too loud for any kind of comfort, just the way you like
 it!  And, the women don't seem to be wearing much more than
 would naturally cling to their bodies if they ran naked
 through a wheat field and the taps are running continuously.
 Yes Sirree! This is definitely my lost home!

Cafe de Gieter~

 A rather quiet and sedate place you have found here. It
 is  not as loud and obnoxious as most of the places you've
 seen so far. Even the music is different, and, though you
 don't understand a word of what the songs they play say, 
 the few people that frequent this place seem to listen to
 them with pleasure. Most of the patrons here are older and
 settled in their ways. The tables are covered with heavy
 rugs and the bartender looks like he would rather do 
 without you patronage.

The Butterfly~

 Yuck! A disco! Time to do the discoslap!!! It has been a while
 since you saw a real live disco, most seem to have gone the 
 way of the dinosaurs but this one appears in full swing. 
 Everybody is dressed in the most obnoxious seventies clothes
 that you can possibly imagine, but wait, something is not 
 quite right. You wonder why people keep disappearing through
 a door at the side. Some of the dancers look like they just 
 went for a spin in a dryer. Something is not all what it seems...

Backchamber~

 Whoa! In shock you reel back as you enter this lavishly
 decorated room. About twenty people are strewn around the
 room, buck naked and in various states of sexual excitement
 and positions. You stumbled into an orgy! What to do now? 
 Join or run.......

Alley~

 A dark alley leads from the Zeedijk to the Walletjes and, 
 just standing here makes you uncomfortable. Dimly lit 
 windows on both sides of the alley show scantily clad ladies,
 none of them very appetizing. You wonder if there is a reason
 they got stuck in this back alley.......

Walletjes~

 You are walking in a brightly lit street, terraces are out
 here, and in every other window you observe a very lightly 
 dressed, very beautiful lady, who is definitely trying to
 catch your attention..... Maybe you should enter and find
 out what she's trying to impress on you? A little bit off
 you can see signs indicating a sex shop, and, even a sex
 museum! Things definitely seem to be happening here!  The
 streets are very, very crowded. You wonder what all these
 men are looking for here...

The Sex Museum~

  No way!  You can't believe it!  A museum dedicated to the art
 of sex? You've never even heard of such a thing. Still, the 
 displays in the entrance area are quite clear. Maybe it would
 be fun to explore the history of sex in an organized manner!

Sex Forever Shop~
 
  Looking around in this shop makes you wonder if anybody ever
 has sex in any kind of traditional way...... The whole place
 is filled with external stimulators of all manner and sort, 
 magazines, racks, whips, leather, rubber, and many, many items
 you don't even want to think about how they might be used to
 enhance the sexual experience....

Yab Yum~

 The entrance parlor of the most famous brothel in Amsterdam
 certainly lives up to its reputation.  The walls are covered
 in mirrors and a large chandelier hangs from the ceiling. A 
 hostess glides over to you from behind an ornate desk and asks
 you in a very sexy voice how she may be able to serve you.....

The Loo~

 Upon entering the toilet in this bar, you notice a very large
 man sitting on the ground next to the wash stand. He has a 
 large array of pins and instruments spread out before him.  
 Curious as to what is going on there, you draw closer and when
 you make your way through the crowd that is standing in line 
 there, you see the thick fingers of the guy deftly at work 
 inserting metal objects in very, very sensitive parts of the
 male anatomy......

The Ancient Art~

 Sex was clearly not invented in this century, and, the exhibit
 here shows that it has played a major role in many different 
 societies. What strikes you, is that in most ancient civilizations,
 sex is a part of everyday life, as natural and normal as eating and
 drinking. The brazen images that are displayed here, make you wonder
 why it is that nowadays in western civilization the art of sex is
 nearly taboo and cannot be discussed in civilized company.......

The Roman Impression~

 The ancient Romans sure had an appetite for it! It was not uncommon 
 for a powerful member of society to stage large exhibitions to 
 entertain his friends, and, the level of decadence has since not
 risen to its then glorious heights!

The Dark Ages~

 The Dark Ages of the sexual art, known as the Middle Ages by 
 most, showed the first signs of the absolute influence of the 
 Church on the thinking of western civilization. Though there
 were still patches of heathens that followed the old ways, most
 had converted to Christianity, with its particular brand of
 ethics.  Still, all was not as it seemed... behind closed doors
 many, many things were done that were explicitly forbidden...
 The strongholds of the Church were not so much an exception as
 an example of that.

The Victorian Drama~

 The Victorian age was not exactly known for its openness and 
 liberty, which was especially clear in the way the human body
 was coverd in layer upon layer of protective clothing. That 
 society has been able to survive such an ordeal can only be
 attributed to the innate pleasure inherent in consummation.

The Revolution~
  
 The twentieth century provided in some ways a breakthrough in our
 sexual thinking, definitely it is the time of the extra implements
 in Western society. Never has such an array of stimulus devices been
 available, never has research been done in the creation of mechanical
 or other type of objects to increase the pleasure found in sexual 
 encounters.

Anne's Frank~

 Anne, a statuesque blackhaired babe has covered the walls of
 her room with mirrors of all sizes and shapes. Just looking
 around the place makes you dizzy and you feel like maybe you 
 should just lie down and really see what is going on.....

 Carla, a well proportioned redhead seems to like her luxury.
 The walls are covered with expensive looking paintings, a small
 coffee table and some expensive, comfortable looking leather
 chairs are set next to the bed. Carla herself looks like she
 stepped out of a painting in Victorian England with her white
 lace dress, and you can even see a small umbrella that comes 
 with the dress.....

Domino's Dungeon~

 In the center of the room you see a woman, clad in leather,
 standing with her legs spread, one hand on her hip, the other
 softly caressing the handle of one of the vibrators that are 
 neatly stacked on the side of the room. Looking around, you 
 see shackles built into the wall, an odd looking rack occupies
 the center and many, many other very interesting looking devices.

The Boss's Place~

 Paul, the owner of the place, is known to be a very reclusive guy.
 Few have ever seen him.  He leaves the daily running of the place
 to his business manager who just stopped by to drop off the books 
 of todays proceeds. He sure seems to be wondering about what you
 are doing in his boss's quarters...

The Master Bedroom~

 This room outdoes everything you've seen so far in this place.
 It sure looks like the big ole master of it all doesn't like to
 deprive himself of anything. You can't help but wonder where he 
 got that blonde lying on the bed next to him, and, however she
 got in that postion. You sure don't wanna know. Actually, you
 were convinced a human body couldn't do that, now, can it?

Immort Quest Room~
Here, a number of Quests for wannabe IMMs are given. The idea is
to select one of the quests, and have the mort do that quest. Each
quest has 10 preliminary question, of which he has to score 8 out 
of 10, to be able to proceed to the Quest part.  
   This is supposed to be a SOLO adventure, meaning NO help from
an IMM or another mort, no use of help files etc.  Snoop player
to make sure of this.  
   Don't transfer player to this room, or, if you do, make sure
you snoop him first so he doesn't read quests since they have
answers in them.

    To select a quest, simply type:

         look quest1, quest2 etc.

More quests will be added, so if it stops at 5 one time, it may
stop at 10 the next.
