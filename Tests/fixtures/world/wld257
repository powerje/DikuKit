Welcome to the Demon Spawn Pre-School and Day Care!~
You have found your way to the day care of Northern Crossroads. You always
wondered what the people with kids did with them when they were wasting all
that time mudding. Well now you know! You can see a playground just to the east
and to your north is the Pre-school itself. Have a look around but be careful
because these kids are far from angelic.

Play Area~
At this point, it occurs to you that you have not seen a single adult in this
place. Who is watching all these kids?! This place is a mess! Kids are running
rampant! You've had to shake several off your legs so far! To the west and
south you can see a large open play area. A door is to your east. A window
to the north looks out into a yard with a huge jungle gym.

even has one of those pits full of balls. It has three levels to romp through,
and is filled with lots of little brats to put out of their misery. The
