  You are standing on a black square which
  belongs to the Black King. He would be 
  quite upset if you were to harm any of 
  his men.  In the corner stands a large
  castle made of stone. All around are the 
  remains of previous battles. This is one
  place you feel rather uncomfortable in.

  WOW!! What a climb, but it was worth it.
  You feel alive, like a new man. Sit down
  and rest. You have surely earned it. Enjoy
  this view. To the north is the {bo,W}King's castle{C,BO}.
  If you look hard enough, on a clear day, 
  all the way west is the town of {bo,Y}Midgaard{C,BO}.
  To the south, far below, is {bo,G}Sherwood Forest{C,BO}.
  Off to the east is an amazing {bo,C}waterfall{C,BO}.
  Down below it is a {bo,C}stream{C,BO} which leads east
  into unexplored regions. You must relax,
  for it is an almost impossible trip down
  this mountain. Better save up your strength.

  Hmmm, you have a bad feeling about
  standing here. These rocks seem awfully
  slippery. From here you can't see the
  bottom due to the face of the mountain
  and the {bo,C}waterfall{BLA,BO}. I would move if I 
  were you.

Damnit!! You should have gone the other way fool.  As you slip off
the rock you become a bird soaring through the air, or so it seems.
You must be over 1000 feet.  Your life begins to flash before your
eyes as you plunge to your rocky death.  Enjoy this trip, it will 
be your last.

  Hmmm, why do you get the feeling that 
  you are being watched. The eyes in the
  forest grow larger and become multiply.
  You better find a way out of here. This 
  place is not for the weak of heart.

  The forest is very crowded and overgrown 
  with brush and weeds. It seems that 
  everywhere you turn is a dead end. The
  brush here is very dense and hard to 
  travel through. There are many briars that
  are sharp as razors. You should have brought
  lots of armor!

  The weeds are getting thicker as you
  progress through this part of the forest.
  Your body is being sliced open by the briars.
  Poison which the plants contain is beginning
  to make you feel faint, and your body is
  aching.

  You are now in the thick of it. Your

  Much laughter and cheering is going on here.
  Robin's men don't even recognize your presence.
  In the corner, seated on a log, are Friar Tuck

  You have found the hut of Robin Hood. He, as
  always, is in a good mood. Yet, you seemed to
  have appeared at the wrong time.  He is with
  his lovely lady, Maid Marian, and he wishes
  NOT be disturbed.  ou should have come later,
  but you were eager.  Now you must face Robin
  and his men!

  Inside the hut are many treasue chests. All
  are locked and can not be picked. Only Robin
  holds the key to this fortune. Along the walls
  are swords of various shapes and sizes, many 
  bows, and arrow pouches. Barrels filled with
  beer are scattered about. This seems to be 
  some sort of storage area for Robin and his
  band of merry men.
