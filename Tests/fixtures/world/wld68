{CY}   This place is really strange, on the walls hang large labeled

Whenever you close your eyes, you feel like you start to spin and the numbers
one and zero form in your head.

{CY}   There is a large box in the center of this room and on the box there is a
sign that reads:
 {Y}   Spinning complacently in the darkness, covered and blinded by a blanket of
FALSE security has lulled the madness of this world into a slumber. WAKE UP!!
An eye is upon you, staring staright down and keenly through, seeing all that
you are and everything you can never be. Yes, an eye is upon you, an eye ready
to blink. So face forward, with arms wide open and mind reeling. You future has
arrived... ARE YOU READY TO GO?{b,Y}
