  You are in a medium sized efficiency apartment.  The bathroom is the
only other room.... A longer than wide room holds a loveseat sized
sofa, a bed, television, boombox, VCR and a collection of JapAnime
tapes and cartoons.  A spacious kitchen area is at the end of the
room on the same wall as the bathroom.  A wooden table holds a high
speed workstation with a 21" color monitor and a comfortable office
chair waits in front of it.  A high quality print of VanGogh's 
'Sunflowers' (the yellow) hangs on the wall.
