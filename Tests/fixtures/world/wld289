A path leading north to south~

 An old overgrown trail leads north. From the looks of the grass, no one has
traveled this path for years.

Edge of the Glades~

 You have come to the edge of some thick glades. The whole place seems to be
almost too alive. I hope you brought a good machete, because no one has 
cut a path through this mess in a long, long time.

 WOW! This place is amazing. Everything is teeming with life. The plants
even seem to have a mind of their own. You can smell life in the air,
taste it on your tongue, and feel it pulsing beneath your feet. There
is definately something extraordinary about this place.

Deep in the Glades~
 
 As you press deeper into the glades, the foliage is becoming thicker and 
thicker. With almost no sunlight, it's getting hard to tell north from south
and east from west. I hope you brought your compass with you, the alligators 
would love a snack.

Deep in the Glades~
 
 As you press deeper into the glades, the foliage is becoming thicker and 
thicker. With almost no sunlight, it's getting hard to tell north from south
and east from west. I hope you brought your compass with you, the alligators 
would love a snack.

A stone platform~

 You are standing on a large stone platform above the Temple Ruins.
There are many people scurrying down below but you cannot quite make
out what they are doing. A group of young warriors do not seem to be very
happy with you getting this close to their chief. Perhaps you should 
find a quick exit and get out of here before you find trouble.

The Glades~
 
 WOW! This place is amazing. Everything is teeming with life. The plants 
even seem to have a mind of there of their own. You can smell life in the 
air, taste it on your tongue, and feel it pulsing beneath your feet. There
is definitely something extraordinary about this place.
