HELP~
"Mayday! Mayday! This is the UAC Mining colony on Phobos. We need help!"
"Ahhh! things coming through the Gate."
That was the end of the recording.
"Well looks like we are going to Mar, alittle sooner then planed."
"Your still coming with us, but remember you are still under arrest."
"Everyone abourd! We are heading out." Yelled Boyd
"You will stay in the detention cell untill we get there."

Cell~
This is a dull boring room that has no windows or anything.
You can hear the guard coming down the corridor to get you.
"Come on everyone we have a long trip ahead of us."
This is the standard UAC transport ship. Used for long range missions.
"Hey, someone get them into their cell."

Cell~
This is another dull boring room with one little window. It's the kind of
room that you can sit in all day and count your brain cells dying, one by
one. As you look out the window to see Phobos, you wonder what it was coming
through the gate. You also wonder if punching Goford was worth it.
"Prepare to land" comes crackling over the speaker.

A back corridor~
You sneak past a cupple of zombies into a small corridor that looks 
well guarded.  You hope that you can avoid detection, as it will make
 things go faster. You can see a cupple of imps guarding a room to the
 south and wonder why?

You can see now why the imps were guarding this room with care.
As you look around you see a blue key on a crate and wonder what it
is used for.

In front of a dubble door.~
You are now standing infront of two massive doors that look like 
they can't be opened. You can see that they are a little cracked and
you might be able to get through if you hold your breath.  You can 
hear more sounds coming from the other side and wonder if this is 
the way out or just another blood bath.
