Robot Hell~

  You have just entered into the domain of the robot devil.
  Be prepared to give up your life and soul to it and whatever
  else you have. You can hear the robot devil calling out your
  name as you descend farther into it's domain. You can feel
  the heat through the walls and your feet are burning up 
  with each step you take. Each time the robot devil calls
  out a name you hear screams then silence. It almost sounds
  like torture screams then death. It sends a chill down your
  spine as you continue.

  People would rather take the transparent elevated pneumatic

  in the streets don't have wheels instead they are just

  As you race across the moon surface, you can hear the

  step on the pedal and speed away from the farmer as he
  is riding in the Crushinator. The farmer almost has you 
  just as your lunar rover leaps over... what looks like a 
  moat with space crocodiles in it. Your lunar rover lands
  on the other side but the Crushinator refuses to jump
  over the moat. You cheer and that the farmer isn't 
  following you but then a wheel on you lunar rover falls
  off and your stuck.

  As you emerge from the military base you see what looks
  like some kind of fortress. It looks like it has either a 
  electric fence or it could be a force field but that was 
  just rumors. There's this big mechanical robot or something
  standing in front of the doorway. It looks like a battle 
  mech and it looks like it fully armed to the teeth. You 
  slowly approach it but before you could even say anything, 
  it opens fire on you. You look around for some cover, but
  there's nothing around you to use for cover. You better
  start fighting back or your dead meat.

Desert's of Chapek 9~

  As you run out of Chapek 9 all you can see is a dry desert 
  field. Your mouth is parched from the lack of water. Each 
  time you take a step, dirt kicks up from under your feet. 
  Every direction that you look at, all you can see are 
  deserts everywhere. There are a few rocks and bushes 
  nearby. As you gaze out in the distance you can see some
  mountains. You see the ship's cargo lift in the distance.

  Farnworth said about dark matter. For each pound of dark 
  matter it weights 10000 pounds. So Bender has to drag that
  small round dark matter across the floor to the engine room.

  can hear voices but you can hardly see anyone here. The 
  closer you get to the voices you can start to make out
  who's in the room. There's a bunch of robots jacking off 
  a hooker. DAMN!!! You gotta get into the action. There's 
  only one hooker here, we gotta get more hookers.

Sparky's Den~

  Slowly walking into Sparky's Den, you see a bar towards
  your left and tables and chairs on your right. The robots
  in here are drinking and smoking. Empty bottles of Olde
  Fortran litter the floor. Just as your about to leave you 
  notice some movement behind a curtain on the east wall.

Down Escalator~

  This time when you step on the escalator, you can look
  down without having to worry about falling. As you look
  down you can see other people going down to another 
  floor. Hmm you can see what other people have bought,
  there's a purse, a dress, some perfume and a can of Mom's
  Oil. Hey, you can look down people's dresses and shirts.

Outside Sparky's Den~

  Walking down the steps you see a neon sign above the
  door, Sparky's Den. There are empty bottles of Olde

Luna Park Arcade~

  After dropping off the crate at the loading dock, you
  decide to stop by the arcade. WOW, lots of ancient
  video games here. There's "Space Invaders", "Top Gun",
  "Star Wars", "Area 51." Oh look, there's one of those
  machine's where you use a crane to grab the stuffed
  animals and other items.

Mess Hall~

  This is where everyone eats at. There are a couple 
  bottles of Olde Fortran, a bag of bachelor chow and 
  a couple empty bottles. In the corner you see a beer 
  dispenser labeled Olde Fortran just above the infra red 
  slot. So this is where Bender gets his supply of beer.

King's Balcony~

  As you look over the railing, you can see the people of
  Trisal. You can feel the heat coming from the two suns.
  The people are throwing things at you when they heard
  that the previous king was still alive. The angry mob is 
  trying to break down the doors. Since the king is still 
  alive in Fry's stomach you attempt to beat up Fry to 
  make him cry the king out. Everyone join in. Eventually 
  the king will come out of Fry's stomach.

Palace Corridor~

  You walk down the red carpet looking around for anyone.
  All you see are paintings of former kings of Trisal. They
  all seem to have been assassinated. There are even empty 
  frames for future kings and frames for their assassins. 
  You can see the king's throne at the end of the carpet.

Palace Doors~

  You approach the palace doors. There are two very large
  wooden doors here. There's no one here, not even a
  guard. You push open the doors to the palace, you don't 
  see anyone in here.

N.N.Y.P.D.~

  Slowly you enter the police station, but not making any
  sudden moves that could alarm the police of your presence.
  As you look around the station, you notice a police bench
  against the wall where they hold criminals for processing.

N.N.Y.P.D.~

  You look around the station; you see the jail just south
  of you. You slowly make your way to the jail cell. You see 
  something in the cell that catches your eye. Hmm there
  seems to be some sort of force field here. You don't see 
  any keyholes or slots or any kind of controls that could 
  turn off the force field.

N.N.Y.P.D. Jail~

  There are no bars in this jail, wonder how they keep the 
  prisoners from escaping. You walk towards the entrance 
  and there seems to be a force field blocking your way.
  You get a big shock from it when you walked into it.
  Looking around the cell, you see scrawled on the wall
  "Kilroy was here." Hmm, you wonder who that was. Pacing
  around the cell your foot hits a loose metal plate in 
  the floor. You examine it closer.

Tunnel~

  Tunneling your way out of jail you continue digging not
  knowing which way is up or down. If only there was some
  light that could lead you out of jail. It's so dark here 
  you can't even see your hand in front of your face. You 
  continue to dig while bumping your head in the tunnel.

Emergency Exit~

  That old lady is MAD!! She's EVIL!! She'll do anything to 
  keep the production of robot oil running at any cost. You 
  better find your way back into the city before she sends her 
  sons after you. Who knows what evil things they can do
  to you. Looking east you see an emergency exit, hope this 
  leads towards a transparent elevated pneumatic tube.
