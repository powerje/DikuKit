In Front of the Hotel Heart O'the City~

  In the middle of the dangerous drug-district, a closed
  down ruin of a once-a-hotel (Heart O'the City)  raises
  its old and run down facade to a street full of police
  cars and uniformed officers. They look busy as a swarm
  of bees with a bear's paw in their honeycomb.

The Front Desk of the Heart O'the City Hotel~

  Now you are committed.  You move into the hotel, where
  a pack of fully armed and tough cops look at you mena-
  cingly.  The shortest one is no  less than  6'6".  Are
  you really sure you want to mess with these guys?

The Ground Level of the Stairs~

  Ruin all around you, walls covered with graffitis wri-
  tten in a suspiciously familiar and stinking stuff su-
  rround you.  Not to mention the cops,  all  intent  on 
  what's going on upstairs.

The Roof of the Hotel~

  Once again you are out into the smoggy air of the city
  up here on top of the hotel, it's cracked surface sli-
  ppery from years of pidgeons  depositing  their  gooey 
  exhaust.  Watch your steps.  A dozen  footprints  lead
  you east.

Further down the Roof of the Hotel~

  Up here you can see the irregular profile of the city, 
  under your feet the cracked surface of the  roof  top,
  slippery from years of pidgeons depositing their gooey 
  exhaust.  Watch your steps.  A dozen  footprints  lead
  you east.

The Edge of the Roof~

  Oooooops!!! You almost ran off the edge down to a plu-
  mmetting sure death five floors below on the sidewalk.
  Good thing it's not as slippery  here.  What  are  all
  these cops up here geeking at?  Oh, there's  something
  going on on the roof of the next building...ACROSS the
  wide avenue far down!  You think you can jump it?

In Room 203~

  You stand in an empty dark room.  Well, not quite em-
  pty as a matter of fact, it's littered  with  stained
  mattresses, old wrinkled newspapers, and tons of need
  les. On the corner, a cake of  dried  poop  completes 
  the scene.  On the far back, you see the broken glass  
  of the window.

On the Fire Escape~

  A rusty metal frame stairways lead both up and  down
  from this point.  A dove is perched on the handrail.
  You hear shooting above and can see the patrol  cars
  randomply parked down in the street.

On the Fire Escape~

  A rusty metal frame stairways lead both up and  down
  from this point.  The noise scares the doves pecking
  on the platform.  You  can hear the noise too. Some-
  one is shooting right the other side of this window.
