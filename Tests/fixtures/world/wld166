     The walls of this small alcove are all adorned

     surrounded by a different snake-like squiggle

  This room is dimly lit by small ceramic jars on the walls
  at short intervals. The room has been flooded to the point 
  of the water being about four feet deep.

     At the southern end of the room is a great and ghastly

     at you with great intensity. Apparently it is willing to 
     die to protect its treasure. It rears up showing its immense 
     size, then rushes forward to defend its wealth to the death.

{MAG}Into {CY}The {Y}Caverns{y}~

     This cavern is dimly lit by flickering flames rising from 
     shallow stone bowls, resting in carved niches along the 
     sandstone walls. A sharp, musty odor like an overripe cheese
     assails your nostrils.

     Upon entering this chamber you notice something out of the
     ordinary...the appearance of royalty. You also notice that
     the owner of this well-kept chamber has noticed you. He looks
     at you with an evil smirk and stares in your direction while
     drawing his sword.

{BLACK,BO}The Black Dragon's Lair{black,bo}~

     This passage is lit by a single flickering bowl lamp.  The
     walls are decorated with crude murals depicting lizard men
     in various activities:  harvesting slime and algae,
     tunneling caves, raiding other lizard caves, hunting a
     variety of swamp creatures, and so forth.  Most striking
     are the repeated scenes of a huge black dragon devouring
     bound lizard men, giant otters and humans.  You notice
     that in several murals the large dragon is accompanied by
     two smaller dragons.

     This Chamber is absolutely dark, but you sense a large
     open space.  You hear a loud, rattling hissing like a giant
     snoring from the west side of the room...
