Oof!  Your breath is knocked from your body as you hit the ground
*HARD*  Miraculously nothing seems to be broken as you pick yourself

Kary's Bedroom~

    As you enter this room you feel a warm sensation pass through your body.
You're not sure what it is, but your mind is filled with images of peace,
tranquility, and romance.  A large bed with white, lacey pillows dominates
one side of the room.....wouldn't it be nice to lie down and rest for a while
without having to worry about the troubles of the outside world?  Directly
across from the bed there is a fireplace set into the wall.  The embers from
the last fire are still red, and a little heat radiates from them.  Above
the fireplace on a mantle, two candles sit burning.  The soft glow they give
off serves to illuminate the entire room.  Off in the far corner you can see
and ordinate vase filled with more wildflowers than you every knew existed.
Their scent fills the room, and brings images of beautiful hills, valleys,
and streams to your mind.  This is the most perfect room you could ever
imagine.

Mirage's Paradise~

As you walk into this room you feel like you have been transported
to another world.  The beauty of this place awes you, and you are left
speechless by the sights that unfold before your eyes.

A sparkling waterfall dominates the back of this room, filling your
ears with the merry tinkling of thousands of water drops.  At the base of
the waterfall there is a small, clear pool.  It is not very deep, only
coming up to your waist at the deepest point, directly below the waterfall.
Small waterlilies float in the pool, you can smell their sweet fragrance
as it sneaks into your nose.  All around the pool tiny animals are gathered.
A small chipmunk scurries about, searching for tiny berries.  A spring
warbler sings it's joyous song, and fills your heart with hope.

You wish that you could spend an eternity here, breathing in the
beauty of this little world.....
