   Finally..you seemed to have reached the end of the path.
   You glance around to notice strange Runic Symbols etched
   upon six enormous pillars, that seem to reach beyond the
   heavens. Behind an obscure bush centered in the middle of
   the pillars, you discover a dark hole descending beneath
   the earth, ...the smell of blood is intense coming from
   within it. As you walk towards the hole, a {R}red{r} glow...
   begins to form around each of the pillars.

  The path stops suddenly and and eery red glow replaces

  them now. You might even go on to beleive that the God
  of Anarchy is the hardest creature to ever take form in

  You have reached the cloud path. Things seem so peaceful.
  The sun shines over head down upon the world of fluffy clouds.
  The wind blows gently on your back, drying the sweat of your
  daily toils. You feel total peace and harmony now, but you
  know that even the most perfect of places are tainted with
  some imperfection.

  The clouds beneath your feet are replaced by solid ground as you

  out the sounds of the hideous gnashing of teeth.  Something is terribly

  Things aren't as peaceful as you envision them once being.  An evil

  though but back from where you came.  The voice comes into your head, 
  not clearly your thoughts or something else... Have Faith.

          which glow brighter as your eyes gaze further on it. As
          you step closer towards the altar, you think to yourself
          and wonder if this was such a good idea to come here in the
          first place. Reaching out, you run your fingers across the runes.
          If only you could make out and understand what they meant. Only
          then could you complete your quest and fulfill your DESTINY.

{Y}A Murky Hole in the Earth{y}~
{g}
  You squeeze through this tight opening leading up to a 
  light that nearly draws you to it. Faint sounds of insane
  laughter echo in the distance. Mid and grime accumulate
  underneath your worn fingernails. Wouldn't worry too much
  about a manicure right now.

{R}An eerie opening{r}~
{g}
  Finally, you've reached the top. You can barely fit your head
  through the hole you made it to. A few minutes seemed like
  an eternity down there. You give out a sigh of relief then
  turn your attention to your friends that are starting to
  join you on this journey. Peering around the outside of this
  hole, you notice that the trees tend to bellow the calls
  of evil. The soil seems to soak all life that touches it.
