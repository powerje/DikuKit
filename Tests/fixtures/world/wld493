  The houses that line each side of Aquamarine
  Lane have all been painted in colors that
  would remind one of the ocean. Blues and 
  Greens seem to be the most favored of these
  colors. To the north is Stan's Boat Shop
  where one can buy a watercraft and enjoy
  the ocean.

  Closer to the pier the houses on Aquamarine
  Lane are starting to look like they belong
  to the avid fishermen of Eudelta. Fishing
  rods and nets have found their homes right
  outside the doors of every house, awaiting
  the dawn which will bring a new fishing day.

  The end of Aquamarine Lane is a completely
  bare piece of land. Bright green grass covers
  a good ten acres or so. The people of 
  Aquamarine Lane came together when their 
  street was first built and decided to dedicate
  the last few lots or so to store the boats that
  belong to the citizens of Eudelta.

  Through the curtain in the Pawn Shop

  tin and steel structure houses many of

  the warehouse inventory was dumped here
  by newer citizens desperate for cash and
  willing to do almost anything to get it.
  Here, it sits waiting to be sold or, even,
  reclaimed.  Everything is tagged and put
  in its own special spot. Looks more like
  organized chaos...

  the story like a museum of days gone by and

  one might find that the Pawn Shop Clerk isn't
  always a fair man as many items are marked 
  to sell at values much higher than he bought

  has a double bed stretched from wall to

{CY}Entrance to the Warriors' Guild{cy}~

   The entrance to the Warriors' Guild is
   guarded by a skilled fighter. Muscles
   cover his huge body and are extremely
   intimidating. He stands before a golden
   archway which leads into the guild.

  Rumour has it that this heap of a shop
  has been here as long as the dust on the 
  floor. The old glass cases full of used
  jewelry and the shelves of old books look
  as if no one ever shops here. The piles of 
  mildewed clothing and stuffed animals 
  yellow on the floor in the corner of the 
  room.

   This room is painted in a light brown which
   is very similar to the soil on the ground.
   The walls are completely bare save a few
   runes that have been painted in red, blue,
   and green which symbolize {R}fire{Y},{BLU} water{Y}, and
   the {GR}earth{Y}. An old wizard stands in the center
   of the room offering advice to his students
   and training them in the ways of the mage.

  After sinking through the ground every
  wizard finds himself in this gigantic
  room. There is a ten-foot tall blue and
  yellow door placed on the western wall
  leading to the Mage Guildmaster's office.

{M}The Mage's Guild{m}~

  Past the magical barrier a small tunnel leads to
  the back of the establishment. Here, at the end 
  of the tunnel, a small circle with black runes 
  scribbled around it is surrounded by mages. One 
  at a time, they each stand in the center of the 
  circle, close their eyes, and chant some words 
  that are unrecognizable. After finishing their
  chant they sink down into the ground and 
  disappear. Neat!

{MAG}Entrance to the Mages' Guild{mag}~

  The air sizzles with magic, and a glowing
  ball of light races by.  An archway leading
  south into the guild glows lightly, most
  likely enchanted with numerous spells of
  warding and protection.  Only those who
  practice the ancient art of spell casting are
  allowed into these hallowed halls, all other
  adventurers are turned away coldly.

{W}The Ivory Temple{w}~
{WH,BO}
  The Ivory Temple, a place of complete
  tranquility, was designed to honour 
  all who have ever fought with dignity
  and truth. The tall spires reflect the
  glory of natural light both day and 
  night while the inside is padded with
  white satin. There are no windows in 
  this exquisite temple. Instead, the 
  ivory has been shaved to a translucent
  layer allowing light to gleam through.

  Upon passing through the beaded doorway, one 
  finds themselves going up a rather dark stairway.
  At the top, there is a small, dark room. A bubbling
  sound permeates the air as does a horrible odor.
  Wonder if it is coming from the small caldron in
  the middle of this laboratory?

  Entering this small dimly lit shop, there are
  shelves of books and a glass counter where 
  Sabrina stands looking on as if she knows all
