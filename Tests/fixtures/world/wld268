Forest Path~


  The sky is filled with grey clouds, moved by biting winds 
  that give no mercy. Tress line both sides of the path, and
  the evening light drowns them with an evil look. Snow 
  covers the ground, as well as the branches of the trees. 
  This is a lonely place, as if it was a realm of outcasts.
  You no longer wish to stay...

Cemetary of the Past~


  You are glad to have the path behind you. What you see 
  now though could be considered little better. Grave 
  markers stick up chaotically, snow covered as well,
  with faded names and lives marking them. It is becoming
  darker now and you wish to find shelter. The winds bite
  will increase drastically with nightfall, and you dont 
  wish to feel it. To the north you can barely make out 
  the outline of a dark mansion. No lights come from it,
  but you have no choices left, go to the mansion or die
  in the cold.

The rusted gates~


  You know this isnt the place to stay, it looks as if 
  the mansion was ransacked by an angry mob! The windows
  are all broken, and the front door is missing. Scorch
  marks climb up the sides of the outside walls and 
  frozen ivy clings desperately where it can. The cursed
  snow has invaded this area too, you can see where the
  wind has carried it into the desolate house. You feel as
  if you could stand this better if the dang rusted gate
  would quit screeching in the wind. Its now or never you
  decide, if you dont go forward to this abandoned dwelling...
  dont expect to live the night.

Living Room~


  Finally out of the wind, you sigh as heat returns to
  your frigid skin. No light remains of the day and the
  overcast sky wont allow the snow to glow with moonlight.
  As your eyes peer intensely for danger you see nothing,
  nothing but the dust of ages. Although you feel better,
  you will need yet more protection from the night, for wind
  still blows unceasingly through the open windows. And 
  along with it comes your hated friend, snow. Building
  courage you look both east and north, those are your
  exits...choose your fate.

Dining Room~


  Now you know from where the scorch marks originated. 
  This room was devastated by a fire at sometime in the
  past, and much of the floor and walls are in advanced
  stages of disrepair. The cold has intensified yet again,
  caused by the many inches of snow entering through the
  ruined walls at all times. Lumps push up through the 
  white blanket acting as a floor, but you sure as hell
  aren't going to check them out! Fear almost forces you 
  to run even now, looking would just be plain foolish.
  A semblance of a door remains to the east, and if you
  wanted you could probably move enough debris to get
  through it.

Dirty Kitchen~


  Wiping your hands on the wall, a grimace touches 
  your lips. A frozen corpse had been among the 
  debris, and after much debate you decided to move
  it so that you could enter. Looking around now shows
  little different from the other rooms, except there 
  are no windows here. Grinning happily, you give a rude
  sign to the snow falling outside, and then spit to add 
  some emphasis. Peering a little closer now, you notice 
  a stone cooking pit in a corner, surrounded by some 
  long unused pots. What you find odd is that no rats are
  to be seen, they would normally come to a place like 
  this in droves to escape the horrible weather. Shrugging 
  in annoyance, you notice no exits except that from which 
  you came. This room is actally protected enough to stay 
  the night in, but now you are curious...

Bloodied Den~


  Tattered purple curtains hang over long destroyed 
  windows, swaying almost like ghosts as the wind whips
  them about. Old bookcases line most of the walls, but
  of course they are devoid of all books, with only
  cobwebs filling their cavernous shelves now. A 
  stairwell climbs the north wall to an upper level, 
  and it looks rather intact when compared to the rest
  of the house. Stepping further into the room you 
  notice a shield lying on the floor, surrounded by the
  skeletons of many unknown...things. Blood has soaked 
  the floor red you notice, as you brush away the dust
  with your boot. Now you understand why this room makes
  you feel uneasy, there is a sense of violence about it...

This shield looks ancient, rusted almost to paper thin, you still 
notice a spidery scrawl upon it. Its seems similar to elven script, and
you notice a few words such as honor, truth, and justice around its edges.
You dont even consider taking it, for whoever wore this before thee, lost
his life defending something, whatever it was though...

  The instant you step into this dark closet, you know 
  you've made a mistake. A splash erupts with every 
  footstep and you quickly look down. The floor is
  saturated with blood! It seems to seep from the 
  walls...you back-peddle quickly and grab for the door,
  but its not there! Hands, swollen and rotted suddenly
  pull you down into the blood! What is going on, you
  cant think...ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Your last thoughts are
  only, 
            "Why is this happening?"

Surpising Tunnel~


  You shake the blackness from your eyes and look 
  upwards. What just happened, how long have you been
  unconcious? Sitting up you see that you are in a
  rudely dug out tunnel. Walls surround you on all sides,
  except to the south and it is intensely dark that way.
  In fact, you are shivering again. Cursing loudly, you
  stand up and hug yourself for warmth.

  broke as well, so the wind is chillier than ever. 
  You see exits both east and west, passing quickly
  over this nondescript room. There is just nothing 
  here, the wind blows through with a tunnel effect,
  taking all dust and snow with it. No furniture 
  either, so you just move on.

Master Bedroom~


  SNEEZE! The dust seems to be collecting here 
  excessively, and there are actually torches burning
  fitfully in wall sconces. From its dim light you see
  paintings of men and women lining all the walls, and
  a large bed with its head facing the east wall. As you
  peer a little closer you see that two people actually
  lay upon the ragged sheets of the matress, and that
  they are covered in rich clothes and jewelry! You've
  hit the jackpot, now you can flaunt money like all the
  other avatars...whoo hoo! Reaching for the diamond 
  around one corpses neck reveals a mistake though, a
  rasping moan escapes this dead mans lips, and he quickly 
  grabs your wrist with his parchment dry hand...
            
             "Oh crap," you say out loud.

 There's a foul taste of poisoned blood in your

 those hands were, they didn't kill you and that's
 reason enough to tolerate the taste. The soil 
 here is crumbling fast, and this crude tunnel is
 held up by nothing more than rotted wood. You'd 
 better get out fast, so you decide to continue 
 along with all possible haste.

 to be lost for ages. A small fountain sits here 
 and a single torch is jammed into the wall.
 Peering closely reveals some scratches in the

 clouds within its confines. To each side of the

 unmoving and hard to see from what little light
 is in the room. Suddenly their dead eyes begin
 glowing and they raise to their full height, 
 time to fight...they know you are here now.

 Looking around forces a gasp of surprise, the

 seems that you stand within a vast desert, 
 endless in all directions and filled with
 promises of death at every turn. Peering skywards
 forces a shiver of fear as well, the sky is 
 neither grey, blue or white, but a dark bloody
 color, as if stained with the sins of the corrupt.
 No plant life is in sight, and the only clue of
 inhabitation is the tower looming far to the north.

 tweeking you as to what has caused its sickening

 from dried blood leads endlessly to both sides.
 No door bars your way but fear fills the air,
 and dread crawls in your mind. Something is
 wrong, but what?! Stepping towards the gateway
 proves your senses right. Four Shodite Guardians
 rise from the blasted land, standing unmovingly
 in your way.

 with a world unknown from what you've seen so far.
 A race of man frolics within these drawings, a
 carefree yet responsible smile on all their faces.
 The only way up seems to be a dried out vine crawling
 up the towers side. Peering at the floor reveals a
 silver plaque, tarnished with age.

plaque~
To the lords above, we tried. With our lives we paid and with the death of
innocents. Yet the worlds corruptness fought us back, smashing the dreams
of Shodas. The lands bleed and all life dies but for those of the sinned.
I place this here with my life, as I shall die in my chamber...mourning our
loss.

Chamber of Serenor~


 Jumping from the vine you land on the next level.
 Dust and sand fill the corners and the wind 
 whistles through holes in the crumbling walls. No
 pictures are here and the floor sags in the middle,
 as if ready to collapse so you stay to the edges. 
 A desk sits nearby and is the only remarkable
 feature you can find. Walking towards it you see a
 thin parchment on the floor and pick it up.

parchment~
This piece of paper seems untouched by age, yet its lettering is faded, even
missing in places. It reads...

Shodas lies dead, and they come. Our rebellion is gone, even now Arath defends
the few of us who remain. He will be the last, for he was always the strongest
and then it will all end. The cause has failed, and the world shall die with
it n...

Suddenly the message stops and an old stain covers the rest, a stain of dried
blood.

View of Wenrill~


 Finally you reach the next landing, it seems 
 to take hours to climb the vine. Here the walls
 are virtually nill, with only wooden beams and 
 stone fragments holding up the topmost parts of 
 the tower. There seems to of been a battle of
 titanic proportions here for the floors and 
 pieces of walls are scorched black. Blood, 
 somehow still fresh lies in pools all across the
 floor. A metal shield lies near the floors center.
 Around its edges is written the words 
        

          "Immuris Seluna Der Hunre."

 What it means you know not, but looking on the 
 inside of the shield you find common words reading,
       
        

          "For the love of Shodas."

Chamber of Shodas~


 The vine stops here so you step onto the final
 landing, the last room. All the walls are covered
 by plush, pine green curtains. They are faded with
 age yet still lend the room a singular quality.
 The ceiling is nonexistant, for it seems to of been
 literally ripped off judging from the ragged edges
 you see far above. No blood is here, and a deep 
 sorrow stills your heart as you walk towards the
 chambers center. The place is desolate and empty, 
 but for a statue near one wall. The statue is of a
 man, a man who weeps as some sort of monster wraps
 itself around his entire body. His hands are forced
 towards you, pleading for your help it seems, but
 alas...you came to late. At the statues base lies a
 sword, and as you walk towards it a shadow disconnects
 from the curtains, racing for you!

Sildara~


 The Lord of the Past is dead, you have taken
 his last breath. Where you stand now seems to
 be a virtual paradise. The sky is blue, the
 fields are green with summertime grass, and a 
 fresh breeze drifts by. White puffy clouds fill
 the sky and the sounds of animals, frolicing in
 their joyous lives fills the air. Where can this
 be, it contrasts sharply with the tower and the
 land on which it sat. Looking northwards you 
 gasp...can it be? The tower stands only a short
 walk to the north, and it appears to be in 
 excellent shape.

Path of Stones~


 Chills force you to kneel to the ground, a
 dizziness fills your mind. This place, you
 have been here before. Only there were skulls
 instead of stones. What is going on? The tower
 is close now, stunning in the morning sunlight.
 There seems to be no one here, as if no pain, 
 no evil, had ever found its way to this place.
 Standing up quickly, you step lightly...prepared
 for any surprises.

The Living Gate.~


 You remember this gate from before, only
 it was cracked wood blackened with blood.
 Now it almost seems to be alive, as if one
 great tree makes up the entire structure.
 The tower is breath taking, so different
 from how it was in that other realm...or
 time. No guards stand here now, so you open 
 the gate lightly and walk up to the towers
 base.

Base of the Tower~


 Yes, it is the same door, with the same mural
 of a man with his arms raised to the sky. This
 time you look up and the calm vanishes. A dragon,
 all black with deep green stripes flys in and
 slams into the towers side! You cover your ears
 as it screeches in defiance. Suddenly a large
 blast of energy bursts from somewhere within the
 tower, slamming into the great beast and crippling
 it. Circling a bit, it suddenly plummets to the
 ground and you fall as the ground rumbles with a
 crash. The dragon is most certainly dead, but you
 see the battles only begun. In the sky a black
 mass moves towards the tower, and it shall arrive
 soon.

Side of the Tower~


 The attacking dragon has drawn your curiosity,
 so you head for its landing place rather than 
 the tower. A sight of horror greets all who look
 here. The dragon lives, yet bleeds horribly as 
 its acid-like blood seems to boil and steam in 
 the cool air. Its wings are broken and worthless
 now, both blackened from the magical attack and
 crushed from the long fall. Taking a single step
 forward you make a mistake by bringing your scent
 closer. The dragon throws its head back and 
 screeches madly, then drops down to eye level with
 you. There is only one thought in those eyes,
 sweet death...

Castle of Taem Lost~


 After defeating the dragon a weariness settles
 on your mind. What is this all for you ask. To
 see both present and past of events unkown, why?
 Then yet another portal leading to here. To sit 
 and rest...and remember. Life is full of mystery,
 chaos, and you have grappled with both to reach
 this point. Now it has led to here, this ancient
 castle of an immense and unknown size. With its
 towers forever shadowed by storm swept skys and a
 lonely wind crying to your ears. This place seems
 to be an ideal, a thought out of time almost...

Arc of Silence~


 Stepping under an arc of an odd shape, you
 recognize it as the entrance to the castle.
 It seems to be made of a translucent green
 and black stone, and oddly...no sound can be
 heard when standing under it. The castle 
 stands closer now, dwarfing most you have seen
 before. This could be the home of a god, for
 though it is unremarkable with its plain grey
 stone, there is a feeling of power in it...or
 even...acceptance?

Foreyard~


 A rippling curtain of shadows covers the doorway
 before thee. It rises several  hundred of feet
 into the air, with a width of almost one hundred
 feet as well. It seems the only entrance, must 
 you walk through it? To each side of this faint
 path the field continues, another possible choice.
 You feel so small from the size of the door, and
 that inspires terror and fear. This place is truly
 huge, what must it contain you ask. Oddly you have
 met no one as of yet.

Snowy Field~


 Walking west brings you to a plain field. Snow 
 covers all the ground and the wind continues to
 moan from the dark sky. To the north is the
 castles wall, with its towers tops disappering 
 into the clouds. There is just simply nothing
 here.

Gallows~


 The snow is bloodied here, as if it can never be
 covered up. A long dead tree stands forlornly, as
 if it weeps for what it must do. On each of the
 ancient branches a rope is tied, all holding the
 corpse of a long dead person. Things crawl within 
 their remains, maggots and worms, and you almost
 wretch. This place seems to want you to leave, and
 you oblige willingly.

 Walking into the east field shows little of

 grey wall, while further east is yet another
 field and fence. You kneel for a second to 
 catch your breath, marveling at how your breath 
 steams in the cool air. Grumbling about the
 eternal cold you get up and continue.

 Here to the east, near the castles corner, 
 you can see far onto the horizon. This snowy
 place seems to be endless, with a quiet danger
 making you tense. The clouds slowly form shapes,
 morphing from men to weapons to death and then
 back to men. A little to the north you see some
 stables, empty but for a faint trace of maneur.
 This place is empty as well, no reason to stay
 here.

Reception~


 Walking quickly through the "door" forces you
 to clench your jaw. The shadows are cold, almost
 seeming to whisper to you, "You invade...you
 die...you dont belong..." It is repeated in a 
 maddening tone, yet quickly fades so that a sigh
 of relief issues from you. Looking up reveals 
 where you have come. Rooms are east, west, and 
 north. The shadows will not allow you to go back
 though. The floor is nothing more than dirt, 
 while the walls are merely speckled granite.
 Torches sit along the walls while huge chandeliers
 of candles hang from the ceiling. Something has
 changed, you now feel a presence...

 Walking into these halls only heightens your

Sinister Eclipse of Existance~


 This second level is made of a translucent 
 glass-like stone. No torches light here, yet
 the surfaces give off their own muted glow. 
 Within the walls figures seem to form then 
 fade quickly, swirling in a chaotic fashion.
 Faint screams can be heard intermingled with 
 the cries of fear, pain, and even love. This 
 place speaks of error, of mistakes and the
 terror caused by such. Looking about reveals 
 no differences, the walls and floor all look 
 identical. The screams seem to torture one's 
 mind, tearing hopes away and erasing the past.
 Then you sense something, feel it unwraveling 
 like an old blanket...the fabric of existance
 is in flux, life itself is being created even
 as it is torn away.

Sinister Eclipse of Existance~


 This second level is made of a translucent 
 glass-like stone. No torches light here, yet
 the surfaces give off their own muted glow. 
 Within the walls figures seem to form then 
 fade quickly, swirling in a chaotic fashion.
 Faint screams can be heard intermingled with 
 the cries of fear, pain, and even love. This 
 place speaks of error, of mistakes and the
 terror caused by such. Looking about reveals 
 no differences, the walls and floor all look 
 identical. The screams seem to torture one's 
 mind, tearing hopes away and erasing the past.
 Then you sense something, feel it unwraveling 
 like an old blanket...the fabric of existance
 is in flux, life itself is being created even
 as it is torn away.

Southwest Tower~


 This tower is largely empty but for a few dusty
 chairs. No windows allow light so that only the 
 glow from below brightens the interior. Here the
 stone appears as normal and it relaxes you a bit,
 even as you clutch your weapon tighter. This place
 is not for mortals, it seems as if a god has made
 a mistake and was destroyed by his own power.
 Shuddering insinctively you crouch low as something
 moves within the room.

Ladder Tunnel~


 Climbing the ladder was simple enough and it has
 brought you to a small chamber made of the same
 clear stone. Figures continue to dance within the
 walls, forcing a grimace of distaste as they speak
 of death and horror. Grabbing the next rung you 
 pull yourself up, not wishing to listen longer.

Northwest Tower~


 The top of this chamber is shattered, with no 
 ceiling evident so that a clear view of the 
 dangerous sky is presented. At your feet the 
 stone is tainted red and pitted from some force.
 Debris litters the floor as well while 
 tapestries hang from the cracked walls. Peering
 closely at these faded ornaments reveals a scene
 of ill favor. This castle is seen, with some being
 atop its walls, a white glow about his frame. In 
 the tapestry beasts flock to this being as he seems
 to manipulate their existance, if such can be said.
 The scene ends here as the tapestry has faded to
 dust.

Southeast Tower~


 Pulling yourself into this room is quite hard,
 as debris literally squeezes the entrance to 
 half your body size. Once in you stoop and 
 catch your breath, a faint chill evident. The 
 ceiling is intact and no windows are seen, yet
 this place is covered with mirrors, ceiling,
 wall and floor. Though the floor is cracked and
 shattered, the others reflect your image 
 millions of times, streaking it with black from
 the floor. This sight is plainly disturbing and
 you quickly retreat from the room, though not 
 soon enough...

Ladder Passageway~


 Clear stone slowly diffuses into a normal granite
 texture, plain and smooth without images or sound. 
 Sighing with releif you stop and rest against the
 ladder. Fatigue seems to tug your soul as you look 
 down. So tired you say to yourself. The meaning of
 all this is confusing, and it seems to twist 
 reality itself. Why and how, those are the answers
 you seek, yet where shall you trek to do so. Can 
 you trust in luck...

Northeast Tower~


 Your body seems to literally slide into this room,
 as you feel the fabric of your existance sucked 
 into the interior. Laying upon the floor you gasp
 in pain and fright. "What is happening?!" Your mind
 screams these words. Skeletons surround you, long 
 decayed and petrifyed. A single touch crumbles them
 so that they sift into the floor's cracks. Getting 
 to your knees forces tears into your eyes. Windows 
 look in all directions, showing much of the bleak
 landscape and allowing a cool wind to grace the area.
 Pulling forth a weapon you stand and clear your mind.
 Trapped? Cursing the tower you peer to the ceiling
 and spy the well hidden trapdoor. Escape!
 Fearing the worse you make no sudden moves and 
 contemplate. This place, what has it been all for...so
 many clues unfinished. Safety is close, but are the
 answers near as well...

Dark Lights~


 Easily you crawl into this dark hallway. 
 Strange light illuminates the area which 
 casts a muted glow to all objects. There
 is no evident source and you shiver in 
 response. This room is actually of a 
 temperate condition, finally out of the
 infernal cold. To the north is a door, 
 beyond it the sounds of a well used
 Market Square? But to the east, west, 
 and south are shimmering portals, each 
 reflecting a milky image. Hard to the 
 touch they are not to be entered, yet a
 sense of finality is within them. Doors 
 to other worlds?

 Sighing, you walk forward and prepare to 
 return to the square. The sights you have
 seen, battles fought...they had purpose, 
 they were not in vain!
 

 But why?

Tavern of Choices~


 This is an old drinking hole for weary adventurers 
 and tired explorers. The ale is good and the food 
 is fine, plus theres always entertainment. All the
 tables are filled and the constant buzz of talking 
 fills your ears. Sighing, you lean back and sip 
 your drink. This short respite is nice, yet you know
 that soon you must leave. But first you plan on 
 getting a little info on this mansion you've heard
 about, the "{BO,G}Land of Eternal Choices{bo,g}" is what the 
 sages call it. Bah, a land for conquest is your 
 name. Peering up you notice a presence before you,
 a god?! It leaves a sheet of paper on your table,
 you had better read it...

Hello friend...this message come to you from the past. I know your thoughts,
you wish to learn this place, conquer it like all the others. But I give
warning. Traps plague this land, ones i rightly call "Death Traps." So
I urge caution on your part. And I would not travel alone, take with you allies
ones you can trust, for your life may well depend on such. And your
prowress must be great, that of a High dual level in the least. If you go
forth without heeding these words, may the gods have mercy on your soul. Alas,
I can say no more, even now the thread of existance I wove untangles, for
I fell victim to the final trap...

Summer Pasture~


 Tall grasses cover gently rolling hills while
 an afternoon sun peeks from behind ocassional
 clouds. The air is so clean its almost sweet 
 to the senses and a comforting breezed drifts 
 by. Trees stand in various spots, all fully
 into summer bloom with a thick bounty of green
 leaves covering thier limbs. The land soothes
 the troubled soul and you almost lose yourself
 in the serenity found here...

 Large trees tower far overhead, their lowest limbs 
 feet above you. Leaves of an entrancingly beautiful
 shape cover them in entirity, creating a scene of
 pristince calm when paired with the deep blue sky.
 A thick grass covers the ground, while bright white
 flowers dot the area. Between the trees and flowers
 a sparkling stream meanders, with fish and animals
 taking of its gift.

 seen. Around its banks a small tree grows, all
 covered in leaves ablaze with the orange of 
 autumn though summer is here. Kneeling you 
 splash your face and feel instantly refreshed,
 with worries and dirt both washed away.

Oceans Watch~


 Following the slow moving streams brings you
 along a high bank. Here the breeze carries a
 salty tang of the ocean and various birds 
 swoop down in the distance. Indeed, the water
 goes on endlessly to the east. An odd sight is
 seen far away though...it appears that boats 
 are sailing this way. The first sign of 
 intelligent life in this new land, and is it a
 good sign at that...

 A very clean room, neatly done with a plush 
 fur carpet. Exotic is almost the word you 
 would use, with furniture all of a green 
 tinted wood while slate windows let in a 
 multi-colored light. A vibrant green vine
 leads up to a second level, it is definately
 alive as it pulses rhythmically with an inner
 life. The desk here is covered with some dry
 parchments scrawled in some unknown language. 
 Tall halberds are hitched constantly upon the
 walls, seeming more decorative than useful.
 Hmm, who lives here? That quesion is quickly 
 answered as a figure fades into view.

The Touch of Oblivion~
This is a quiet place, so peaceful and serene that you could just fall
asleep and not wake up....ever. Cold water soothes a troubled mind, while
the pains of battle fade. Noises disappear and sunlight bathes you
occassionally as clouds break apart far, far above. It could all
end now and you'd be happy...

Chamber of Serenor~
This room seems ancient with dark stone walls encircling the area. A faded
tapestry runs the entire length, showing a battle from start to finish.
Some sort of humanoid is winning the battle only to be crushed by a
swarm of...trees in the end? No, it couldn't be but your eyes do not lie.
Indeed, at the tapestry's finish trees cover the humanoids and pull them
below the soil. Forcing your eyes away you get a better look at the room.
A single desk with two candles and a chair are the only furnishings
besides the tapestry. There appears to be windows of some sort, but they
are blocked in with leaves. Odd is the only word that comes to mind.

View of Wenrill~


 Climbing the vine to this landing tells you much,
 such as you are far from fit. Besides this fact
 you step back at what you see. A beautiful lady 
 is kneeling here breathing heavily, while most
 of the west wall is simply gone leaving a 
 wonderous view of the blue sky. She holds a shield
 in a death-grip but does not look up at your 
 approach. This person must have fought the dragon?!
 And won apparently for it rests far below. Taking
 a furtive glance around depicts a lush setting, walls
 covered in curtains of midnight blue, a small bed 
 with sheets marked profusely by lavender flowers,
 and strangely...a stone desk and chair. What should
 you do? This women hasn't noticed you yet...you 
 think, but she could anytime now...

Chamber of Shodas~


The vine finally ends here and you are glad for such. This high up the
air almost seems to be thinner, harder to breathe. But now something new
grabs hold...a terrifying of.. what? You can't quite place it...but...yes.
An unending sadness, so deep a and horrific that it blinds the mind. A tear
is almost shed before a comrade shakes you back into reality. Now you see 
where you are, a room shrouded entirely in shadows, the only are, a room 
shrouded entirely in shadows, the only light coming from a rotating crystal 
at the ceilings peak. The walls are all black, with a green writing scrawled
across them in patterns that forms pictures within themselves. Then you notice
the bed, a small broken cot looking strangely uncomfortable and a broken man
sitting on the edge of it. He seems to be conjuring an entity from beyond..
There is a faint glow coming from under the sheets..

The ground is completely frozen and mimics the dark grey found overhead

creaking sounds seem to fill the area. Trees are also found here but alas
these are solid ice, victims of the deadly weather. Leaves as clear as
mountain water are still attached, as beautiful as those found blazing
in the autumn warmth.

The trees slowly thin and lead into tall grass, stiff yet still swaying
in the biting winds. Like everything else the grasses are frozen and
almost clear, with only a tinge of green-blue to denote they had ever
truly lived. The road continues up a small rise which will quickly
flatten if you proceed, yet to the left is a small cave. But perhaps
your choice has already been made...

very sinister in its appearance. No windows are seen, only curtains on
the walls in all directions. These must yet cover more portals to
various planes of existance.

Standing high atop a mountian, with a swift wind blowing the falling snow

brush covers this small ledge, and black spots mar its surface. This is
where Tremson tests his creations. The dark grey sky pushes down oppressively
and you peer around, seeing a sign...      *------------------*

these appear to be the spawn of the creature you killed outside. Ridding
