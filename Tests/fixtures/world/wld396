   You are now walking down a stretch of asphalt road
   that is nearly deserted of vehicular traffic.  This

   The Key.  An entity of unspeakable power, a group of monks
   formed it into human form, and gave it to the Slayer for 
   protection.  Dawn Summers, the younger sister of Buffy, is
   The Key, and Glory and her followers will bleed her in order
   to usher in the Apocalypse.  She must be protected!
