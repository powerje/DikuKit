{RED}Bend in the Path{red}.~

   {YE}You have entered upon a narrow, empty, dark path.  There are tall trees
   surrounding you and when you raise your head and look up you cannot see
   the sky.  The path continues east, but it seems to be more narrow and
   darker than you had first thought.{ye}

{RED}Approaching the Castle{red}.~

   {BL}As you continue along the path you can now see where it leads.  In
   the near distance you can see an enormous black castle.  The castle
   is built of solid black slate rock reinforced with heavy mortar.
   Perched high on the tower lofts are intricately carved gargoyles riding
   high along the sides.  It seems to be rather quiet from here and you
   cannot see much activity near the perimeter wall.  With such a huge
   structure towering right before you its hard to believe that it is so
   well hidden along this path.{bl}

{RED}Outside the Castle{red}.~

  {BL}You finally arrive at the end of the path to find yourself standing outside
  the gates of the huge castle you had seen from the path leading up to this
  point.  Something in your distant memory seems to recall a legend about
  an ominous black castle hidden in the woods were no mortal could reach
  it and only evil creatures of the night dwell.  Well, here you are standing
  outside the castle, and the gates do not seem to be locked or guarded.
  There is no sign of any hideous creatures, so maybe this is not the
  legendary castle.{bl}

{RED}Castle Entrance{red}.~

   {CY}As you enter the castle gates, you find the first sign of residency
   in the form of a guard who stands on duty here.  The entrance of the
   castle seems somewhat inviting and far less intimidating on the inside
   as it does from the outside.  Up ahead, you can hear some sounds of
   people talking and laughing, and it doesn't seem like this guard is 
   going to give you any resistance if you try and go further into the
   castle.

   You see a {BLI,RE}SIGN{bli,CY} on the eastern wall. Might be a good idea to look at it.{cy}

{RED}The Main Chamber{red}.~

   {CY,BO}This is the large foyer on the main floor of the castle.  There are 
   rooms in every direction from here.  You can hear guests and residents
   of the castle laughing and talking amongst themselves from all around 
   you.  It seems almost as if they are whispering in your ear.{cy,bo}

{BLU}The Velvet Suite{blu}~

  {BLU}What a voluptuous scene, this masquerade. The rooms in which it is held.
  There are seven --an imperial suite. In many palaces, however, such suites
  form a long and straight vista, while the folding doors slide back nearly
  to the walls on either hand, so that the view of the whole extent is
  scarcely impeded. The apartments are so irregularly disposed that the
  vision embraced but little more than one at a time. There is a sharp turn
  at every twenty or thirty yards, and at each turn a novel effect. To the 
  right and left, in the middle of each wall, a tall and narrow Gothic
  window looks out upon a closed corridor which pursues the windings of the
  suite. These windows are of stained glass whose color varies in accordance
  with the prevailing hue of the decorations of the chamber into which it 
  opens. This room seems to sedate you with its melancholy velvet hues.{blu}

The Black Velvet Suite~

   {BL}This suite is closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries that hang all over
   the ceiling and down the walls, falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the 
   same material and hue. But in this chamber only, the color of the windows
   fail to correspond with the decorations. The panes here are scarlet --a 
   deep {RE}blood {BL}color.  But in the corridors that followed the suite, there stood,
   opposite to each window, a heavy tripod, bearing a brazier of fire that
   projects its rays through the tinted glass and so glaringly illuminates the
   room. And thus a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances are produced.
   But in this chamber the effect of the fire-light that streams upon the dark
   hangings through the blood-tinted panes, is ghastly in the extreme, and
   produces so wild a look upon the countenances of those who enter, that there
   are few of the company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all.{bl}

{RED}A {BLACK}Dark{black} {RED}Hallway{red}.~

   {BL}You are standing under a huge archway off the main hallway that leads
   further down this darkened corridor.  The lighting here is very poor as 
   compared to the previous rooms of the castle.  There are no torches to 
   line the walls, and the only light is that which spills over from the 
   main hallway.  It seems that this hallway probably leads to the parts
   of the castle where the guests were not intended to roam about.{bl}

   {BL}The lighting here is very poor as compared to the previous rooms of the
   castle.  There are no torches to line the walls, and the only light
   is that which spills over from the main hallway.  It seems that this
   hallway probably leads to the parts of the castle where the guests
   are not supposed to roam about.{bl}

   {BL}As you reach the end of this hallway you find that it turns heading

   even the light that was spilling over from the hallway doesn't reach
   this far down the corridor.  You notice a {YE,BO}s{BL}h{YE}i{BL}m{YE,BO}m{BL}e{YE}r{BL} of light{bo,BL} north of

{RE}One {BLACK}Way {RE}Out{re}.~

   {BL}A small room of 10' by 10' walls.  A lone pedestal stands erect and
   motionless in the corner of the room.  On the pedestal stands a bust
   of a handsome man with deep piercing {BO,GR}e{bo,BL}y{BO,GR}e{bo,BL}s.  In the corner of the room
   is a pile of rat bones.  A horrible stench emanates from the blood
   stained pile.  A large rat makes its way around the east wall of the
   room.  A shadow creeps from the darkness and clutches the rat from 
   the floor with one fell swoop.  It pulls the varment into the darkness
   all you can hear is a barely audible sucking sound.  At that moment
   the creature is tossed onto the pile of bones into the corner, the 
   stillness of the room allows you to hear the last beats of it heart.{bl}

  There are seven --an imperial suite. In many palaces, however, such suites
  form a long and straight vista, while the folding doors slide back nearly

  vision embraced but little more than one at a time. There is a sharp turn
  at every twenty or thirty yards, and at each turn a novel effect. To the 
  right and left, in the middle of each wall, a tall and narrow Gothic 
  window looks out upon a closed corridor which pursues the windings of the
  suite. These windows are of stained glass whose color varies in accordance

{BL}   A large shelf stacked with bottles of liquor from floor to ceiling.
   Oddly enough, the bottles don't appear to be filled with liquor,
   they seem to be filled with some dark murky {BO,RE}red{bo,BL} liquid. Down near
   the bottom shelf you notice some scratch marks around a small metal
   hole. Could this be a hidden entrance to some place?{bo}
