Kevin's Watch~


You find yourself on a granite slab-like platform that appears
to hang suspended in the air. An expanse of sky as huge as if
you were perched on a mountaintop covers you. The wierd halo
of the sun gives a disturbing hue to the rolling gray sea of 
clouds two hundred feet below you. The clouds thrash like 
thunderheads concealing the earth from horizon to horizon.

Kevin's Watch~


The mountains rising dramatically here seem to strike you a 
blow. They spring upwards out of the clouds a stone's throw
from the Watch. Their peaks are rugged and dour. From the 
cliff behind the Watch, the mountains withdraw on both sides
like a wedge, piling higher into the distance.  Off to the
distant northeast, like a giant granite spur, stands Mount
Thunder.

Kevin's Watch~


You are still on the mountain lookout known as Kevin's Watch.
As legend suggests, it is here, upon this spire, that Kevin
Landwaster fought his last battle with the evil Lord Foul. The 
air here is thin and does little to ease the tension you feel 
surrounding you. The stone beneath your feet is cold and damp,
but appears to be magically wrought.

hypnotic power, sucking at your concentration. Gray gloom thickens
toward midnight at every step of your descent. Long plunges yawn 
all around you.

You are below the cloud level now. Abruptly the sun fades and 
goes out. A pale flash runs through the dank sea of clouds followed
almost at once by thunder. The wind mounts, and rushes wetly at you 
as if it seeks to lift you from this spire. The mountains around 
you disappear into the abyss of clouds above. A bolt of lightning
thrashes past you, illuminating the mad boil and speed of the
clouds. The sky shatters.

The Land~


You have entered the Land known so well by Thomas Covenant,
Unbeliever and White Gold Wielder. To the east snakes a dusty 
trail to Mithil Stonedown, and the vastness of the Central
Plains spills out before you to the north. On the northern 
horizon you see the Westron Mountain range, home of the 
giant-wrought Keep of Revelstone. Towering behind you are the 
Southron Mountains and the spire of Kevin's Watch. You see no
way to return.

striding eastward, then, two leagues away on your left, drop sheer 
to the upland plateau, still a thousand feet more above the 
foothills. The plateau narrowed to form a wedged promontory
half a league in length and into this promontory the ancient 
Giants have delved the immense and intricate habitation of

soil and rock, a place lain wrecked and riven for so long that it has

Lord Foul's Creche. Two matched towers, as tall and slender as minarets,
rising several hundred feet into the air, and between them at ground level
is the dark open hole of a single entrance. The dark windows of the twin
towers gape blindly back at you like soulless eyes, hollow and abhorred.
The mouth of Foul's Creche is smooth and symmetrical, unadorned, perfectly
made. The opening stands in a massive abutment of wrought stone---a polished
fortification which cups the entrance as if it leads to a sacred crypt.

The walls and floor are smooth and polished, as if years of labor had
wrought them to a glasslike finish. A smallish window opens to a view
of the land, now dark and gloomy, trampled underfoot by the malignance
of the Creche.

The Great Stairwell~


A broad spiral of a stairway, its open center like a great well, curving
gradually back into the promontory as it descends. The stair itself is
large enough to carry fifteen to twenty people abreast. Its downward spiral
draws your gaze, entrancing you until you feel overcome by vertigo and a
fear of falling.

Cavern Within the Creche~


Everywhere the stone stretches and meets without seams, cracks, junctures;
the cavern is smoothly carved, polished, and unblemished by ornament,
feature, or error. It is obviously not giant-wrought as it lacks the 
giantish enthusiasm for detail. Its perfection seem to surpass any
kind of mortal craft.

The Maze of the Creche~


A cold green light radiates all around you, and the air, as sharp as ice
crystals rattles in your chest. The exists all appear identical to one
another, and your sense of time and direction feel distorted by the contempt
and malice that lurks in the shadows.

The Demondim Spawning Pits~


The sudden drafts in this room reek of rotten flesh as the buried air seems
to flow over centuries of accumulated filth and vast hordes of unencrypted
dead. The putrescence here is so thick you can see it in the air. Central to
the room is a wide pit of bubbling mud and ooze.

Large Gallery of the Creche~


A large uninhabited gallery. Massive enough that an orator could have
stormed at an audience of thousands, or sermonized a troop of the most
fearsome banes. An evil-looking altar rests at the southern portion of
the gallery.

altar~
An oddly shaped stone altar, tinged green with hate and malice, occupies the
southern portion of the gallery. Despite its odd shape, its uncompromisingly
flawless features define the evil passion that created it.

Demesne of Lord Foul~


The mist here glows with the light of burning stones, but as it swirls,
the red fades into the dank, universal gray of fogs. A wash of heat and
stink of brimstone pour over you. The vile reek melts into a sweeter
smell---attar, the odor of funerals. Fear and bewilderment suck at you
as if you were sinking into a nightmare.
