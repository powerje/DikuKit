In Front of the Hotel Heart O'the City~

  In the middle of the dangerous drug-district, a closed
  down ruin of a once-a-hotel (Heart O'the City)  raises
  its old and run down facade to a street full of police
  cars and uniformed officers. They look busy as a swarm
  of bees with a bear's paw in their honeycomb.

  Now you are committed.  You move into the hotel, where
  a pack of fully armed and tough cops look at you mena-
  cingly.  The shortest one is no  less than  6'6".  Are
  you really sure you want to mess with these guys?

The Roof of the Hotel~

  Once again you are out into the smoggy air of the city
  up here on top of the hotel, it's cracked surface sli-

  exhaust.  Watch your steps.  A dozen  footprints  lead
  you east.

Nebuchednezzar's Lower Deck~

  You come down the ladder and find a typical ship deck.
  All bolts and metalic sheets.  Marks on the  wall  are  
  the only visible sign of the violence  that just  took
  place here.

In the Maze of the Oracle~

  This is the same city you used to "live" before Morphe

  Hey! That small restaurant over there ... they used to
  make very good noodles!  Oh, well, it was not real.

With the Oracle~

  Now you feel at ease.  The oracle stands in  front  of 
  you.  Not quite what you expected, eh?  She looks  old
  enough to be your mother, but not much more. She warns
  you..."Don't mind the vase!", and awaits for your code
  phrase.  What is the guideline to ultimate knowledge?

any other person in the same room. Everybody wins out of a free airing
of ideas, complaints, difference of opinions. This is OUR mud: your mud
and mine! Each one of us makes the MUD, each one of us is important to
our mud!{bo,c}.

{BO,C}It's a privilege to enter this room, not a punishment. This is the
free assembly where all voices carry the same weight, from a newbie level

La Cueva del Zorro~

This is the famous cave of El Zorro, his hideaway.  Hanging
from the ceiling you see some Serrano-ham-legs,  along with
garlic strings, and some hot pimentos.  Stacked by the wall 
there are some red-wine (tintorro) barrels.  From the  back 
of the cave some music can be heard,  you  distinguish  the 
sound of guitars, and some voices singing gaily in Spanish.
