{BO,GR}The Land Of Calandra{bo,gr}~
{Y}
   The lands of Esdragon, and Calandra were about to be
 joined in peace. For, the Princess Allaire from Esdragon
 was to marry the King of Calandra. But through an act of
 deception the dreaded Ice-lord Nimir had caused an abrupt
 end to the wedding. He then captured the princess and put
 her into an enchanted sleep. She was then exiled into the
 dreaded Darkenkeep, while the war between the lands of
 Calandra, to the north, and Esdragon, to the south began
 to escalate.
   Years later, after the fighting among the people has
 weakened the lands defenses. Nimir has begun to move south
 from the icy wastelands of Darkenkeep, and soon he and his
 minions will have an icy grip on all of Calandra.

  The master magician Blais is dead, defeated by The Winter

 which might have defeated Nimir and restored the lands of
 Calandra back to the beauty which it once possessed. His

{BO,GR}The Cottage{bo,gr}~
{Y}
   Tristan, who had been out gathering magic stones and
 objects had no idea that his master had been slain. When
 he returned home, he found the small cottage where he and
 the old mage had lived empty and somewhat disturbing. He
 searched throughout the cottage and stables and could not
 find any trace of the master. Eventually, he gave up the
 hunt and returned to the cottage.
   Once back to the cottage, Tristan heard a voice softly
 calling out to him. Through a small brass dog, the master
 began explaining to him what had happened.
   Blais had used the last of his power to set his young,
 but noble apprentice out on a quest. Success would break
 Nimir's hold on Calandra... Failure would be death.
   Carefully hiding the spell needed to begin the journey
 amongst the many volumes of spellbooks which were strewn
 about the cottage. Tristan needed only to search for one
 word.

   The first thing needed to undertake Tristan's mission
 is Valadan, the great war-horse of Esdragon.
   Said to be sired by the swift west wind, so the legend
 ran, on a bay mare belonging to some long dead Duke of
 Esdragon. The mare had been the Duke's favorite, though
 she was too wild to be ridden, Nor would she have any part
 of any earthly stallion. She outran them all, until some
 great wizard whose very name was now lost, charmed down
 the wild wind to be her mate. She lived only a few days
 after what had been an understandably difficult foaling,
 but the colt himself  had thrived and soon became an even
 greater favorite of the Duke's, and all the Dukes that had
 followed. He, being bred by magic, had never grown old.
 His wisdom, it was said, was beyond that of many humans.
 He had served nobly till the last Duke lay dying at his
 side. After that he had disappeared, supposedly captured
 by Nimir.

   The spell to begin your search brings you to a broken trail
 behind a traveling carnival. Strange, but for some reason now
 it seems obvious. What better place could one find to hide a
 horse than in a carnival?
   The road looks long and rough, many wagons have left their
 impressions upon the terrain. The weather has apparently been
 very dry lately. Dust clouds fill the air, making it hard to
 see very far ahead of you.

 the wheel under their feet and to something in the shadowy

   The snow had been dry and stinging. But now it has turned
 wet, and clings to face and clothes. Its weight has increased
 rapidly. You have to surge forward with tremendous effort now.
    In a flash, ice needles begin flaying your face to the bone.
 The pain from their relentless, tearing, and piercing is the

  Strange, but the wind and snow seems to have ceased. The air is

 only wind-battered stone remains, with little ripples of snow
 wind-spread across it.
    And the path! It spreads from your feet straight as a flung
 dagger, wide as a doorway, to the Gates.. and beyond, Darkenkeep.
 It seems to call to you.

    Its shape is that of a great fanged mouth, rimmed with teeth
 of ice. At the sides, the ice forms mighty columns, thick as a 
 man, higher than trees. Icicles hang down from the roof also,
 dripping watery venom down onto the pitted snow. A gust of wind
 whistles by, sounding like mocking laughter, and there comes a
 tinkling from inside, as if part of the vast roof just fell in.

  Few details are visible, but the place seems to be warren

 issue from them, and sometimes ghastly smells. The caverns
 are huge and spacious, every sound made is amplified down the
 numerous and ever widening hallways.

 like a fly inside amber, is a man. He is clad in silver armor
 chased with moon crescents, stars and rainbows. There is a

 is high-boned and noble. His brows level and strong. His beard
 is spun of finest gold. He holds an opal-hilted sword before him
 in the first guard position, warding off some unseen terror.
 Most notable is the look of absolute fear forever frozen on the
 strangers face.

 to bruise oneself against effortlessly but are too smooth to 
 offer any type of handholds. You find yourself constantly lying

{BO,BLU} Opening to an Underground Cavern {bo,blu}~
{BO,C}
   After receiving many new bumps and bruises, and using an 
 equally new profanity for each one received, you finally seem 
 to be regaining your footing. The ground has finally begun to
 level out a bit. A more solid ice has begun to build up under
 your feet. Appears as if some ancient underground stream has
 frozen in the full course of its flow.
   It looks as though the tunnel is widening out ahead of you.

{BO,BLU}The Base of An Icy Cliff{bo,blu}~
{C}
  Upon entering the cavern, you see the source of the frozen 
 stream. Where a stream had once burst from an opening in a
 glacial wall, a great waterfall of solid ice now glistens.
 White ice, shading away to near transparency, glows blue and
 cream in spots. It rises to what seems an impossible height,
 up into the shadows. The whole thing seems to glow dimly.
 You can see what appears to be a hole through the waterfall,
 near the top, between an icy overhang and the jagged ceiling.
   Between you and the hole.. a hundred foot sheer cliff of
 slippery, jagged ice. The cliff also hides many other dangers
 and obstacles. As if the cliff isn't enough of an obstacle!

   Upon entering the hole the path begins to once again run
 downward. As you advance onward, the air has grown dark.
 It is impossible to see any distance in front of you, and 
 you begin stumbling into walls that remain unseen until the
 last painful moment.
   The magical path on the ground is still clear enough, so 
 you can only conclude that there is something in the air
 itself which clouds the sight and makes the place seem so
 dark. By paying the closest attention to the ground you find
 you are able to proceed. You just proceed slowly...
