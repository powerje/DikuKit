  The last of the city lights is here. Everything 
  south of this point belongs to no one. Many enjoy
  the marshes which lie south of Eudelta. Many unusual 
  animals call the marsh home. The mayor has posted a 
  {BLU}sign{W} here at the city border.

  Tall blades of grass cover the valley floor.
  The view to the north of the road is blocked
  by distant mountain peaks while the view to 
  the south stretches for miles and miles in a 
  vista of marshlands and exotic fowl. The flat
  road ahead seems to be never-ending.

  A gentle breeze blows through the valley picking 
  up the scent of wildflowers and spreading it out
  over the world. A large gray bird soars through 
  the sky just overhead. The noise of the city has 
  changed to a calm whistle of wind, squawks of birds,
  and the crunch of dry grasses under foot.

  Along the sides of the riverbed there are small
  water spiders gliding along on the glimmering blue
  surface. They dance aimlessly, weaving in and out 
  of one another and protruding objects that may get 
  in their way. The loud croaking and clicking of the
  wildlife gives the sense of what lurks about. The
  edges of the river are soggy and collapse when 
  anything attempts to wander onto it.

  Bright as the fresh summer's morn, the sun topples
  onto the trees and water. The aroma of the fresh
  water and surroundings give the sense of relaxation.
  Off in the distance the sound of water trickling and
  rushing is overwhelming as much as it is relaxing. 
  The rustling in the background is distracting as the 
  fear of what is lurking about is in question. Off to
  the left and right shadows appear all of a sudden! What 
  could it be?

  A southwesterly breeze flows through the air and
  rustles the leaves and trees that tower above.
  Salmon leap out of the murky depths as though it
  were mating season. On the embankment, there is 
  a mother grizzly bear with her offspring attempting 
  to catch a meal of the fish that meander about. The
  growling of the frustrated grizzlies, echo throughout
  the dense forest as they aren't able to retrieve their
  food successfully. The mother plunges into the river 
  out of desperation and emerges victoriously from the
  relentless rapids with enough food to feed her family
  a wholesome meal.

  As the dusk turns to dawn, the steam mystically
  radiates off of the surface, as though a presence
  is creeping along in pursuit. Every so often there 
  is a head that pops out of the water. This place 
  is filled poisonous snakes, frogs, and even 
  poisonous army ants. There are trees with sharp 
  spikes and thorns that follow the water's edge 
  and plenty of biting insects and disease-carrying 
  mosquitos that call this place home. Beware of the
  Black caiman that can reach 16-20 feet in length.
  They might get a good meal if they are hungry 
  enough.

  Watching from the top deck of the ship, the ability 
  to grasp the scale of the river that stretches for 
  miles is beyond ones imagination. Even though it is 
  the height of the dry season and some 2000 miles 
  from the Hermanthaya Rivers end, the river is still 
  nearly a half-mile across. In the rainy season, the 
  river spills over the banks and floods the adjacent 
  forest. It is a tough time for many of the villagers 
  who live on the river banks because their houses 
  (most of which are built on stilts) are surrounded 
  by water. It takes a dugout canoe just to travel from 
  house to house.

  Off to the left on a rock that lies in the midst 
  of nowhere,  an Anaconda is at rest. When it is 
  hungry, it will uncoil itself and lie still in the 
  water with only its eyes above the surface, waiting 
  for prey. Many stories are told about anacondas 
  attacking fishermen, but it is rare for anacondas 
  to attack humans unless they are being directly 
  assaulted or agitated. It is advised that no one 
  approaches the vile creature.

  Hermanthaya's dynamics change with each

  washes quickly by reshaping the banks almost
  daily. Vegetation varies from jungle to

  The river starts flowing really fast here.  Only
  the most experienced boaters travel down the last

  them takes a lot of skill.  Debris from capsized

  the river picks up speed and hurries to the next

  As the Hermanthaya River gets closer and closer
  to Haishi Lake, the river opens wide, allowing
  fresh water to flow continuously into the lake.
  The current is still relatively strong here,
  but the earlier hazards of navigating the river
  are not present.  The crystal clear waters of
  Haishi Lake lie directly to the south.

  The normally calm waters of Haishi Lake ripple
  in a bit of a current.  The mouth of the River
  Hermanthaya lies directly to the north, always
  bringing in fresh waters into the lake.  Fish
  and birds are especially abundant here, taking
  advantage of the influx of new life the river
  provides.

  Shimmering, the lake dances in the moonlight
  while two lovers take a midnight run across
  its surface. Parking only for a moment to steal
  a kiss, it seems that the world stops and 
  focuses on them. The creatures of the lake gaze
  happily at the two and for a split second they 
  forget that they are crocodiles and turtles and
  fish and birds.

  River Wind Road runs along the bottom of an
  ancient riverbed, which has long since ceased
  to flow.  Small pools of stagnant water are
  everywhere along the road, creating a rather
  foul stench in some places.  The valley high-
  way is to the north, and the road runs east.

{Y,BO}
  Passing through a small room with a kitchen at
  one end and a cot at the other, there are two
  hundred fifty steps up to the beacon. This small
  lighthouse has been in operation for the last 
  ninety-two years. Before the tower was erected,
  the beacon sat at the edge of the rock and the 
  local townspeople took turns lighting the lantern.
  Now, the elected keeper watches the electric 
  lantern and ensures that the bulb burns brightly 
  all night long throughout the year. Looking directly
  at the bulb could be hazardous so, don't!

  through. The steps are cold, the air is dank, and
  the only sounds heard is the crumbling of stone
  with each step.

{B,BO}The Tower Steps{b,bo}~
{BL,BO}
  Wandering up and to the left, the stone steps
  are cold and dirty. Worn away on the edges, the
  steps seem to crumble with each step. Burned out
  torches line the curved wall up to towards the 
  tower. It is very dark, very cold, and very lonely
  here.

{B,BO}Top Floor of the Tower{b,bo}~
{BL,BO}
  With no windows or torches in the stairs
  of the tower, the only light which enters 
  this area is from the mystical red glow to 
  the south which seeps through the crack under
  what must be a door. The walls here are
  smooth and the air musty. The stone steps
  stop on a platform just before the mysterious 
  door.

{R}The Study{r}~
{R,BO}
  This room has a rather high ceiling. Lining the walls
  are shelves of some unknown wood. Examining it further,
  it certainly doesn't come from these parts. The carpeting,
  dusty though it may be, depicts the story of the great
  knights and king that must have inhabited this edifice.
  Golden threads dance in the light. A large, red velvet
  chair sits in the middle of the rug and one behind a huge
  desk made of the same mysterious wood as the shelves. 
  The windows are made from intricately carved stone which 
  must have taken the artisan an incredibly long time to 
  create. An average sized, yet powerful, telescope sits in
  the corner near the window. This must have been a favourite
  room as the cushions are well worn and select books rest 
  open on the desk and chair as if someone intends on finishing
  them.

  This underwater cave below Haishi Lake is
  surprisingly cold, the warm light of the sun
  that normally heats the lake never reaches
  this deep.  Small fish and unknown slithery

  passage, many using it as shelter against
  larger predators.

  of smoke into the air, indicating that the owner
  has been here recently.

  A fireplace at the north end of the room keeps

{CY}Midgaard Subway Station{cy}~
{CY}
  Leaving the hometown behind and venturing off
  into the great unknown, the citizens of Midgaard
  head off to Eudelta. The Midgaard-Eudelta Subway
  Line makes intercity travel more comfortable and 
  promotes the sister cities' relationship of good
  will. The station itself is rather plain but in a
  rustic way. The walls are wooden and the lights 
  resemble torches. The platform before the train
  is also wooden with iron rail spikes holding it
  together.

{Y}The Hermit's Shack{y}~

   This tiny shack is barely standing. It has
   suffered years of abuse from the ocean waves
   and strong windstorms. In the corner of the
   room a man is sitting at a homemade desk 
   furnished of wood and whale bone. Dirty 
   hides of various animals act as a rug for
   the hermit. Although this place is in 
   poor condition. It is the perfect home
   for this man, sheltered from the problems
   of society.
