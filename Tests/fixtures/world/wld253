Delpher's Sanctuary~
  Climbing to the top of the hill, you look over what was once a green 
and fertile valley, full of trees and life.  Unfortunately, all that is
gone now, replaced by the ashes and cinders of a burned forest;  the
only pristene feature remaining is the small river slowly flowing below
you.  The sky itself, once blue and clear, is now choked by the dark
clouds of approaching winter.  The wind blows swiftly by you, carrying
ashes and the smell of smoldering wood.

The Meeting Chamber~

  Lifting the torn fabric that forms the makeshift door to Delpher's new
home out of your way, you enter a small cave formed by the arching roots
of a very large, dead tree.  The smell of cold earth fills your nostrils
and the light casts dancing shadows on already knotted roots, making them
seem to crawl on the walls.  A straw mattress serves as a bed, the only
other object in here, other than the lit lantern sitting in the middle
of the floor.

Entrance to the Archway~
You have entered a barren chamber, with a single obvious exit: a glowing
portal that makes up the entire north wall.  The vortex that appears on
the other side of the portal could lead anywhere...

A very, very odd room.~
You have entered some sort of space/time vortex, which seems to be bending
the laws of reality... You have lost all sense of gravity and depth as
everything seems to be melting and blending in with everything else.  The
only point of light illuminating the area you're in seems to be coming
from somewhere up ahead of you.

City of Herat~
A beggar greets your sudden appearance with a toothy grin and a dirty look.
He scurries down the street and disappears into the masses of the city
bazaar leaving you standing in the dusty avenue among the other startled
patrons.  The portal that brought you here has disappeared as well, 
leaving you without a way home.  Welcome to Herat.

Bazaar of Herat~
You are standing in the marketplace of the desert city of Herat.  People
are all around you, most of which are dressed in unusual clothing that
you don't recognize.  Pack animals lumber along while their masters whip
and scream at them.  All around you, the bazaar moves on about its 
business.

Deeper in the Bazaar~
As you continue to wander in the bazaar, the crowds become thicker, and
the people are less friendly.  The shopkeepers are louder, and the shops
seems more extravagent in this area.  All around you, life is swarming
like flies on a rotting corpse.  People seem to ignore the oppressive
heat, but you're not.

varities of silks.  He has many different styles, colors, and patterns
available... most of which are probably quite expensive.  He grins a toothy

From here, you have to strain to see the top.  You are however, easily able
to make out figures moving through the many windows and openings around
the pyramid's structure.

The gates of the ziggurat are of sturdiest bronze, with huge hinges.  You can

Inside the Gates~
You have passed through the gates into the courtyard of the ziggurat.
The ground that was covered in dust and dirt has given way to
cobblestones, and the air here is noticeably cooled by the numerous pools
and fountains around the area.  Fewer people walk here, and most of
them are templars and priests accompanied by the occasional guardsman.

Another Chamber~
Just like the other rooms, the maze continues here without any hint of
detail.  The blank stone walls seem to watch you, staring at you,
pondering your very presence... as if mocking you some how.  A distant
sound echoes through the vaulted ceilings of the surrounding chambers,
and you think it's time to move on again.

Oasis chamber~
Like some sort of calm in the storm, this room seems to be unaffected
by the mysterious presence affecting the maze.  You can almost feel
the dweomers sparking to life in your equipment once more.  A fading
mural of an oasis adorns the walls around and a starry sky is painted
above you.  With the calm comes a reprieve from the oppressive feelings of
the maze around you.

putting the experience behind you, you turn towards the lit area ahead of
you, and continue onward.

The chamber of the pit.~
You step into the light, and are confronted with the dazzling light
of a huge chamber, the bottom of which is concealed by a pit of green
ooze.  Careful though, there aren't any hand rails to save you from
falling over the side.  The liquid below bubbles and froths, giving off the
strange green glow that illuminates this area.  Vapors rise up from
below, sickening you.

You notice the skeletal remains of a few humanoids scattered around the
bridge and you kick part of an arm off as you pass.

In the pit~
As you hit the surface of the liquid, you feel a terrible burning
sensation and then the calm, cool feeling that accompanies death.  Slowly,
the ooze eats away your armor and clothing, followed by the skin, flesh,
and finally your bones.  All that remains of you is char and small bits
of metal that will slowly dissolve over the centuries.

The next doorway.~

and pause... what if the maze continues beyond this point?  Will you
be stuck forever, wandering aimlessly as your body and mind waste away?
Will anyone ever find you, or will you ever find a way out?

The throne of the labyrinth~
Coming out of the hall, you enter the ruling chamber of the labyrinth
master's kingdom.  Before you is a great throne carved entirely out of
a monstrous dragon's skeleton.  The maw of the beast serves as the seat,
and the wings spread out to flank it.  As a whole, it takes up at least
100 square feet.  Looking closely at the bones, you can almost make out
a visual history of Herat carved into each one, in a manner similar
to scrimshaw.

All sound from the bazaar is gone, and the only thing you hear are your own
footfalls on the ground beneath you.  The eerie silence is overwhelming...
Boxes and litter abound here, though one crate in particular looks somewhat 
different, like it was out of place somehow.

This large crate seems to be filled with stones, to provide weight against
those who would move it and accidently discover the entrance to the guild
below.  A counterweight is activated by a key... but where's the key?
