     Welcome to the ghetto.  You are walking into a
     dark and grimey part of town.  You notice a 
     stench of urine and garbage.  Very different
     than you are used to.

     To your North you see Etude that leads to the
     mall, and the Complex.  To your west, you see
     Lancaster that will lead you to Joey G's for
     some beer and pool.  And to your east, you
     can see lots of pot heads going to the bong
     shop.

     The walls are decorated with hemp wallpaper with

{W} You were never aware that a person could be so filthy.
The Dredd certainly has some cleaning issues, you notice.
The bathroom looks asif it was once white, but the walls 
are stained yellow, and the paint is peeling. Most likely
from the horrible stench the toilet eminates. Though the
smell makes your stomach lurch, you hold it back dredding
that toilet.

     Watch out.  This guy is in the
     mob.  Hes a mean drunk.
     In this small cold room, you
     wonder if he can feel the
     temprature of the room, or if
     he just sweats more cause he
     is terribly overweight.

      If you are here, you prolly weren't
     invited. But people have a rude habit
     of just showing up. Sometimes people
     want to be alone. Men suck. All of them.
     If you have a penis made of flesh, ask 
     lythia if you have to leave. :P
