Wysi's Burrow~

   You find yourself in a warm dark burrow hidden in the Arizona
   desert.  You're surprised to see a computer monitor sitting
   at a large oak desk.  Behind you, you see 2 fancy shelving
   units displaying dozens of Wysi's beloved tarantulas.  You
   are quite surprised to see the array of colors ranging from
   your basic black or brown tarantula to exotic tarantulas
   garbed in black and white, green, red, and even blue!  Nearby,
   you see the beautiful female Arizona blonde that Wysiwyg named
   after herself.

Wysi's Wacky World of Wildlife Entryway~

   You feel an odd sensation as you wander through the desert.
   It's hot, but thankfully in Anozira, it's a dry heat, or so
   they say.  You don't know how you got here.  You think maybe
   it's time to turn back, but your curiosity gets the best of
   you.  You see a SIGN.  Read it or else...

The Edge of the Desert~

   The feeling intensifies as you move deeper into this vast
   desert wasteland.  You feel as if you are being watched by
   many pairs of eyes and you are surprised anyone or anything
   could live in such a desolate place.  You swat at the flies
   buzzing near your face.

Lost in the Monsoon~

   Suddenly, you hear the loud boom of thunder and see a streak
   of lightning plummeting toward the earth nearby.  Dustdevils
   are swirling everywhere, kicking up dust and making it very
   difficult for you to see.  You realize you'd better seek out
   some shelter before the rain hits and makes things even more
   unpleasant than they already are.  You'd better hurry!

At the Base of a Small Mountain~

   You are now standing at the base of a small mountain.  It
   really just looks like a small hill, but in Anozira, even
   hills are considered to be mountains by many of the
   inhabitants who reside here.  You are hoping this might lead
   you to safety as the rain begins to slightly moisten the land,
   making it even more humid and unbearable.  There is only one
   direction you may go from here and that is up, unless you want
   to go back out into the monsoon!

Near the Cave~

   After wandering aimlessly through the incoming storm, you
   find yourself on a desert mountain.  You think you spot an
   entrance to a nearby cave and you head in that direction,
   hoping to find shelter and wait out the approaching storm.
   You hear the crash of thunder and feel that it is too close
   for comfort.  You'd better hurry!

At the Mouth of the Cave~

   Congratulations!  You've almost found your way out of the
   storm.  You are now standing at the mouth of a cave leading to
   the east.  You feel a sense of dread as you continue your
   journey but you are happy to be away from the worst of the
   storm.

Inside the Cave~

   You are now standing just inside the cave, feeling just a
   little more comfortable.  Just when you start to get too
   comfortable, you notice a frenzy of activity as the bats
   begin to fly out for their nightly rendezvous with all the
   local flying bugs.  You duck as several bats fly over you.

A Little Deeper into the Cave~

   You wander a little deeper into the cave and see more bats
   heading out for their evening dinner.  You hear a strange  
   droning sound to the east and wonder, "What could it be?"
   You can either go west to check it out or venture west to see
   what you might find in that direction.

The Top of the Pyramid~

   You find yourself standing at the top of large pyramid out in
   the middle of nowhere.  You look around you and you see the
   land is rather bare.  Sand everywhere!  There are no buildings
   that you can see and you think you see a long line of ants 
   trailing up toward you.  It's awfully dry out here and you
   feel that maybe you should check your water supply before
   continuing through this desolate place.  You think it might be
   a good idea to mark this place and acquire some more water
   containers before venturing on.  You can also re-enter the
   portal to head back to where you came from.

The Ticket Booth~

   Congratulations!  You've managed to find your way to the
   Anozira Botanical Gardens.  You'll see all kinds of unusual
   types of plants and animals thriving here and probably several
   you'd never expect to see.  One of the most popular Anozira
   attractions, the Botanical Gardens is also a great place to
   to People Watch, if you're into that sort of thing.  Don't
   forget to buy your ticket and have fun!

The Entrance to the Botanical Gardens~

   Now that you've purchased your ticket, you'll need to decide
   what you want to do first.  You can follow the signs to the
   snack bar area or you can just follow a trail through all the
   wonderful Anozira plantlife.  Do be careful though as one
   wrong step could lead to disaster for you!  Whatever you do,
   please don't feed the animals or you may live to regret it.

On Your Way~

   Well, it looks like you need to make a choice.  You can move
   east or west.  You have a hard time deciding which way to go
   so you try to see if you can't find some clue as one wrong
   move could be your last move!  You begin to wonder if you
   shouldn't just go back the way you came?

On the Corner~

   You are now standing on a corner of a condominium complex.
   Ahead of you, you look out into the vast parking lot where
   the residents and their guests regularly park.  There is a
   tree standing here and you hear noises coming from within it.

East of the Staircase~

   You find your way into a nice quiet neighborhood.  To your
   left, you see some carefully manicured bushes sitting near the
   sidewalk.  You can't help but notice the lovely green grass
   sprouting up all around you.  To the west, you can see a
   cement staircase.  You can either head toward the staircase or
   head back the way you came.

Stairs to the Condo~

   You're standing at the bottom of some stairs leading up.  You
   look around you and you can't help but notice the cool pattern
   of the shadows hitting the stairs.  Pretty neat!  You look on
   the wall nearby and see a couple geckos peering back at you.
   You can just barely make out the window at the top of the
   stairs from here.  It's so peaceful and quiet, you wonder if
   this neighborhood is deserted?

Entrance to the Condo~

  You've managed to make it up to the top of the stairs.  To
   your right, you see a door leading to someone's condo.  You
   look through the window and don't seem to see anyone moving.
   You knock and nobody answers.  It's so hot outside and you
   just can't stand another minute of it.  You test the doorknob
   and the door opens!  You can either decide to go inside and
   cool off or you can risk being totally dehydrated by the
   intense Anozira summer heat outside.  What will you decide?

Inside the Condo~

   You're now standing inside the condo.  It's hot outside so
   be sure to shut the door behind you so you don't let the
   coolness of the airconditioning out.  You look for a place
   to sit and relax for a few minutes before venturing on.  As
   you move out of the doorway, you can see the balcony view of
   the beautiful pine tree that helps give this place some shade
   from the bright sunlight outside.  Just be sure not to relax
   for too long or the residents are likely to be home and wonder
   what you are doing inside their home without their consent!

In the Flashcat Zone~

   UH-OH!  YOU'VE DONE IT NOW!!  You have wandered into the area
   fondly referred to as The Flash Zone.  This is typically the
   area between where you are and where you want to be.  Staring
   back at you, you see a big fluffy orange Persian cat with
   huge, round, copper eyes.  He blocks your path in his
   desperate attempt to get your attention, hoping youll give him
   the pat on the head he truly desires.  You suddenly realize
   there is NO escape.....or is there??

Entryway to the Master Bedroom~

   You are standing in the doorway of the master bedroon.  It's
   pretty much impossible to see much from here.  You begin to
   wonder if it's really safe to go inside and wonder who you
   might encounter, if anyone.  Do you dare to invade the
   privacy of this person's home?

In the Master Bedroom~

   You've found your way into the master bedroom.  You look
   around you and you see a queen-sized bed off to your right.
   To the left, you see an antique dresser with stuff piled all
   over it.  There are clothes everywhere and you wonder how
   someone could accumulate so much stuff and just leave it
   lying around.  This is probably one of the biggest messes
   you've ever seen!  The dust mites here have grown to gigantic
   proportions here with all the nourishment available here. YUK!

Under the Bed~

   You see all kinds of clutter underneath the bed....clothes,
   papers, cat hair, toilet paper, magazines, old graded homework
   assignments.  You think it's probably impossible to find
   anything here and you're right!  You think you detect some
   movement underneath a pair of crumpled jeans.
