INSIDE OF A PINTO~
You find yourself inside of a Ford Pinto and are simply disgusted
at the lack of quality.  The ripped fabric on the seats is a 
definite indication of it's age.  You start to shudder as you
picture yourself driving one of these.  The speedometer only
registers up to a maximum of 60 km/h and it is obvious
that this car could never have reached that speed on its
best day.  You see that the car has never been cleaned and
you can't seem to think of a reason why it should have been.  It
is definitely one of the ugliest cars you have ever seen.  The
paint is a faded yellow which is perfect for the look that this
beast portrays.  You pray that it won't get hit in the rear-end
and have the gas tank explode while you are in it.

AMC GREMLIN~
{GREEN}You notice yourself in the middle of a car that seems familiar.
Upon further inspection, you realize that you are sitting in the back
seat of an AMC Gremlin.  You recognize it as being the car from 
"Wayne's World" and hear QUEEN blasting "Bohemian Rhapsody" in the
CD player.  You are thankful that the drunk guys aren't in the car
with you and spewing chunks all over.{green}

AMC PACER~
{RED}Y U C K !!!!  You have to wonder what you are doing in this brutally
ugly piece of scrap.  From the inside, you get the feeling that you
are standing in a greenhouse.  There are so many windows that it is
kind of ridiculous, yet most of them are either cracked or they have 
been broken.  It would seem that whoever designed this car must have 
been designing it with the intention that people would store their
plants in here instead of having a garden>{red}

AMC CONCORD~
{YELLOW}This vehicle is better known as the "Killer Concord From Hell".
As you open the door, an alarm starts to go off and you wonder why 
on earth somebody would want to steal this car.  Even more disturbing
is the fact that the owner thinks that it would be a bad thing should
someone decide to steal this car.  Regardless, the alarm continues
to sound until you pull at all of the wires and stop it.{yellow}

AMC SPIRIT~
{CYAN}When you see this car you have to stop and wonder how this company
ever managed to sell any.  Obviously, they must have had some appeal
but you are unable to figure out what it would have been.  Maybe it 
was the fact that the car originally came with an 8-track player
that made it so desirable although, nowadays, an 8-track probably
wouldn't help sell a car.{cyan}

AMC JAVELIN~
{BLUE}This car is the pride of this automobile maker.  It is the only
decent car that they ever made as far as most people are concerned.
It's sporty look is somewhat threatening and it's stance on the road
is a wide one.  The rims have been recently cleaned and the tires are
fairly wide.  The engine appears to be fairly large and more than
likely it's quite powerful as well.{blue}

{GREEN}This car is undoubtedly one of the nicest you have ever seen.  
Under the hood sits a{green} {WHITE}{BLINK}455{white}{blink} cubic inch
engine.  There are very few parts on the engine which haven't been 
chromed.  It's 4-barrel carb. allows this car to generate unbelievable
speeds.  The car roars as it's dual exhaust keeps the entire 
neighbourhood awake.  The convertible top is down and you can see the
4-speed shifter.  You also see a ferocious looking beast sitting in
the drivers seat.  You wonder how it can sit in the drivers seat with
a huge tire around it's waist.

OLDSMOBILE CUTLASS CALAIS~
{RED}This is not an overly impressive vehicle.  It has 4 doors and a
6-cylinder engine.  It isn't built for speed or handling, it is
intended for use by a family.  As a family car, it well serves its
purpose beacuse it has a comfortable looking interior with lots 
of leg room.(good for a giant){red}

OLDSMOBILE OMEGA~
{BLUE}When you see this car, you suddenly understand why it's
production was halted after only a few years.  There is a real
good reason why it is no longer being manufactured.  The structure
of this car is quite ugly and you have to wonder how somebody
could have actually approved this design to be produced and in 
a few unfortunate circumstances, sold.{blue}

so it's obvious that somebody is test driving it.  You can
tell by looking at the car that it is more than likely quite
expensive.  Actually, if you looked closely enough, you would
be able to see that the price is written in the window.  WOW,
this car has quite a few options.{yellow}

{MAGENTA}This is a 1969 Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser.  From the name,
you would never have guessed that this vehicle is a huge station
wagon.  It's got a large engine which is necessary in order to 
move a car that is this big and heavy.  When the back seat folds
down you almost have as much room as a pick-up truck.  The majority
of the roof is made of glass which provides quite a view.{magenta}

before.  The entire car is painted black as white or black

produced.  It is sporty looking and has dual exhaust coming
out from the rear end ground effects.{cyan}

CHEVROLET CHEVETTE~
You see a 'VETTE directly in front of you.  It has a shiny silver
painy job.  It is a 5-speed, 2 door, dark tinted, sunroof, and
it is a hatchback.  It's sleek design is a definite attention
grabber.  There are a few words painted on the engine hood.  The
words read 454 c.i..  You notice that this {BLINK}{RED}CHEVETTE
{blink}{red} is one mean machine.  The driver's seat is practically
where the old back seat used to be.

{BLUE}This is a horrible speciman of a 1977 Chevrolet Monte Carlo.
You have to wonder if this thing could float on water because
it sure is a BOAT.  There are several rust spots and even holes
in the body.  In the areas with no rust there are patches of
BONDO.  You walk up to it, kick it, and a few pounds of BONDO
falls to the pavement.{blue}

the roof which are flashing at the moment.  There is a commotion
around the car which impairs your view but you can still see a
mural on the door that reads "To Serve and To Protect".  There 
is a cage between the front and back seats and the number "911"
is printed on the trunk.{green}

tires on the back and real tiny tires on the front.  The whole car
has been tubbed in order for the wide tires to fit on it.  There 
are no wheel wells left on the car.  The body appears to be mainly
fiberglass so that it can get down the track with ease.{blue}

CHEVROLET CELEBRITY~
This car is a 4-door model (the prototypical late '80's family car).
By now this car has developed quite a lot of rust on it's brown
exterior.  The ehgine has obviously been through quite a bit and it
has a distinct knock as it idles.  The odometer reads 210,000 km's.
There is not much room in the back as there are 2 big baby seats
fastened in.

CHEVROLET MALIBU~
{CYAN}This is a late '70's Chevy Malibu.  It's a 2-door model which
makes it more desirable than the 4-door versions of the same.  It
has an 8-cylinder engine but only a single exhaust pipe sticks out
under the rear bumper strangely enough.  When it idles you don't 
hear anything special coming from the exhaust as it probably has
manifolds instead of hedders.{cyan}

identical to a Pontiac Tempest.  It looks nothing like the Tempest
GTO that existed in the late '60's.  This particular model was 
only made for about 4 years in the late '80's and was a popular
model because of it's size and reasonable price tag.{blue}

CHEVROLET CAVALIER~
{YELLOW}This car has been unbelievably popular since it's inception
in the early '80's.  It is one of the cheapest and yet practical 
vehicles that Chevrolet has ever made.  This particular car is a 2-door
model with Blue paint and 5-Star Mangel rims.  Also it has a
spoiler sitting on the trunk and a huge, expensive looking 
stereo system taking up the trunk and most of the back seat.  You
have got to wonder why on earth anybody would spend so much money
on this car.  It even has cross drilled brakes, high performance 
brakes, shocks, struts and an expensive alarm so that nobody
steals the car (Ya Right, like anyone would wanna steal it).
It also has ground effects that were obviously custom made for
this car.  The numerous dents hint that the driver is not all
that good because the car has been involved in many accidents.{yellow}

BUICK SKYLARK~
This is a black 4-door model, approximately 1992.  It is still in
really good shape with no visible signs of rust and a good paint
job still covers the car.  On the inside you see a cellular phone
mounted on the floor next to the automatic shift console.  The 
odometer shows that the car has been quite likely used as a commuter
car due to the high kilometres.

{GREEN}Before you sits a 1966 4-door version of a Pontiac Strata
Chief.  It is green in color, but that is barely recognizeable
as you pay far more attention to the fact that it is sitting 
up on blocks.  As you look closer, you see that there is no 
longer a radio inside and the interior is in real bad shape.
The car shows its years but it still looks like it could be
made a collector again.{green}

a fairly new car that has a slightly sporty looking body.  It

to you.  It is 2-door and as you walk by, you see that the car
mats are still the factory (newspaper-style) paper over the 
carpets.(red}

V-6 with a 5-speed transmission.  It looks to be a 1993 model
year judging from the lights.{yellow}

engine sitting under the hood.  The hood has a large Firebird
sticker on it and you notice that the trunk also has a similar
sticker but only smaller.  The tires are extremely wide and the
rims are not the factory originals.  Instead they are chromed
and real shiny.  As you peek inside, you see that it has an
impressive looking stereo sitting in the dash.{cyan}

{BLINK}{BLUE}PONTIAC GRAND AM{blue}{blink}~
{WHITE}You begin to drool as you see this 1988 Pontiac Grand Am.
It is a white 2-door model with bucket seats.  Between the
buckets sits a 5-speed shifter.  The windows are all tinted
a dark black.  On the rear window you see 2 stickers.  The
first shows the face of a bulldog with the words {BLINK}{RED}"RED DOG"{red}{blink}
written around it.  The second sticker simply reads "Dynomax
Performance Exhausts".  The sunroof is open and the front
end sports a nose bra and black-outs.  The hood hides a
peppy 2.5 Litre Tech Four engine that has obviously just
been replaced.  The trunk hides a huge stereo system.
You can hear the song "New Orleans Is Sinking" by The
Tragically Hip blasting from the subs which are powered 
by a nasty Cobalt amplifier which itself is running from
a Kenwood CD player.  This has to be the nicest Grand Am
you've ever seen.{white}

with dark tinted windows.  The rims are sporty looking with the
"star look".  It has a 4-cylinder engine with a little more than
100 horsepower.  The transmission is a 5-speed manual and the
seat belts are really awkward to get used to.  They are the kind
that automatically do up when the door is closed and the car is
started.  You are glad that yours are the simple kind.{blue)

WOW!!  You sure haven't seen a van quite like this before.  
This one is definitely unique.  The roof is chopped and the 
door handles are shaved to give it a more aerodynamic look.
The rims are definitely not the factory originals and the
tires were not this wide in the production rims.  Despite
all of this, it is still a VAN!

your attention to this car.  You notice that it is a 1992 Ford
Probe GT and doesn't have a rear spoiler on the hatch.  This 
seems strange until you recall that the spoilers were dealer
installed on these cars when they were sold.  It has a 5-speed
tranny and the car is loaded with options.{red}

FORD TEMPO~
Aside from a Mercury Topaz, this has got to be the ugliest car you have ever seen.
It appears to be from the 1985 model year.  The 4-door, automatic does not seem
to appeal to you (it's a wonder that it appealed to anybody!).  Even worse is the
fact that it has a small 4-cylinder engine and as the car (and I use this term loosely)
drove away, you heard an awful squeal coming from the power steering pump.

It was put into production in the late 1990's.  It
reminds you of a glorified Dodge Neon.  The model is
only available in 4-doors and represents an attempt 
at creating an economy/family car.  If it seems to 
closely resemble the Mercury Mystique, you're correct
as they are sister cars.{green}
