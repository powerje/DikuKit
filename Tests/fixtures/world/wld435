{R}Inside the Fen Hollin{r}~

   {BLU}You are standing on the doorstep to the Hallows, the home of the dead 
   kings and stewards of Gondor.  Lying withing these halls are not only 
   the bones and remains of great men, but also the weapons and armor of 
   days long past. Tread cautiously and quietly, lest you wake the souls 
   of the dead.{blu}

{R}On Rath Dinen{r}~

   {BLU}As you travel down Rath Dinen you must go one by one as the walls are far 
   to narrow to allow any more. You notice the names and depictions of great 
   men on the walls, and scenes of many a great battle etched into the floor.{blu}

{BO,RED}The Millenary Forest Maze{bo,red}~

 {BO,BLA}You're standing on the branch of a huge  tree, 200'
 tall or more. The branch  is as  thick as a regular
 tree trunk.  Even taller trees surround yours.  The
 trees canopies touch one  another in  an  intricate
 aerial maze of branches and leaves.  The foliage is
 so thick that you can barely see a yard away.  It's
 impossible to see the  sky above,  even this  high.
 The forest floor is 150' below you, lost in perpetu
 al darkness down there. A fall from here would be..
 ... your last one!{bo,bla}

   {WHI}RIDDLE 5
   A lovely woman, a lady, often locked me
   in a chest, at times she took me out with
   her fingers, and gave me to her lord and 
   loyal master, just as he asked. Then he 
   poked his head inside me, pushed it up 
   until it fitted tightly. I, adorned, was
   bound to be filled with something rough 
   if the loyal lord could keep it up. {whi}

   {MAGE}RIDDLE 4
   Wob is my name, if you work it out
   I'm a fair creature fashioned for battle.
   When I bend, and shoot a deadly shaft 
   from my stomach, I'm very eager to send
   that evil as far away as I can.{mage}

{YELL,BO}LANE 1 RIDDLE 1{yell}~

      {C,BO}Election Speculation
   {W}   On the Island of Perfection there are four political parties-
   The Free Food Party, the Pay Later, the Perfect Parity and the
   Greater Glory. SMith, Brown and Jones were speculating about
   which of them would win the forthcoming election.
      Smith thought it would be either the Free Food PArty or the 
   Pay Later, Brown felt quite confident that it would certainly
   not be the Free Food Party. And Jones expressed the opinion that 
   neither the Pay Later Party nor the Greater Glory Party stood a 
   chance. Only one of them was right.
      {BLU}Which party won?{blu,bo}

   {BLUE,BO}If you have been transferred here, you have decided to
   play the RIDDLE QUEST!!! When the game begins, you will
   be transferred to the first room with a riddle. In this
   room you will see a room description made up of a riddle, 
   four portals, and a mob. Once you figure out your riddle
   you will have the name of the right portal. One portal,
   the right one, will lead you to the next room and the
   next riddle. The other portals are all wrong. They will
   lead you back to the begining of the riddle quest or to
   Market Square where you will have lost this portion of the
   quest. The mob is there so that you may not type get all
   and find the answer to the riddle. Have fun!!!! If you 
   decide that you want to leave the quest you can type enter
   market in any room and you will be transferred back to 
   Market Square.{blue}
