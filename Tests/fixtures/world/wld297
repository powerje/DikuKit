The docks of Midgaard~

   A small fishing boat pulls up to the docks and drops anchor.
   Meanwhile, groups of men carry sacks full of fresh {GREEN,BOLD}fish{green,bold} to the
   market, while workers from another boat make their way up pier 
   with crates full of live {RED,BOLD}lobster{red,bold}. A short man with tattered
   clothing passes by, and the stench of having been out to sea for
   an extended period of time trails behind him.

Midgaard Pier~
  
   The land of the city disappears below the pier and is replaced
   with a calm {BLUE,BOLD}blue{blue,bold} water that is the ocean of Ocol. The wind
   begins to pick up a bit, and waves can be seen forming on the
   horizon. On the right is a sturdy looking boat owned by a man
   who gives tours of the islands that lie south of Midgaard.

End of the pier~

   This is the end of the pier. A few men sit along the sides of the
   pier, their feet dangling over, with fishing rods cast in hopes
   they might catch something for dinner. {WHITE,BOLD}Seagulls{white,bold} circle overhead
   with their focus set on any unattended food the fishermen have
   brought along with them.

Aboard the boat.~
  
   The {YELLOW}wooden{yellow} floorboards of the boat creak softly as you scout
   around above deck. The waves of the {CYAN,BOLD}ocean{cyan,bold} rock the boat lightly
   as a substantial wind fills the sails. Sailors walk by as
   they perform various activities that help the ship to operate

   to be communicating with one another. 
  
   From the looks of the {BLACK}corpse{black} on the ground, they might be
   coordinating some sort of attack. It is probably a good idea
   not to bother them, and move along.

   {GRE,BO}Grass{gre,bo} grows where the amount of sand slowly tapers off, creating
   a natural end to the {YEL,BO}beach{yel,bo}. The ground is somewhat hilly, and begins
   to slope up to form the base of a small mountain, which continues
   west. Another small island can barely be made out past the {WHI,BO}peak{whi,bo}.

   Long blades of grass bend to the will of the wind as a soft

   Animals are free to graze the land without any threat
   from predators since most of the larger beasts were hunted

   Colorful {CYAN,BOLD}birds{cyan,bold} flap about overhead, and all kinds of

Between the Islands~
  
   The {BLUE}water{blu} is low enough here that a path of sorts is created

   {BLA}Ash{bla} is falling from above, making it hard to breathe

Top of the volcano~
  
   Intense {RED,BO}heat{red,bo} from the core of the volcano makes this
   area almost unbearable. To the west, a path leads 
   down into the volcano, probably used by natives for
   sacrificial purposes. Attempting to enter the volcano
   appears to be {BLA,UND}extremely dangerous{bla,und}, and only the bravest
   of warriors should even contemplate it.

   Only a small section of {YE}ground{ye} is available to
   stand on. All around are pools of lava, and 
   every few seconds extremely {RE,BO}hot{red,bo} steam erupts
