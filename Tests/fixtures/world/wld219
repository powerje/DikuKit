The quiet trail~
When you first reached the top of the mountain, you did not notice a 
small path to the south. Now that you notice that path, you decide to
take it and explore further. You wonder what this trail leads to.

looming to the south. You notice that this is not no ordinary ship
you find sailing on the seas, but a ship that looks like it could fly 
through the air.

Oops.~
You leap into the hole and hit the ground below. The first thing you notice 
about this place is that there is no way out. All of a sudden you hear a loud
cackle coming from the corner of the room. A strange little man appears and 
introduces himself as only "Kefka". Kefka points at you and laughs, as he 
warns you that you are about to die. You don't take him very seriously, and he 
gets very annyoed. With one wave of his hand, everything you own shatters and 
crumbles into itty bitty pieces. With another wave of his hand, every bone in 
your body breaks. As you start to realize his power, he waves his hand again 
causing intense seizures, after awhile he stops playing, and totally erases 
you with one final wave of his hand. Good Bye, and have a nice day.

The entrance to the airship~
There is a hatch infront of you that leads to the inside of the airship.
It is not locked, so you can go right in. You wonder who's airship this 
is, and you wonder if you can borrow it.

Inside the airship~
Wow! This airship seems rather comfortable. You feel right at home inside 
the airship, and sit down to take a nap. There is more than meets the eye

Egad! It is a cartoon! You see some people walinkg on a nearby street, and the 
first thing you notice about these people is how strange they look. You've never
seen eyes like that on a normal person before. You even see people with strange
colored hair. You wonder what you look like if your hair was dyed green.

looks like a panda bear. You can't understand the writing, so you don't 
really know what type of a poster it is. The street continues to the east
and west.

litteraly nailed down. They both look pretty tough, however.

The Void!~
This is a very odd place.... This place is where Kefka stashes all the 
rotting corpses of players he's killed in the past. All around you there
is a terrible smell of all the rotting corpses and skeletons of these 
poor adventures. The blood stained walls send a shiver up and down your
spine. If you are not careful this is where your corpse might end 
up in the near future
