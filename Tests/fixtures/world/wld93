A Mountain Path~
          You are on a mountain path which ascends a steep mountainside.  The
trail curves around the mountain so that you cannot really see what
lies ahead.  You do sense great power though coming from the area
behind the mountain.

Mountainside Tombs~
          There are a few stone heaps here and there, the tombs of those who
did not last the arduous journey up the mountain.  Curiously you notice
a few uncovered bodies which dont seem to have died of exhaustion.  The
path curves east around the mountain.

A Blind Curve on the Mountain Path.~
          This looks like a normal mountain path, but it is NOT!  This section
of the path is habitated by a huge (and of course, man-eating) Cyclops.
The path makes its final ascent to an overlook.

Vista~
          This is a stunning vista overlooking a canyon.  There is a sign here
that says : "BEHOLD -- ELEMENTAL CANYON".
  Fire leaps up from firepits in the western part of the canyon.  The sky
looks funny, and the air seems hazy to the northwest.  Electricity sparks
intermitantly in the northeast.  To the east you see a strong, magic-
looking river flowing through the canyon.  Also to the east you spy a cave
enterence leading into the canyon wall.  The path descends to the north to
anoher overlook.  Out of the corner of your eye you notice a hint. . .

The Electric Playground~
          Though there is a seemingly carefree atmosphere here, you sense that
something much more important takes place near by.  There is an electric
path heading away south.  The playground extends north and west.

Lightning Causeway~
          Up a set of stairs carved into the hill you see intermittant flashes of
lightning.  A continuous humm also comes form that direction.  To the west
it the electric playground.

Lightning Chamber~
          There is some sort of control panel here. Apparently the Lightning Ruler
observes and controls electric forces from here.  A set of steps carved into
the hill lead down to a causeway.

Floating in Air~
          Last you knew you were walking on the mesa.  The abruptly the path dropped
from beneath your feet much to quick for you to recover.  Instead of plunging
to your death, you seemingly miss the ground and begin walking on air.  The
space to the north and east seems just thin air, but you can walk there.  The
pathway you came from is to the south.

Floating in Air~
          You look down and see the ground 100 feet below you.  The wind whispering
in your ear seems to reassure you that this is fine.  To the north a ways you
spy a portal of sorts.  To the west is more thin air.

  A tunnel leads east. To the west you can enter a portal. The wind in
this tunnel is quite fierce, it seems as if its forced.

Victor's Sexual Playground~
        You are aghast! The whole room is totally oriented towards the pursuit of
sexual pleasure. You notice a very voluptuous, half naked woman lying in
the king sized water-bed. Beside her, among the undone sheets, are a 
couple of "toys", and there is a varied assortment of flavoured condoms on
the night table. Another thing that catches your attention is the very large 
mirror placed directly above the bed, on the ceiling.
It is clear to you that this Victor individual has been a very naughty boy,
and is in dire need of a sound spanking! ;)

She is incredibly sexy, and you can see a hint of cleavege, between the sheets
that partially cover her incredible body.

condoms~
Yummy! Strawberry, Grape, Beer flavoured condoms! You feel like tasting them!
~
E
bed ~
It looks very inviting, despite the fact its blue sheets are totally undone, and
the pillows are all over the place. It looks as if Victor's just finished 
using it.

You see yourself on the ceiling... wooooowwwww.
