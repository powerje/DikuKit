Zepher's Shop of Horrors!~

   {R}What is this sick room?!  All around you, you see lab tables,
   scary-looking scalpels, blood-stained kleenexes, and rusty iron
   pliers.  *CRACK!*  *BOOM!*  You jump as thunderous lightning
   lights up the sky and this gloomy dark room is briefly lit up,
   and you recoil with horror from the moving shapes shuffling
   about this room!  Even more horrific, they all LOOK EXACTLY THE
   SAME!  Who could be behind these horrible experiments?  WHO???{r}

{BLACK}The Great Library of Arclaeen{black}~
{BLACK}
   As you enter this room the large stone doors swing silently shut 
   behind you.  As you glance about in the dim light you see a 
   large ebony table surrounded with  several soft leather chairs.  
   The room is huge and extends into the horizon.  The walls on 
   either side are shelved with more books than you have ever seen.  
   The  bookshelves extend high into the rafters and walkways 
   extend away at each level.  There are two large gargoyles 
   perched precariously above either side of the stone door.
