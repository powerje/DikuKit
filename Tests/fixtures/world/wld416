  Recent excavation on Northern Crossroads has led to the discovery  of something
  quite amazing.  A land full  of mythical animals  and long forgotten  creatures
  now presents itself  for  exploration.  The  Immortals would  like to challenge
  all to see  what there is to see and find what there is to find.  All who enter 
  through these gates should  be warned that this area has not yet been made safe
  by the Immortals and that entrance is "at your own risk."

  Ahead lies the Garden of Heathen.  Is this a  parody of a Biblical land or is
  it something else entirely?  Will a Serpent offer an apple to an unsuspecting
  couple or do other surprises await to present themselves?  Ahead lies a field
  decked out in  the greens  of spring and the colors of the rainbow bloom from
  stems growing from the  fertile ground.  It is almost  enough to make someone
  remember  stories told on Sunday mornings of the beauty and  freshness of the
  perfect home for mankind.

{G}
  A large atypical tree rises from the earth, it's fingers reaching for the
  sky.  The green leaves contrast nicely with the ripe  fruit that seems to
  ripen in every color of the rainbow.  Some of the fruit are long and thin
  while others are  round and fat.  High up  in the branches, something can
  be seen, and whatever it is, it's quite large.  The  branches obscure the
  view of whatever it is, but it is round, brown and at the  top of a tree.

{GR} 
  At the upper levels of the tree the branches are still thick enough to support
  whatever weight is placed upon them.  The tempting, brightly colored fruit is
  even closer  now and all of it can actually  be reached.  The leaves that all
  were so green from the ground can now  be seen quite clearly and none of the
  leaves appear to be the same.  Oak leaves, pine needles  and just about every
  other tree that exists seems to be represented by  the branches of this tree.
 
  The item above is definitely a nest but the size of it makes it impossible to
  see if anything or anyone is inside it. The breeze blowing through the leaves
  disguises the sound of anything that may be in the nest.

{C,BO}
  A giant waterfall spills water from  the very heights of heaven
  down to earth forming a small pool which in turn feeds a gently
  flowing stream.  A heavy mist hangs in the air at the bottom of
  the  waterfall with a bright colored  rainbow forever suspended 
  in the center of it.  Here forever is proof that there is not a
  pot of gold at the end of rainbow, but  there is a land of milk
  and honey.  The sound of the water crashing on the rocks causes
  ringing in the ears of anyone close enough to hear it, drowning
  out any other sounds.

  The ripples on  the surface of this small pond cause miniscule waves that
  lap at the sandy shore.  The soft sand easily holds the footprints of any
  that walk on it.  Right now the only prints that can be seen are the ones
  of many small animals who come to drink.  The clear blueness of the water
  brings to mind just thoughts of purity and virginity.  To taste the fluid
  that makes all other water seem inferior is to taste the nectar of heaven
  which  was rained  down  to earth to create this  beautiful  pond.  Those
  thoughts  immediately squashed  by dread that  if this water is drank, no 
  other would refresh again.

{BO}{B}a{b} {C}Swirling{c} {BO}{BLU}Pool{b} {BO}{B}of{b} {BO}{C}Water{c}~

  {C}The water in the pond begins to ripple and splash violently. You watch
  as a whirlpool of immense strength begins to form within the center of
  the pond.  The force of it's pull draws you closer and closer into the
  eye of the vortex. You feel a rush of water slam down upon you and soon
  you are enveloped down into the deep, blue waters of the pond{c}.
   
  {R}How long can you hold your breath{r}? {BO}{R}Good Luck{r}

  {BLU}You gasp for air as you are pulled into the  depths of the pond.
  The  rush of the  water thrashes your body repeatedly as you try
  to fight  your way back up to the  surface{b}.  {BO}{BLU}Suddenly the  water
  calms as you feel a sense of relief.  The water down here is now
  clearly visible and you find yourself surrounded by the mythical
  creatures known by most as {G}Merms{g}. {C}Strange creatures indeed, half
  human, half fish, they are peaceful in nature but if threatened,
  become very protective among their own kind{c}.

{BO}{B}End of the Caves{b}~

  {BO}{Y}Look!  Up ahead!  There's finally some light!!
   
  {G}As the echoing seems to stop at the end of this cave, things begin
  to look hopeful.  Finally, you see a light shining in from the outside,
  and as you proceed closer,  the fresh scent of pine and other  foliage
  begins to fill the air?

{M}Slashing {BO}{B}through the {BO}{G}Foliage{g}~
{GR,BO} 
  Ahead lies a forest. This forest, unlike the rest of what has been seen so far,
  doesn't look very  inviting.  The sun seems  to have a hard time penetrating to
  the lower levels of the  forest.  That doesn't leave the ground as clear as one
  would imagine.  Fallen branches, decaying remains, and a small amount of under-
  growth all litter  the floor, while the lower  branches and moss hang down from
  the trees.  This place just gives off an aura of death and doom.  What happened
  to the beauty and serenity?

  Near the top of the tree the branches get thinner. This turns out to

  Towering far in to the sky  and breaking the path of the clouds is a
  set of Pearly Gates.  No lock appears to break the perfect lines and

  for  an unimaginable amount of money, but desecration of these gates
  would probably be a bad idea.  The question at this point would have
  to be if these gates are what they appear to be, who would be worthy
