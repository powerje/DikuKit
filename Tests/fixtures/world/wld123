Poet's Abode~
You find yourself in a spacious, comfortable-looking room.  The shelves are
packed with books, CD's, video-cassettes, and comics.  You also notice a
computer terminal with a strangely familiar dragon logo on the screen.

A massive banner bears flowing script:

"Put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be
able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand.

                                                  -- Ephesians 6:13"

RIFT~
You are standing before a huge portal of magical energy.  It crackles and spits
as it lights up the area with a soft blue glow.

Huge fiery letters burn brightly in front of the gateway.

You leap excitedly through the glowing rift with anticipation and . . .

Well gee, this "other" world looks just like the one you left behind.  Another
dragon . . . ho hum.

What the heck is this . . . THING?!~
Perhaps this world IS alien in nature after all. Before you stands a creature
that seems to be part man, but mostly machine.

Naw, dragons are real but cyborgs are pure fantasy . . . right?

Chi-Town~

Burbs, like a man-made mountain of concrete and steel.

The huge city gates are guarded by a monstrous 30 foot tall Spider Skull

Inside the Skull-Walker~
You clamber into the body of the gigantic war machine.  The controls are far
beyond your understanding.  There are instruments for controlling the spider-
like legs and the various weapons systems, but you haven't the foggiest idea
how to operate them.

Looking around, you realize why you got inside without being blown to bits:
the entire crew has fallen asleep on duty.
