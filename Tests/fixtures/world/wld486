The Doors in the side of the Mountain!~

   You're standing on a large ledge on the side of a mountain! How the heck
   did that happen! The cold wind whips your hair and tries to push you
   around! Behind you are two large wooden doors that look like
   they belong in a city! They're both hung perfectly and inexplicibly in
   the bedrock of the mountain!
 
   The one to the east has the symbol of the city of Midgaard glowing on
   it, and the one to the north has the symbol of the city of Eudelta
   glowing on it.
 
   The ledge itself starts to wrap around the mountain to the south, and
   narrows significantly! You peak over the edge to the west and all you
   can see are the tops of the clouds! Weren't you just in a city a minute
   ago?? You really don't want to slip or walk the wrong way, that looks
   like a very long fall...

Outside the heavy iron doors.~

   The ledge has widened and is finally starting to level out. As you
   approach the end of the path it looks to the north like there's a huge
   iron door mounted into the mountain itself! Over the doors you see
   "Eluryh" inlaid in gold with a TriSkelion is inlaid in gold in the door.
 
   To the south the ledge leads down the mountain, the solid mountainside
   rises up to the west, and the east is a steep drop off into the clouds!

The entranceway.~

   The entranceway is dominated by massive carved arched passage to the
   north. On the keystone a TriSkelion symbol is inlaid, it's golden glow
   pulsing like a beating heart.
 
   On the south is the door outside. Heavy iron, but hung very well and
   can swing easily. They're made tight enough to keep out all breezes
   and weather.
 
   There's a plaque hanging on the wall titled "Welcome to Eluryh". You
   should probaby read it.

plaque welcome~

   Welcome To Eluryh!
 
   Hello traveller in Northern Crossroads, and thank you for your interest
   in Eluryh! The Kingdom is in need of your help!
 
   A nasty creature named Zhumon has scattered our citizens and captured
   our wonderful Queen [Zelda]! All of the champions that have tried to
   help us have failed, leaving Zhumon and his minions to rule the land!
 
   You are welcome to visit our land, but please be advised that Zhumon's
   minions are very powerful. As you can see only Advanced characters are
   allowed to visit and everyone is advised to be ... careful. Those
   who are true {RE}-=({re}{YE}Ch{ye}{YE,BO}a{ye,bo}{YE}mp{ye}{YE,BO}io{ye,bo}{YE}n{ye}{RE})=-{re}s are the most suited to visiting Eluryh.
 
   If you wish to take up our cause and cleanse our Kingdom of Zhumon and
   his minions, there is an old man in a cave that will start you on your
   quest to become the champion of the Eluryhian people!

The anteroom.~

   The anteroom has two passageways.
 
   The north passageway is carved out of the raw bedrock of the mountain!
   It also has a TriSkelion symbol inlaid in gold in the keystone of the
   arch. The bottom left segment of the TriSkelion throbs with a golden
   light!
 
   To the south is the passageway back to the entrance and there's also a
   cave carved down some stairs into the Mountain.

Morgue.~

   The darkness of the Morgue is opressive, it's like this is where
   darkness is created and it just covers the world every night by oozing
   out of this room. You can hear the sounds of fleshy things being removed
   all around you, but you can never seem to find them, just walls almost
   all around. It's a small room, with a counter top in front of you.
 
   There's a small fire burning somewhere behind it, and the stairs curl up
   into brightness.

Cavern Of Champions!~

   Proudly displayed on pedestals arranged artfully around the room, in the
   material of their choosing, are the champions! Their splendor and
   artistry bring tears to your eyes! The likenesses of the champions is so
   breathtaking that you feel as if they could walk right up and begin
   having a conversation with you!
 
   Covering almost all the wall surfaces in an endless and everchanging
   sea, are the heads of the fallen, stuffed and mounted. Their final
   expressions of fear and pain captured forever.
 
   Carved out of the solid mountainside, a spiral staircase descends into the
   darkness beneath you. Inlaid into the ground at the top of the staircase
   is the word "Morgue"...
 
   To the south is a massive arched passage carved out of the bedrock,
   leading to the anteroom.
 
   In the center of the room, under a large TriSkelion symbol, is a hole
   in the air, just a blank, empty nothing!
