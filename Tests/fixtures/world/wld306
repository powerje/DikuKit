Switch.~
{G}
  Switch is used to switch over to a mob, and take control over it.
  When you are switched into a mob, your immortal will become invisible,
  and you can use the mob to move around, talk and gossip. This also
  is not to be abused like switching to a blocking mob in a zone your
  mort is doing and moving it out of the way, and breaking this rule
  will be dealt with SEVERLY. Switch is great for avoiding the use of
  the force command which spams the higher ups. Switch into your mob 
  and wear all...

  the zone you are standing in. By typing zreset ## you will 
  be able to reset that zone. You should never reset a zone with
  the reason that a group of mortals wishes to do that zone. Zreset
  should be used to reset what you are working on. Use your best
  judgement! Afterall, you are a wizard now.

  Typing darklevel will not only explain darklevels to you, but 
  give you the darklevel of the room in you are in. It looks like
  this...
{C} 
  Usage: darklevel <level> (-1 to 20)
         darklevel <level> zone (-1 to 20)
  Current darklevel: 4
{C}
   Set to -1 for invariant base darklevel of 3, regardless of time.
   Darklevels 0-2 represent levels of light (0 = intense, 2 = bright).
   Darklevel 1 represents the high-noon value.
   Darklevel 3 represents the base level of dark/light during daylight.
   Darklevel 4 represents daybreak/nightfall value.
   Darklevel 6 represents twilight value.
   Darklevel 9 represents night value.
   Darklevel above 15 is quite dark, above 17 requires magical light to see.
   To make the darklevel invariant at different times of the day, 
   the DARK flag must be set.

{G}
  Snoop allows you to see everything a certain player does, sees,
  or says. It is a great way to help fix aliases or colour problems.
  Unless you suspect a mortal of cheating you must ALWAYS ask for 
  permission to snoop. If you do suspect that a mortal is cheating
  ask to speak to someone about it on wiz channel and begin snooping.
  If you seem to be having trouble while learning to create, you 
  might wish to ask a more experienced immortal of a higher level
  to snoop you and see what's giving you trouble.

Force~
{G}
  Force is used to command a player or mob to do something such 
  as wear/remove objects, set alias, edit alias, etc. Keep in
  mind that this command is not to be abused. Forcing a mortal
  to do anything they don't want done is illegal. On rare occasions
  you may wish to use this command to help a new player set colour
  defaults or fix aliases. However, it is better if you can avoid
  forcing and teach them how to do it on their own.

  Before you newbize a character be sure that it is the first 
  character of this player. Explain to them that the newbie flag
  will  protect them from harm for a few levels and invite more
  experienced players to share advice and offer help. If they wish
  not to wear the flag respect their wishes.

  peace around here is during an immortal battle where there is 
  much spam. Perhaps later we'll show you what that means. :)

  The purge command is used to get rid of or delete items and mobs
  from a room. Be careful when using this command as you may purge 
  something you didn't intend to purge. Typing purge mob will delete
  the first mob in the room. Typing purge smurfette will purge just 
  smurfette. Typing purge by itself will clear the room of everything
  except other players. As tempting as it might be at times DO NOT
  purge other players or you will suffer severe consequences.

Gambit's Den~
 
The smell of cajun cooking sends you reeling with memories of the deep
south. Those cajun spices and foods sure do make your mouth water! Looking
out the windows you can see the bayou and swamps and magnolia trees. 
Plenty of photos adorn the walls that the charming rogue calls home. You
can see pictures of all the HELLIONS after they have ruthlessly slaughtered
all the members of the other clubs. Such pleasant memories! You are
surprised to see a small lab where the cajun cooks up some unpleasant
mischief for those who would stand in his way! The place abound with
charisma and charm - the charisma and charm of GAMBIT!
