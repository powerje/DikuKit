   Any equipment that you want donated can be left in this room.  Chances
   are, even after a crash, the equipment will still be here.  You see a
   large sign above you which states, "There's NO GUARANTEE that someone
   won't take your stuff.  The Underworld is not responsible for personal
   losses." Do not donate something if you don't want someone else to have
   it.  Also, if you donate limited items, they will be destroyed in the

Strae's Labirynth~

  Fighting against spider webs you stumble into the cave. Pausing 
  for a breath your eyes try to adjust to the darkness and the complete 
  silence offers a moment of introspection.  

  {R}Damn. you've taken a wrong turn. How the hell did you get here? {r}

  At the far end of the cave a multiplicity of paths onwards present 
  themselves. How should you choose? The urge to linger in the warmth 
  of nothingness invites you. - Then a flicker seen out of the corner of 
  your eyes. Searching the shadows you realize that maybe you aren't 
  alone after all.

   riches decorate the walls - great portraits of valiant warriors
   hang proudly here.  You stand in awe over the massive golden

   As you awake you notice a tall figure with a huge mace over your

   You seem to be hovering above a large cave in which
   the corpses of the Underworld Knights' enemies have
   dropped.  The acrid smell of death teases your nostrils
   as you realize that invaders are often the first ones
   to be served the death blow.

Welcome to Image's Room~
You are standing in what appears to be a dark chasm of some sort and
feel an eerie presence around you... like you are being watched.  That
would be the understatement of the day!  You see a faint image of light
darting across the wall.  Just as you look, a wisp of a blade comes
toward your throat.  The shadow sees you and reveals himself... come
on... sit on the sofa...

   If you are here, you are at the edge of the Underworld Knights'
   elaborate maze.  Be careful as you proceed, for if you are an 
   invader, the true members of the Underworld Knights will 
   dispense you with GREAT prejudice.  This sacred club of elite
   and new warriors was wrought from the finest of this realm.  
   They teach the younger knights their magical ways of their arts.

{BLUE}Eilserus's Dominion of Despair{blue}~
Stumbling through the dark doorway, you trip and fall over a pair of
Doc Martins that have been carelessly tossed aside.  A large Nine
Inch Nails banner lines one wall; and bottles of Pete's Wicked Ale
are thrown about.  A nice Rotel stereo system sits in the corner
with Ministry blaring through a pair of Vandersteens 1B's.  CD's
litter the top of the Rotel pre-amp and you notice such cool groups
as NIN, Ministry, Bad Religion, Suicidal Tendencies, Skinny Puppy,
and other assorted names of punk and industrial bands.
The lyrics:
     "Just get out of my face and watch me DIE!!! ...Burning Inside
     ...Burning Inside... Burning Inside..."
ring clearly in your sensitive ears and you calmly think, "Fuck...
this chick is fucking insane!"  It's time for you to jet before she
catches you in here!

{GREEN,BO} falling from what appears to be empty space. As the
{GREEN,BO} rain now spreading throughout your body you find
{GREEN,BO} yourself in a fully grown forest. There is a large 
{GREEN,BO} booming explosion off in the distance while a thick
{GREEN,BO} burst of {BLACK,BOLD}smoke {GREEN,BOLD}fills your lungs. You look up into
{GREEN,BO} the sky and notice a flash of a {YELLOW,BOLD}yellow gold glow
{GREEN,BO} coming from behind the mountains. While frantically
{GREEN,BO} coughing out all of the {BLACK,BOLD}black ash {GREEN,BOLD}in your lungs
{GREEN,BO} balls of {RED,BOLD}flame {GREEN,BOLD}quickly fall from the sky onto your
{BL,BO} darkened skin {GR,BO}and {RE,BO}scorch your burning flesh{GR,BO}.{b}

The Unknown River~
  You are travelling on the Unknown River.  The river is pretty shallow.  
Looking down, you can almost see all the rocks and fish underneath.  The 
water is very clean and clear.  Sticking your finger into the water 
underneath, you get a tingling feeling.....
  You can barely see what's ahead of you.....
    As you carefully listens, you can hear the sound of ancient chinese
      music coming from the south.

Unknown's Private Chamber~
    You are in a small ordinary room.  The room is filled with trash.
By the left wall there is a large oak desk with a small lamp on top.
Straight ahead you see a large portrait of a tall beautiful blonde.
There's a small hand written message at the bottom of the portrait.
As you examine closer, you notice the portrait has been shifted
from it's original position.  Maybe you should help Unknown
reposition his mistress's portrait :)

portrait~
You see a beautiful young lady dressed in a long red dress.  She
is the cutest thing you ever seen.  From her appearance, you can
sense that's she's only in her early 20.  Now why would Unknown
hang such a picture around his room.....
At the bottom of the portrait is a hand written message.

        "To Him:
            Don't make me kill you...because I will.
                         From: Sandy"

{BLUE,BOLD}   this room. Dust has settled on the floor and the lights
{BLUE,BOLD}   flicker before steadying as you hit the switch. The room

{BLUE,BOLD}   amongst the additions left untouched.

{BLUE,BOLD}     Suddenly your eyes settle on a portion of the floor that
{BLUE,BOLD}   appears to have been cleaned, inhabited. An empty {GREEN,BOLD}Monster can
{BLUE,BOLD}   leaves a ring in the dust from where it sat. A heart has been
{BLUE,BOLD}   drawn by someones finger. Your sense of {WHITE,BOLD}absence {BLUE,BOLD}is replaced

{C}Council{BO}{BLU} Chambers{blu}~
  
   These chambers are the abode of the Old Council of the Underworld Knights.
   Here, ages ago, leaders discussed the politics and club policies which 
   would affect its members.  Because of increasing dissention in the club,
   The Underworld Knights felt the icy hand of death creeping among them.  
   Because of the dedication of one member, Wyverns, the challenges a club
   must face were met.  As life took its toll on this valiant leader, another
   stepped up to take his place.  His name was Arfon.  Soon another warrior 
   emerged to assist Arfon with his task of building the club back up.  His name
   was Rathus who continues to lead even to this day.
