   The inside of this temple is austere yet majestic.  The pillars of
marble sweep up to the ceiling, melting into the dome overhead without
a seam.  A blazing red carpet leads from the entrance to the throne in
the center of the room.  This is truly the home of a great sage!

   This can hardly be a bedroom--this is a room so spartan surely no
human could spend any time here at all!  There is a small pallet in
one corner, with a chair and a paper-stand next to it.  A small lamp
lights up that small area, leaving the rest of the room enshrouded in
darkness.  In the gloom to the west, you can barely make out a large
steel door.

{C}The {BLA,BO}Edge {bo,C}of {Y,BO}Luck{y,bo}~
   A blast of sound and music assault you as you enter this gambling
parlor.  This is a high class place, where the rich and idle of Kerofk
go to blow off steam and lose lots of money.  The whole place is
decorated in shades of red, and most of the windows face the nearby
cliff-- evidently to give the gamblers within that feeling of danger.
The elegance is fabulous, and you feel as if you might want to join
in.

they are there just for show.  A few vicious exotic weapons are also

{C}History {W}of {BLU,BO}Kerofk{blu,bo}~
   This is an 'accidental room', provided only for room continuity.
   And so, the history of Kerofk...
   The city of Kerofk originated in the mind of Builder_5, as a major
city for use in a role-playing game he was running at the time (a
heavily modified version of Powers & Perils--a very out-of-print
Avalon Hill game).  Amanda Eterniale was a player in this game, and
loved the city.
   About this time, Amanda received an invitation to build on the
now-defunct AlbertMUD.  She was taught how to build by an imp
named MJPrime there, and her first creation was the city of Kerofk,
in honor of Builder_5's game.
   AlbertMUD died in a fairly nasty manner, and about half a year
later, Amanda convinced one of the imps to email her her areas.  She
gave them to Builder_5, smiled, and said,
   "Edit these?  Please?"
   Builder_5 took the better part of 3 months to edit, fix, and convert
these files into a version more suitable for a public release.  This
is what you have now.
   Both of us hope you enjoy this area, over a year in the making...

   Unpruned trees block out what little light there was outside the
garden in this close area.  A small fountain/pool of tarnished marble
sits in the center, with scum and algae covering its surface.  Small
creatures flit deep in its depths, and you are not sure you want to
know exactly what they are.
   You can head south, to the garden's entrance, or west, to a more
open area in the garden.

{C}In the {G}Garden{g}~
   Here the garden looks dark and ominous, yet strangely beautiful.
An easel has been set up here, and some art supplies lie on the
ground, waiting to be used.  Faint light trickles down through the
leaves like water on this scene, and you feel strangely at peace with
the garden, recognizing it for the single growing entity it is.

   Ugh! The garden is absolutely dead here!  Fumes from the decaying
plant matter make you dizzy and nauseous.  What ever killed the plants
you want no part of.  Perhaps leaving post-haste would be wise.

{R}Ha{Y}ll{R}wa{Y}y{y}~
   This hallway was once tapestried in beautiful colors, and well-
illuminated by the lamps on the walls.  Now the tapestries are
thread-worn and moth-eaten and most the lamps have disappeared,
leaving dark holes in the walls.  There is a door to your left and one
to your right, both slightly ajar.  A window to your north looks out
to an alley behind a gambling parlor, and to the south is the main
room of the mansion.

{M}Sitting {Y}Room{y}~
   Lots of extremely old, plush chairs sit about here.  A few tables
covered with doilies are scattered about, and a large hutch filled
with ancient cracked china stands against the north wall.  This looks
like one of those rooms that are just for show and not for everyday
use.  However, the thick layer of dust covering everything belies the
neatness of the arrangement of furniture.

{W}A {BLA,BO}Trashed {bo,W}Room{w}~
   This room looked to be a library once.  Now all the furniture has
been moved out but for the bookshelves, which are now falling apart.
It looks like a great deal of violence has occurred in this room, as
if thousands of fights have occurred here over the years.  You wonder
who could be capable of such wanton destruction.

   This section off the interior hallway looks well trodden from the
tracks in the dust on the floor.  There are doors to the east and
west, and northwards is the main room of the mansion.  A window once
graced the south end of this hallway, but it has since been boarded up
from the outside.

{R}Dining {Y}Room{y}~
   This was once a grand dining hall.  Now the great oak table has
been completely broken and leaned up against one wall to make room for
a small folding table and a few chairs taking its place.  Obviously
the current owners of this mansion don't care much about this place to
let it fall into ruin so.

{W}Second {Y}Floor {R}Ha{Y}ll{R}wa{Y}y{y}~
   This is the hallway at the top of the stairs, that leads
north-south.  Doors line the hallway in both directions, and you can
go down to the main room.  A big, ten foot tall window on the west
wall of the stairwell seemed to have been a stained-glass window once,
but has been worn and cracked by time to just be shards of colored
glass that doesn't even keep the wind out.

{W}Kitchen{w}~
   As all the other rooms in this house, this kitchen has been mostly
destroyed by time and inconsideration by the current owners.  There is
still some fresh food lying about, but a rotten smell fills the air,
and you see small insects scuttling about in the trash on the floor.
The one thing that is sure is that you don't want to eat anything that
was prepared here!

   This hallway ends short to allow the fireplace in the kitchen to
reach the roof.  A single door is set in the east wall, and the hall
leads north to where the stairwell leads down.

{BLU,BO}Bed{bo,C}room{c}~
   This bedroom has been made up for two people.  There are bunk beds
in the center of the room, and different sets of run-down furniture on
each side.  On the right is a rather neat desk, chair, a chest of
drawers, and on the left there is just a mess of clothes, papers,
books, and half-eaten food.  There isn't much interesting here,
though.

   This hall leads to the northern part of the second floor, where two
bedrooms lead off to the east and west.  There is nothing remotely
interesting here, since the general decrepency of the house is now no
longer 'new' to you.  Another window looks out over top a gambling
parlor to the north, where you see several low-life types walking and
staggering in and out.  The starlight filtering in through the window
makes this hall a bit more illuminated than the rest of the house.

{Y,BO}Guest {bo,Y}Bed{Y,BO}room{y,bo}~
   This is a tiny little room, about 6 feet square and containing only
a small bed, a small night-table and a stepladder leaning against the
wall in one corner.  A lot of disturbed dust on the floor makes you
wonder what this room is being used for, since it is obvious no one
has used the bed for a _long_ time.

{M}Bed{M,BO}room{m,bo}~
   You would guess that a young woman lives in this room, from the
quality and newness of the clothes that are stacked neatly in the open
hope-chest, and the different cosmetics lined up on a shelf just below
a mirror on the far wall.  A small sleeping pallet lies rolled-up on
the floor neatly, and you notice that there is hardly any dust
anywhere in this room, making it seem somewhat 'fresh' despite the
run-down-ness of the rest of the household.

{Y}Attic{y}~
   This is the attic of the house.  There are shelves built into the
sides of the roof all around with strange objects floating in jars
stacked on them.  The smell of formaldehyde is very strong here and
you begin to feel faint.  There's a door built into a partition to the
south...maybe you can make it...

   Something smells quite dead here.
   There is a queen-sized bed taking up most of this small attic
room. Some clothes are spread about in disorder and the bed isn't
made.  A single chair is pulled up to a writing desk, where it looks
like someone works frequently.  Up here it is very chill, much colder
than it is outside.
