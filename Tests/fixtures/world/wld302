A Secret Passage~
  You are in a dank and musty corridor that smells rancid.  Small
rodents and insects scurry by your feet making you shudder in
disgust.  A scream can be heard in the distance making your spine
shiver.  You attempt to ignore the creatures around you and 
concentrate on the direction of the scream.

A Prison Chamber~
   You have come to the end of the passageway.  To the North, West
and East lie heavy steel doors in which seem to be impenetrable from
any sort of an attack.  The screams are now louder than ever and you
can easily make out voices to the door to the west.  The stupid
little rodents are pestering the hell out of you and the dark
rancid smell is really starting to annoy you.  You feel as if your
going to have a nervous breakdown right here until a small voice is heard
from your feet.  "North! Go North!" a rat snickers.  What the frick?!
A talking rodent! AHHH! Have you lost your mind?  You shrug your
shoulders and after furiously attempting to open the western cell
with no luck, north is your only choice.

Meeting The Little Rodents~
   As you enter the room you notice something.. rats! heh!
You've never seen so many rats in one spot in your life.  They seem
to be be looking at you quite peculiar...  A crowned rat at the
far end of the room stands and begins to clear his throat.  
After looking at the other rats, he begins to speak in a ratherly
odd english accent, "Have I not promised you the a delicious meal?
Have I not foretold of the coming of the "Grazans?( thats you )
Well, It is time for us to feast my people!" A loud cheer is heard
from the surrounding rats.  Then the crowned rats screams at the
top of his lungs, "ATTACK MY PEOPLE!!"

Ack! What the fricka?! The rats are attacking you?! Eek!
Quick! Get out the broom and defend yerself!

The Acid Worm~
   * * * THE MOB IN THIS ROOM SPITS ACID * * * 

Congragulations on getting to this room!  This is basically a 
challenge room that you shouldnt tell many people about.  The mob in
this room however, spits acid.  Acid mobs will destroy items in
your inventory and will greatly reduce the armor-class of an item.
This mob isnt aggressive and doesnt hit too hard but it does 
spit acid.  This is just a little example of what to expect when
you get to those high-level zones that have acid mobs.  

Good Luck !!!

The Cell Of Queen Saliakezan~
   Upon entrance to the room, you notice a massive man raise a
huge axe and deliver a final blow to helpless woman.  You instantly
jump in front of the woman and demand for it to stop at once.
As you look deeper into the figures eyes, however, you feel a strong
sense of fear and begin to panic.. As you attempt to flee the room
the woman grabs hold of your legs and prevents you from moving!
You panic and attempt to flee but to no avail.. Eek!

Theres only way to get this woman off you sadly enough..

Inside The Fountain~
   It seems that you have shrunk in size upon entering the portal.
You are about the size of the ant and are swimming in a fountain.
You nervously splash about the fountain, hoping to find a way to
get out of the fountain and get back to your normal size.

The Center of the Fountain~
  You have finally made it to the center of this fountain.  I must
admit you must have looked real cute doggie-paddling in a fountain.
It seems however that the fish around you are displeased with you
interfering in their environment.

  {Y}The decaying corpse of Jarazel lies decomposing near the far right 
  corner of this room.  Upon sight of such a grotesque sight, your 
  last meal feels the need to come up and spread itself throughout the
  room.  Despite the disgusting mess, you and your partner lift some 
  boxes and search carefully every inch of the room.  You find a lot
  of deceased people and bones in boxes, but contained within each
  of those boxes is a hefty amount of coins which you excitedly place 
  in your pocket.{y}
