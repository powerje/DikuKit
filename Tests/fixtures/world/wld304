Walking along an Autumn Path~

        You are walking along a stately dirt path through a meadow.
Huge majestic oak trees line both sides of the path, the leaves turning
gloriously autumn brown.  A thick pine forest is to the left of the
path, and a corn field is to the right, ready for harvest.  It seems
completely serene around here.

Walking along an Autumn Path~

     As you continue further down the beautiful path, you begin
to notice some odd things.  First there is completely no sound
whatsoever.  Not even any birds chirping.  Strange.  But it seems
so peaceful around here that you decide to shrug it off.

At a Bend in the Autumn Path~

        Walking further down the path, you come to a bend in the
path, which turns east.  However, the air has grown cooler and you
can see faint wispy trails of mist creeping over the path.  Even
stranger still is that the once-stately and beautiful oaks have
taken on a slightly sinister look somehow.

Approaching a Covered Wooden Bridge~

    The slowly creeping mist is growing thicker across the path.
You feel a bit uneasy about the mysterious mist.  Where did it come
from?  Why did it get cool all of a sudden?  Suddenly you feel the
urge to turn back.  But then ahead of you to the east is a beautiful
covered wooden bridge.  You wonder if it might be better on the other
side?

In Front of a Covered Wooden Bridge~

       You are standing in front of the covered wooden bridge spanning
across a shallow burbling creek.  The oak tree branches are thicker
overhead, blocking out most of the sun, making the area dark and
sinister.  It might be your imagination but the trees seem to leer
at you evilly and the path is almost completely covered in the mist
as well.

West End of the Covered Wooden Bridge~

        You are standing inside the west end of the covered bridge.
The boards creak under your feet ominously and you swallow hard.
Maybe entering this bridge wasnt such a good idea after all.
Looking back, you see that the mist is somehow so thick that you
cannot even see the path outside the bridge.  To the far east,
you can see the mist also gathering over that end too.

feel disoriented, as if you lost your sense of directly.  Youre not
exactly sure which way is east now!  You also have an odd sense of
being at the center of the universe in this spot.  The floor groans

There is nothing but the gray swirling mist out there.  You cant

nowhere else to go but wander into that damn mist...

as you hurry down the street.  You can see the dock ahead to the
north, and you can smell the sea.  You gag a little at the foul stench
of rotting fish.

On the Docks of Port d'Elhour~

        Standing on a dock, you stare out at the sea.  It seems to
stretch out as far as the eye can see.  However, the horizon has
been cloaked by that now-familiar mist so you cannot tell exactly
how far the sea stretches to.  The sky is gray and cloudy, and
the wind blows steadily, carrying the foul stench of rotting
fish and algae and salt water to your nose.

Squeezing into a Narrow Crack~

        You discover a narrow fissure, thats just barely wide and
high enough for you to squeeze into.  Suddenly without any warning,
the floor crumbles under you and you with a scream you plunge down
into the darkness. . .

Drowning in a Watery Grave!~

        You fall head-first into the water, stunning you momentarily.
When your head clear, you try to swim your way back up to the surface,
only to discover that the exit has been sealed up!  Soon enough, your
lungs feel like they are on fire and about to explode.  Your eyeballs
bulge out of the eyesockets as you try vainly to find air, but you
fail miserably.  Your skeleton will be a nice collection to the
skeletons on the bottom of the pond.

On the Shore of the Sea of Sorrows~

        A bitter wind is blowing in from the sea, and the smell of
rotten fish is especially vile.  You taste bile in your mouth as
you stare out at the broad watery expanse.  The surface of the
water is cloaked in wispy trails of mist so that you cannot see
exactly how far the sea stretches out.

        To your west, there is nothing but thick swampy forest that
does not look too inviting.  You would not be surprised that if
you stepped there, you would be sucked under the mud, so you do
not even think about trying.  A trail leads south, and you can
follow the shore to the east.  A cold bitter wind blows in from
the sea, chilling you to the bone.

shore.  To your east is nothing but a gray wall of mist.  You try
stepping into it, but the mist enters your nostril and lungs,
suffocating you until you step backwards, gagging and choking.
It would seem that you could either go back the way you came, or
step out onto the sea despite the chilly wind and foul odor.

to the east.  To the west, the trail disappears into a dank swampy
forest.  It certainly does not look inviting, and the cloud of
hungry insects hovering over the trail sure look unfriendly.

the walls and sacks of flour and salt sit on top of the barrels.
Some stale-looking bread sits on the counter.  A man wearing colorful
beads stands behind the counter.  He raises his eyebrow at you

is actually nothing more than a simple room with a carpet on the
floor and a bed tucked to the back of the room.  A poster hangs on
a wall with a hand-drawn picture of a fierce-looking shaman.  It
reads "Beware the wrath of Chicken Bone!"  A frail-looking man sits
in the center of the room, meditating and ignoring you.  So.  This
is the cheerful mayor of this dismal place.

You see many small trees along the walls, and one giant tree squarely
in the center of the room.  Thousands of snakes of all different
shapes and sizes hang and slither from branch to branch on the trees.
After watching the slithering bodies with revulsion, you turn your
gaze on the giant tree, and gasp as you see a HUGE python resting
majestically on a branch!  People are standing around the tree,
bowing and worshipping this regal-looking boa.  It stares at you
with an unblinking gaze.

possible.  There are swarms of mosquitoes, fleas, gnats, cockroaches,
centipedes, plus a thousand other species.  You seriously do not
want to tread into that hellish forest.

Those cattails looks awfully tough, so they'd probably wear away any

are slightly visible beneath the surface, although you cannot make
out any details.  Cat tails grow in huge clumps, reducing your vision
and hampering your progress.  You are completely soaked with sweat
and completely hot, yet you do not dare go swimming here.

In a Swampy Dark Forest~

        By now, you are REALLY sick of this damn forest, the
incessant buzzing of the insects, slipping in the mud, and
having your boots constantly full of water and mud.  Grumbling
bitterly, you plod along, while avoiding those eerie swamp
zombies.  To the south, you think you see some sort of a mansion.
Ah at last!  Finally something other than this miserable forest!

In Front of the Plantation Gates~

        The oddest gates you have ever seen looms before you.  It
is made of solid steel.  Looking up, you see spikes and broken
glass lining the top of the plantation walls and you decide not to
think about climbing over THAT.  Suddenly the gate opens a mouth
and speaks, "Feed me."  You stare at it in astonishment.

On the Plantation Grounds~

        You are on the plantation grounds, with the huge mansion doors
to the south.  Looking closer, the building is in fact badly in need
of repair.  Gardeners and workers tend the gardens.  One of them bends
down to pick up. . . an arm?  Before your horrified eyes, he calmly
insert the arm back into his shoulder.  They are not workers, they
are zombie slaves!  What kind of a hideous place is this?!

In the Great Hall~

        You stare around in amazement.  This hall is simply HUGE!
The ceiling soars above you in a majestic arch.  What a pity that
the mansion is in such a sad state of disrepair, it surely was a
beautiful place to live in at one time.  Now dust lay everywhere.
Undead servants mill around aimlessly, and you shiver at the cold 
aura rising from their unliving flesh.

In the Macabre Kitchen~

        This room is beyond belief.  The walls are covered in blood
stains.  The floor is littered with undead flesh and bones.  You
see shrivelled eyeballs floating in jars on the shelves.  The
zombie cook is hacking away at a fresh corpse with a dirty butcher
knife, undoubtedly preparing the next meal.  It is hellishly hot
in here from the giant fire in the oven.  You smell burning flesh
from the oven.  You retch and gag from the combined sight and smell.

In the Decadent Dining Room~

        You stare in wonder in this dining room.  This room is simply
VAST, with a long table stretched out along the middle of the room.
There are many plates set on the table, some of them even has food
on them!  You eagerly reach out for a drumstick, then drop it in
disgust as maggots crawl out from it.  These food must be weeks old!
You catch a whiff of a salad on the table then reel back.  That is
no salad, that is a bowl of mold!

The Formerly Opulent Lounge~

        A worm-eaten grand piano sit in the center of this room.  A
warm fire is blazing away in the fireplace.  Finally some signs of
warmth in this chilly place.  You make your way to the fireplace
and was about to warm yourself when you spot a bone in the fire.
Then you spot a blackened burning skull in the corner.  You cringe
back when you realize that the fireplace is not burning logs, it is
burning corpses.

Climbing the Grand Stairs~

        You climb the once-majestic stairs.  You feel a twinge of
sadness for this decaying castle as you examine the gutted railing.
Old and tattered portraits of long-dead lords hang on the walls.
The stairs creak ominously under your feet, threatening to break
at any time, plunging you into an infinite darkness.

On the Second Floor Hallway~

        Standing on the second floor, zombie servants brush past you
as they perform their mindless duties.  You examine some of the
portraits on the wall here.  Suddenly you gasp.  Did the eyes of
one of the lords just glitter now?  You look closer at the portrait,
but see nothing unusual about it.  Probably just a trick of the 
light.

The Blood-Red Salon~

        Red tapestries line the walls.  Behind the tapestries, the
walls are painted red.  The lush carpet is blood-red, as well as
all the furnitures.  A squawk startles you and you spin around to
see a zombie parrot sitting on a perch.  It too has tufts of red
feathers.  You cant help but feel like you are standing in a pool
of blood in this room. . .

The Master Bedroom of the ZombieLord~

        You stumble into a huge bedroom that must have once been a
lovely room.  You hear some clanking from under the bed, then a
muffled voice calls out, "Is that you, my Lord?"  A zombie crawls
out from underneath, its head hanging from a broken neck.  It
reaches out at you with frayed arms.  You stare into its rotten
eyeballs then you shut your eyes and fight back the bile.  The
thought of zombies copulating is almost too much to bear for your
nauseous stomach.
