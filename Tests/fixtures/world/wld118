     Looking inside, you see a big automatic coffeepot sitting on a counter to
     your right. The aroma of the freshly brewing coffee fills your senses and
     you find yourself rumaging through the cabinets for a mug, sugar, milk, and
     spoon. As you take a sip of the great tasting coffee, you notice that this
     place looks like some sort of meeting room. A large round table with a
     holographic projector sits in the middle of the room and computer screens
     line the walls. This must be where the X-Men plan out a course of action
     when faced with a possible enemy attack.
