{BLUE}The road of destiny{blue}~

     You are heading south on what was once a well-
     maintained road.  It is now little more than a
     pair of wagon wheel ruts holding stagnant water
     and a central knoll of corrupted, greenish black
     grass.

     maintained road.  It is now little more than a
     pair of wagon wheel ruts holding stagnant water
     and a central knoll of corrupted, greenish black
     grass.

     The surrounding countryside is strange, almost
     otherworldly.  The trees have lost most of their
     leaves, or perhaps they never had them.  Mists
     rise from the forest, and the sun seems to have
     lost its warmth.  A definite chill lingers in
     the air.

     rise from the forest, and the sun seems to have

     the air.

     Suddenly, creatures leap at you from the ground,
     dead trees, the dusty rocks.  They attack you
     nipping with eroded but still sharp teeth.  
     Perhaps they were once squirrels or stoats.
     Their long tails retain a few bristled patches,
     their mangy body hair hangs in sparse clumps
     on their lumpy frames.

     Heading farther south the countryside remains in ruin.
     A huge flock of hideous butterflies beating stumpy wings
     dive at you squirming through holes and openings in your
     clothing and armor.  The butterflies are a sickly shade of 
     white with large knobby antennae and long black tongues
     that dart in and out of their almost human lips.

     Now a third menace comes at you, from the sky.  Creatures
     the color of mud, they appear to be humanoid, although
     malformed with distended bellies and uneven, mismatched
     limbs and wings.  Each is 52 to 56 inches long and has a
     set of dirty ivory horns protruding from its head.

{BLUE}Approaching the castle{blue}~

     The approach to the castle looks almost as if one of the
     southern deserts had been defiled and then transplanted
     here.  The barren, sandy ground holds no life, though a
     few thin, dead trunks that once belonged to trees struggle
     to show a presence.

{WHITE}Castle Spulzeer{white}~

     The moat, long since dried, is coated in places with a 
     slimy green growth of uncertain origin.  The drawbridge
     sits permanently fixed in its lowered position, and it
     appears not quite safe for wagons, or creatures larger
     than human size.

     The castle itself has started to crumble.  The south tower
     lies partially collapsed, leaving a remnant that looks
     like a giant fang.  Some of the windows are broken,
     letting the chill, damp weather into the castle.

     A high screech, joined by another, breaks the unnatural
     silence.  The sound comes from above, where two wyverns
     strain against chains that hold them to the roof gables.
     The chains break, and down they plunge - straight for you.

{WHITE}By the entrance{white}~

     You stand before the doors to the castle.  The massive
     oak slabs are not secured, for the locks have long since
     rusted and the keys are lost to time.  One door looks
     slightly ajar, as if an invitation...

     A long decaying garden lies to the north.  Its gate is
     pulled shut.

{BLACK}The decaying garden{black}~

     This walled terrace, once a peaceful refuge, now seems a
     nightmare.  Stunted black roses survive at the tops of
     withered, long-dead stems.  Brambles cover the dead 
     grounds like a grotesque carpet.  Where once the sunlight
     danced across the crenelations of the ivy-sheathed walls,
     now mists hide decomposing masonry, and alien images 
     dance in the haze.

{RED}Heart of the garden{red}~

     You have found your way into the heart of the garden.
     Strangely, the garden's heart is teeming with flowers,
     shrubs, and vines of every description.  A variety of
     sweet odors perfume the air, some so delicate that they
     pass almost unnoticed, others cloying and overwhelming.
     Tiny bees move about, apparently uninterested in you as
     they go about their labors.

     A sudden movement catches your eye.  Just ahead, through
     a tangle of vines spotted with delicate indigo blossoms,
     you notice the slender silhouette of a beautiful woman.
     The instant that your gaze touches her slendor shadow,
     any thought of leaving this garden vanishes.

{WHITE}The great hall{white}~

     You have gained entry to the ground floor of the castle.
     This is no ordinary keep, now or at any time.  Yes,
     weapons and shields adorn the walls, but though they 
     once boasted courage, heroism, and life, in their 
     tarnished state they now seem to represent cowardice,
     dishonor, and death.

     From where you stand, entrance at your back, you can see
     that once this was a great estate.  You are in the great
     hall, which has a ceiling almost 20 feet high.  The hall
     continues east.

     You stand in the great hall.  Four huge fireplaces rest
     at cardinal points of this massive room.  Doors in the
     distance lead to other locations of the floor.  At the
     center of the room is a wide, twisting staircase that
     spirals to the floor above.

     The ghostly image of a woman stands on the upper part of
     the staircase.  Her arm reaches out to you, her hand
     beckoning you to follow as she gently drifts higher up
     the stairs, disappearing from your sight.

     You stand on the floor of what appears to be an unusual
     library.  The room itself is no more than a wide hallway
     section strecthing out of sight.  Shelves of leather-
     bound books line both walls.  From where you stand, there
     seems to be no end to this collection of unusual volumes.

     The ceiling of this library is some ten feet above the
     floor. It appears to be nothing more than a brilliant
     white light which throws its harsh glare across all
     below.  Looking at this light, even indirectly, proves

{WHITE}The study{white}~

     There is little order here.  Chairs sit scattered, left
     where they were when the last user pushed himself away.
     Many books rest on shelves, mixed with ancient accounting
     records and travel journals of Spellseers who journeyed
     abroad.  Among the books a few stand out.  History of the
     Spellseers, Spulzeer and a guide of some sorts regarding
     the undead.

     Suddenly a crash sounds behind you.  In the doorway stands
     a disheveled man with a wild look in his eyes.  His 
     uncombed hair sticks up at odd angles, and he looks as
     if he has slept in his clothes for weeks.  He carries a
     great broadsword that he seems only too willing to use.

     With a wordless scream he charges you, sword raised high.
     Before he reaches you he stops.  He shakes his head in
     bewilderment and begins to mutter something you can not
     quite make out.

history~

     This book tells much of the ancient Spellseers.  It covers
     everthing from the bloodline of family magic-users to the
     Year of the Whistling Wind.  In that year the Spellseer
     house came to a fall.  As the castle prospered in fortune
     and grew to have good ties with the royal family of Amn,
     other rich families became envious of them.  Eventually
     envy lead to the forgery of documents implementing the
     Spellseers as using their magical abilities to an unfair
     advantage over their trading partners.  In the time that
     followed the royal family turned against the Spellseers,
     along with many of the lands merchants.  The Spellseers
     had fallen.

Spulzeer~

     The Spulseers..
     In the year 838, a youthful but wise Spellseer patriarch,
     Tregas II, changed the family name to "Spulzeer" in an
     attempt to restore the good name and profits of the clan.
     He instituted other reforms, dropped a cloak of total
     secrecy around the family's magical practices, and curried
     favor with the King of Amn by loaning money to the crown
     at no interest.  His plan was successful, and by 900DR,
     Spulzeer was a family to be reckoned with.  "Spellseer"
     was beginning to be forgotten.

{WHITE}The balcony staircase{white}~

     This room contains a large stone staircase between rough
     masonry walls.  The room is relatively free of obstruction
     and there is little dust on the steps.  A cool dampness
     flows in from the outside balcony above.  The wind howls
     over the balcony and down through the staircase forcing
     you to squint from the sand and debris.

{BOLD,WHITE}The balcony's end{bold,white}~

     As you reach the end of the balcony something strange 
     happens.  The melodious music that seems to have lead
     you here stops allowing space for a deadly silence...

     Then the sudden cry of a hunting bird echoes through
     your mind.  Shrill and piercing, it rings in your ears
     long after it has ceased.

     Looking into the sky, you see a horrific sight.  Swooping
     down out of the expanse of the horizon is a creature with
     the wings and talons of a bird yet having the body of a
     ravishingly beautiful woman.  Her hungry eyes seem to 
     lock with yours as she licks her snarling lips.

     With another strident cry, she plunges into a dive, her
     talons outstretched.

{YELLOW}Dinning Hall{yellow}~

     Semi-transparent feasters sit at round tables
     everywhere you look, soundlessly pounding the
     tables with fists, knives, and two-pronged forks.
     Three ghostly, shuffling elves, covered only by
     expensive cloaks, are prodded forward.  A half-
     giant, butcher knife and carving cutlery in hand,
     stands passively behind a pair of arm and leg
     stocks mounted on a large table.

     The first elf, a young male, is lead to the stand
     without struggle, his eyes glazed.  He is pushed
     into the stocks, which are then closed around his
     ankles and wrists.  The butcher sets to work as
     spectral waiters stand ready with platters for
     the main course.  The image fades, then begins
     again.

{BOLD,WHITE}The lands of Amn{bold,white}~

     Some claim that the fall of Spellseer was preordained,
     that the land upon which the castle was built was cursed,
     and many chilling tales were told around campfires, 
     stories of why this was so.  Some sages say that the
     Spellseers themselves were cursed by elves or others who
     claimed the land occupied by the great Castle.  In Amn
     they have a saying, "investments yield the profits they
     have earned," and they say the Spellseers' fall as 
     proper return for the venture.  The truth, as it usually
     does, probably contains elements of all these theories.

     ahead.  A ghostly figure, well dressed but obscure, 
     creeps into the room.  He steals softly to the bed and
     lifts the sleeping woman over his shoulder.

     Your surroundings appear to change, as the figure moves
     through different parts of the castle while you remain
     in place.

     The man grabs the woman roughly, pushing her ahead of
     him and into the dusk beyond mighty doors.  He ties the
     woman to a chair.

     With a large dagger bearing a red gemstone in its hilt
     he slits her throat.  Her blood gushes down her white
     robes pooling onto the floor.  With the dreadful act
     consumated, he drops the knife to the floor as she falls
     to the ground.

     Above her hand, an image forms.  It is the ornate silver
     knife used to kill her.  It rotates slowly, then stops,
     its hilt pointing toward you.

     "You must get the knife, take it then to the castle's
     highest floor.  There you may have passage to destroy
     the creature that has caused this evil...."  with that
     the figure fades into nothingness.

{RED}The Spellseer library{red}~

     You stand on the floor of what appears to be an unusual
     library.  Shelves of leather-bound books line each wall.
     From where you stand there seems to be no end to this
     collection of unusual volumes.

     The ceiling is some ten feet above the floor.  It appears
     to be nothing more than a brilliant white light which
     throws its harsh glare across everything below.  Looking
     at this light, even indirectly, proves painful.

{BOLD,BLUE}The Master Hallway{bold,blue}~

     As you enter this hall, your lights make eerie,
     dancing shadows on figures standing against the
     walls.  Before you can react, you relize they are
     statues, garbed and equiped in unusual, archaic
     styles.

{CYAN}The guest hall{cyan}~

     Frescoes cover the ceiling in brilliant detail. 
     Aging banners hang stiffly from the rafters.
     Statues of ancient Knights are found along the
     walls in the hall, while scenes of their battles
     are immortalized overhead.

{G}The Roof{g}~

     You stand atop Castle Spulzeer.  The land below remains
     barren and decaying still.  The now night sky seems to
     dominate your surroundings and the silence here seems
     to be almost supernatural.

     The silence breaks as your attention comes to a low hum
     originating from over the castles north wall.  Upon
     investigation you spot a strange, two dimensional portal.
     It seems to hang in the air as if supported by unseen
     ground.

{CYAN}Into the Portal{cyan}~

     As you walk onto the shining surface of the portal the
     images of strange shapes and colors begin to swirl and
     mesh below you.  The images bend and turn and begin to
     take shape.  Finally the scene comes to a solid state.
     You now stand above a city stretching in all directions.
     People move about, in and out of buildings, conversing
     and carrying out their daily duties.

     Suddenly the image ripples as it turns to a dry liquid.
     You fall slowly tumbling in all directions.

{Y}On the Tethir Road{y}~

     The Tethir Road was built thousands of years ago and still
     remains one of the best highways in the lands of Amn.
     The road divides the outside lands of Amn from the lands
     of Tethyr.  The road is in good repair and often time is
     patrolled by the Amnian military.

     In the distance a large city comes into view.

{CY}Shaundakul's Tavern{cy}~

     The tavern is a comfortable, well-appointed roadhouse
     that serves what is reputed to be the best rabbit stew
     in all the lands.  The name of the place is derived from
     the lodestone slab that serves as the counter top for the
     bar.  It is said to have come from a ruined temple of the
     god of caravans.  The food quality here is good, and the
     prices are low enough to appeal to caravan drivers and 
     officers of the guard as well.
