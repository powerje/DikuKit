{G,BO}Entrance to Talenifor{b}~

{G}  Walking out of your materializer, the very setting of all around you
{G}  appears centuries older, pre-dating to the medieval era. The office
{G}  around you is lavish, filled with dozens of trinkets and beautiful
{G}  heirlooms belonging to those of noble hierarchy. Several guards
{G}  protect the entrance to their city, alongside the Ambassador while
{G}  he is in office. Double doors rest at your north, the respective
{G}  guards refusing to open them until fealty is sworn.{b}

Icky... that's the first thought that crosses your mind as you
enter this room. This place is a mess, and it doesn't help matters
that everything is on fire! My goodness... the only thing that's
not on fire is his bed and his sofa.

As you look around here, you tend to notice a smell that's not
smoke, instead it smells like rotten milk. It's probably from
the refridgerator. Oh well, tell him to clean it up. There are
also a bunch of porno magazines lying around, but you don't wanna
know what this guy does while reading them. You realize you better
get your ass out of here if he sees you here uninvited.

This seems to be an old laboratory, but now everything
is empty. The person that used to live here used to test
things out all the time. A small notebook is all that's left in this empty room.

A couple of torn out pages also lie the floor.

A half torn page reads...

Decided to experiment, making Sailor Moon mobs with a few extra dummies
in 178. Hmm... I could possibly make a Sailor Moon zone while waiting
for Prom night to open.

There seems to be a page stuck underneath it, you tear it
out and it reads....

Sailor Moon is finally done! I made Sailor Moon to be the best
possible damn zone I could ever make it... I'm sure a
lot of morts will enjoy it....

A scribble at the bottom reads....

Damn..... I can't believe the mortals won't go do my zones
anymore... Prom Night bombed and I had to close it... Sailor
Moon didn't do as well as I hoped... I've run out of inspiration.
it's not worth it if no one does any of my zones....

And that's all you see..
~
E
notebook~
This notebook seems awfully wet, but you can make out just a few
pages....

One page reads...

Ok..... how can I figure out how to do this zone.... I want to
try and make it as close as I can to the town of Narshe in
FFIII. I want to make some of the more important characters
right now, and maybe someday I'll add it on.

Another page reads.

Man I'm on a roll here! I just have enough rooms left to do
another zone, or at least start it up... man if only I had
the inspiration... I know! Ranma 1/2! That sounds like a pretty
good zone to make...

Yet another page...
Hmm... Ranma is supposed to be superior to Ryoga.. Ryoga has
killed Ranma several times in demonstrations.... I gotta figure
out how to make them different enough...

Another page....

I haven't created a zone in awhile.... I guess I could do one
on my high school memories... Maybe a satire on different things...
what could I do?

A half torn page reads...

On the stairs~
Now you climb a small stairway leading up to a hallway. 
As you climb the stairs, you notice a strange feeling.
One thing you notice about these stairs, is how sturdy
they are. They can hold a lot of weight. The stairway continues
upward.

On the stairs~
Now you climb a small stairway leading up to a hallway. 
As you climb the stairs, you notice a strange feeling.
Your climb is interuppted, however, by a man who is sitting at
the top of the stairs. He doesn't seem very friendly, and
as he stands you notice that he's a cyborg. A big and mean one
at that.

The Hallway~
You make it to the top of the stairs, and find yourself in a small,
cramped hallway. There are other doors you see in the hallway, but they
don't work, no matter what. Up ahead you see one door that is slightly
open, and hear a lot of odd sounds coming from that direction.

The bedroom.~
You've finally made it to the end. You've entered a strange bedroom,
and it looks like it's falling apart. There is an odd figure sitting
in the room. He turns his head, and you see blood pouring from the man's
head. He stands up, his wrists seem like they have something tied to
them. He snarls at you, sending a chill up and down your spine. 
It looks like this man doesn't want you to escape, and you'll
have to kill him before you can.
