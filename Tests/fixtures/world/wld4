{BO,R} Broca Beach {bo,r}~

   The Hovercraft brings you up to shore a few miles northeast of the town and
   turns to return home.  Day gives way to night in the sky above as you wade up
   to the sandy beach.  You see the sand stretching north and south for miles 
   while the orange and burgundy rays flashing from the setting sun bounce off 
   the waters creating a deep blood red shimmer that ripples through the waves.
   It's a breathtakingly tranquil sight as you stop to gaze at the water and 
   sky.  With a shrug you shoulder your pack, check your weapons and gear and
   begin to cover the tracks you've made.  To the south the beach stretches on
   for as far as the eye can see, while to the east lies your path to the town 
   of Broca.  Here is where you decide, a stroll on the beach or will you begin
   the eastward march towards your goal?

{Y}Path to town{y}~

   After a mile or two of steady marching your path veers off towards a
   more southeastern direction taking you to the brink of the small forest
   looming up ahead.  The forest is the last barrier between you and the town.
   As you creep your way through you notice an eerie silence, the very air 
   seems deathly calm and all around you hear not a buzz of insect or rustle
   of leaf.  You move on and finally come to the far edge of trees where, at
   first glance down into the town below you see no activity, it looks almost
   as if it has been deserted.  As you make your way closer to the town you
   begin to notice signs of life and see movement on the streets and windows 
   below.

Arbco road~

   You stand on the beginnings of Arbco Road, the main street in Broca Beach
   which leads straight through the small town.  To the north lies the eerie 
   woods surrounding the town while the road south leads to the town itself.
   Now that you have reached the outskirts of town you notice quite a bit of 
   activity.  People are lining the streets, slowly shambling from one place 
   to another in some trance-like state, apparently oblivious to the world 
   around them.

{W}Ticket Booth{w}~

You move closer to the building and discover it is a HUGE factory.  So this
is the Arbco factory that this town is apparently known for.  Well it 
certainly looks gloomy, and.....scary?  You peer even closer and realize 
that the factory is closed with a set of giant doubledoors with a chain 
lock thicker than your waist.  This may be a dangerous place but thats 
where the party is.  You don't wanna miss the party do ya??

{BLU}The Rooftop Escape{blu}~

   Up from the smoky gloom you climb, to reach the relative safety of the
   rooftops above the maze of alleys.  A large skylight can be seen to the
   south, emitting a dim glow.  With a glance back down into the alleys, you
   turn and make your way to the skylight, glad to be rid of the misty shroud
   that harboured the deadly lurking Ninja.

Merc street~

With your decision made, you head off into the gloomy shadows of Merc 
street.  Once on the road you question yourself, thinking this may not have
been such a bright idea.  Too late for regrets now.  You near the end of 
the street without once seeing the slightest signs of life other than the 
rats and spiders scurrying about.  The street ends abruptly and you stand
before a narrow alley leading into darkness.

{BLU}Through the Skylight{blu}~

   Looking down through the skylight you notice people milling about and
   standing in lines.  The place appears to be a movie theater, complete
   with snack bar and ticket booths.  There doesn't appear to be any {BO,BLU}C{BO,R}o{BO,BLU}b{BO,R}r{BO,BLU}a{bo,blu} 
   agents around to further hinder your recon patrol, however the only 
   visible access to the theater is the skylight, or down the ladder and
   back through the maze of alleys.  A latch on the inside of the window 
   would release the lock and allow you entrance to the theater, if you 
   could get something in there to push it aside.

You step up to the front desk and notice the dust piled high everywhere.
There is no one here to give you a lane or shoes, and it appears there 
hasn't been for quite a while.  Looks like bowling wasn't too popular 
around here.   To the south there are Video games and pool tables and more 
lanes.  What a shame, a round of bowling would have been nice. Oh well, 
guess you'll have to find something else to do!

{B}A Rip in the Screen{b}~


Here its is the same as everywhere, dust piled high on all the games,
tables and lanes.  You wonder why they don't just tear it down and make
something useful out of the space!  As you wander around, looking at the
surroundings in puzzlement, you notice footprints leading down lane 12.
This is the only sign of life in this entire building and it looks pretty
recent.

You are standing right in the middle of the last lane in the now shut-down Arbco Bowling Alley.  The secret doorway to the alley lies behind you.  Inside the bowling alley you see signs of current use and hear noises coming from behind the pins, to the east of you.  To the west is the front doors, now locked and barred, and the front desk.  It appears empty, but there is no harm in checking, just to be on the safe side.

Well it shouldn't be to hard to find a door when everytnig is covered in dust except the floor where the prints lead east!

   Your eyes slowly refocus and adjust to a normal degree of light and you notice 
   you are in a labratory of some sort.  Files and vials cover the counters 
   and floors, while computers line the entire room.  This room is full of 
   hi-tech hardware and hi-tech guards.  Swarming with Techno Vipers who 
   appear to be rather heavily guarding a door on the far side of the room, 
   it all seems very out-of-place in a small town like Broca Beach.  What  
   kind of technology is {BO,BLU}C{BO,R}o{BO,BLU}b{BO,R}r{BO,BLU}a{bo,blu} researching?

   You try grabbing some files but the constant barrage of attacks keeps

   to discover exactly what it is {BO,BLU}C{BO,R}o{BO,BLU}b{BO,R}r{BO,BLU}a{bo,r} is doing in this town.  In the meantime

   another charge of Techno Vipers fly your way.

   The sights and sounds surround you in flash, crashing in on you like a wave 
   beating itself in on the shore.  Grinning faces flit by in a blinding, nearly
   unrecognizable blur while the din of laughter, the buzzing and beeping of
   games, the roar of rides and the blaring music assault your ears.  You hear
   the game attendants howling for your attention while the overpowering smells

The {BO,Y}Trap{bo,y} is sprung!~
So you have finally made it to the center of the maddness and the source of the smell.  Why do you look so disappointed?? Is it because you realize it is a trap and that vat of goop in front of you is the concoction that brought you here and not the smell of candy??  Or perhaps you are disappointed to see both Zarana and her dim-witted protector beside her?  Well it doesn't matter much why you are upset, all that matters is that the big brute Roadpig doesn't make you 'roadkill'!!

{C}Haven {M}of {C}Peace{c}~

   Inside, the cottage is sparsely furnished with only a table, a few chairs
   and a long soft couch which sits in front of the fireplace.  A bearskin 
   rug lies cozily before the soft fire.  As soon as you enter this room you
   are filled with an aura of peace, and the warmth seems to penetrate deep
   inside your very bones.  You feel revitalized almost instantly, and know
   that this place offers complete protection for you and your party.

house you look about at your surroundings.  You can't seem to see anything
more than a few feet in front of you even with the sunlight streaming
through the broken door.  An archway is barely recognizable through the
impenetrable darkness leading north deeper into the gaping jaws of night.

   The patio offers an enchanting view of the sea and the surrounding beach.
   With the warm glow of candlelight seeping out of the open door and windows
   of the cottage behind, it offers a warm peaceful ambience to the charming

   warmth, protection and a place to rest and relax.

You snap out of your daydream to notice that there is a lake just to the northeast of you.  You see a beach on the southside of the lake but have no idea how to get to it.  There is, however, a trail leading north to a small cliff which ends at the lake.  Maybe you could dive off that cliff into the lake, since you can't go any other way, unless you want to hack through dense forest.

   night totally envelops the last fading rays of light.  You are surrounded
   by the peaceful sounds of the waves lapping against the shore and the

{BLU}A Large Waterfall{blu}~
You have come to the source of the roar, a large, beautiful waterfall.  You 
peer over the edge and see the mist floating back up towards you.  With a sigh of utter contentment you realize fully the beauty of Mother nature.  Freedom and immortality seem almost within your grasp in this haven of the gods, which is what this wonderous place must be!  What would happen if i were to throw myself into the roaring waves below, you think to yourself with a grin.  However after a  serious two second debate with yourself, you realize that MAY be a bad idea.  Even if you survived the drop, would the water below be deep enough to stop your descent before smashing through the rocks jutting out from the water?  The only way to find out is to try it. Now if only you had something to slow your descent once you hit the water.....

You turn and rest on the desk catching your breath.  With an eerie feeling, like you are being watched, your gaze is slowly pulled up to a sight of big black boots, then long muscular legs all the way up to powerful, broad shoulders.  Resting on top of this formidable specimen are the handsome features of a face covered by a bright, gleaming silver mask!!  Your eyes pop wide open as you realize that you have barricaded yourself in with Destro, one of the most dangerous men alive!!!!  You start to sweat as you watch Destro standing there firmly, showing no sign of surprise or fear.  In fact you get the feeling that he is laughing at you behind that mask.  Man don't you feel dumb now!!

Good thing you didn't land on that pair of scissors right next to you,  or that sharp looking spike protruding from the ground!!   You get up and dust of your clothes and search for a way out!  As you glance south you notice and exit and perhaps a way out!! Then again perhaps it isn't?!?

You notice the stairs are a little worn out and wonder whether it is safe to climb or not.  You have little choice however because this is the only exit you can find in this basement.  Do you dare to ascend the stairs??

You step up the ladder leading to the upper offices of the factory, having absolutlely no idea what to expect. The one thing you can probably rely on though, is that no good will come from going up here, but hopefully its not as bad as being slowly killed by a rushing mob.  You slowly make your way up, hearing the crashing and banging on your barricaded door, and open the hatch at the top of the ladder.  As you peek your head through you notice the room looks empty, therefore relatively safe.......for now!!

A gap in the shimmering, fluctuating walls appears here, but it is too small for anything to fit through.  If only there were a way to make the break a little larger!

You open the hatch fully and pull yourself through.  As your feet settle on the floor you hear the crash of the hatch closing and you turn about quickly.  Well at least no one was in front of the hatch!!!  Behind you, barring your way out the door to the west, AND the hatch below, are several B.A.T.s standing protectively in front of Cobra Commander himself.

You walk through the halls of the upper ofices, following the B.A.T.s and Cobra Commander.  If only you can get your hands on Cobra Commander, maybe you can ransom your way out of here.  So you steadily work to close him in, knowing these halls have to end sooner or later.

You have come to the end of the hall and only one offices lies ahead of you.  Once you push the Commander and his B.A.T.s in here, there is no escape, at least you hope not.  It seems like this cowardly Cobra always finds a way to retreat.  But hopefully if you can get him there you can stop him once and for all.  Here's your chance, show them what you're made of!

You step into the lavish office, decorated with all sorts of art pieces and the most comfortable furniture you have ever seen.  The only blemish in the entire office are the ones standing in front of you.  So here you stand face to face with the Cobra Commander and his remaining B.A.T.s, with no means of escape for either of you.  Here is the last showdown, and only one of you will be walking away from this one.  You better make sure it's you walking away, cause a rescue mission in here is only for the suicidal and the crazy.

Here lies yet another break in the fabrics of your mind.  Yet this one seems slightly different.  It is already wide enough for you to enter, however through the gap all you can see is pitch.  It almost seems as if the dark inside has sucked away absolutely all form of light, and is pulsating from the gap, eager to feed.

   A hatch opens up in the floor with stairs taking you down into a musty, dark
   tunnel, lit every so often with a dim bulb.  The air starts to buzz and the
   ground quakes, as out of nowhere a large underground rail train hammers 
   into the station with a deafening scream.  Screeching to halt, the train 
   doors open and light floods the tunnel from inside the train.  First and
   last stop, the streets below the Cobra consulate building.  This train will
   take you to the newstand, a secret {BO,G}Joe{bo,g} surveillance base, across from
   the consulate building. From there you're on your own.
