that they are made out of solid gold!

{C}Northern Road{c}~
{R}Even though the castle seems huge at first the roads are not that
lengthy.  Infact you can see the castle exist comming up shortly.
To the east you see a magic shop and to the west is a nice little hut.

{C}Eastward Road{c}~
{R}Hmm this road is no longer the mundane dirt road.  It seems that
this one has been laid with brick and stone.  In the far distance you
see the King's dwelling.  The building is made out of massive stones
of marble.  Many hours must have been taken up to build this massive
structure.{r}

{R}Wow, this place is huge.  There is no other rooms but the one that leads
North into the King's Throne room, this room is so massive that it
contains all his living conditions.  And in the middle of the room
is a huge round table like king arthur's in camelot.

{C}King's {Y}Throne Room{y}~
{R}Quite inpressive room to be in.  The King is sitting in his thrown
as usual, but what is different is that his beautiful princess is 
missing.  Perhaps she's changing at the moment, but anyhow you must
concentrate on what they king has to say!  He looks rather upset
perhaps you should SAY somthing like "what is your bidding?"{r}

the walls surrounding the area have scuff marks all over them as if
someone has been practicing for a war around here.{r}

stands an extremely battered wooden doll in which warriors practice upon.{r}

{R}Oh my, its the last surviving crusader, Gabriel's hut glows with
wisdom and power.  He has been on many quests throughout his life and
now he wanders the streets of Miggarrad helping out future warriors.
Many say that he has been blessed by God as he has survived so many fights
and seen so many places.  Alas, Gabriel isn't here to greet you, but in
his place you see a week plundering hermit.{r}
