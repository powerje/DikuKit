You get a bad feeling looking in that direction!~
OH NO!!!!!!  You hit a death trap and have died and lost all your eq!!!!!

Fortunately, this was a practice DT  (as we like to call Death Traps)
and you haven't really died and lost all your equipment.  However,
consider this as a learning experience.  From now on, if you're
able to, make sure to PEEK in the direction you want to go before
moving in that direction.  PEEK is a thief-only skill and if you're
not a thief, then it is recommended that you group with a thief until
you reach avatar level.

If you hit a real DT in the future, then make sure to complete the
Time Quest!  The Time Quest is where you can recover at least
*SOME* of your eq, but not all of them.  Be sure to ask any
other mortal online who may know and help you with the Time
Quest.

Now, recall out of this room and try again, and be sure to avoid
this room next time!

realize several things:  the altar is covered with thick dark blood, there's
a naked woman with stark terror in her eyes all tied up and laid on top
of it, and there's a red-robed man wearing a goat's mask raising a
jewelled dagger, ready to plunge it down into her heart.  All around you,
the villagers continue their incessant chanting...

doors line both walls of this hall, and you can see forlorn-looking
people staring at you hopelessly, while a huge brutal jailor

In the Pews~
     You see some people standing here, ignoring the wooden pews that
offer a seat.  All of them have a glazed look in their eyes and their
mouths murmur soft chanting words that send a chill up your spine! 
Looking around, you recognize Filthy, the Bartender, the Wizard, and the
guildmasters all staring vacantly at the altar ahead.  They don't even seem
aware of you...

Las Vegas Wedding Chapel~
     You stare around in this chapel with a mixed feeling of awe and
humbleness.  With great arched ceiling and painted windows, this
sure is a lovely spot for a wedding!  There is an altar with a solemn
looking priest standing behind it, reciting from an old beaten
up bible.  You hear crunching sounds behind you and you turn around
to see that the wedding guests are eating popcorns and passing
soft drinks to each other.  The priest frowns as a hairy-looking guy
belches loudly.  Far in the distance you can hear a commotion of
people gambling in a casino and you feel a twinge of envy
for them having fun.  Ditzy bridesmaid are weeping uncontrollably
and faint as Gara and Rowan passionately kiss each other while
ignoring the babbling priest.

The fissure under the ledge~
  This is a small fissure in the solid rock. Under you lies the deep dark pool.
The water trickles quietly down from the ledge above you. The water smells 
like the water in a sewer.
