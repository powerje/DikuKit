{BLUE}{BO}Inside the City of Dragonnia{blue}{bo}~
   
  {C,BO}You think that you have already gone too far, unfortunately, 
  it is too late. The hole is too high and far too slippery to 
  be climbed. 
  
  There are two roads, one to the west and another to the east. 
  To the north you feel an awesome heat, and sweat rolls down 
  your brow as you face that direction.

cascade down from the heavens and fill you with a sense of power and
pride. The hole starts to shift, to change. You begin to notice a small
figure in the middle of the vortex. She smiles at you and beckons you
onward with your journey.

Beneath the Sun~
   You are standing before a great ocean that stretches as far as the
eye can see. Seagulls fly far overhead. The sun seems to cover the bright
blue sky entirely. The warm wind makes it very hot and very stuffy.

The Seat of Law~
   The great domed ceiling looms far overhead. Row upon row of oaken
desks line this fantastic hall. A huge portrait of Tapis has been hung
upon the far eastern wall - red silk ribbons are adourning it. The
sweet fragrance of lilacs fills the room and makes you feel quite at
home.

The Small Hill~
   You stand at the peek of a small hill in the middle of a golden plain.
Large wheat stalks wave in the gentle breeze and fill you with an inner
peace. The large billowy clouds cast shadows across the plain, which creates
a cool breeze.

The Cell~
   A series of small shadows is cast across you face. You have stumbled
into a small cell that is pitch as night. You notice the faint outline
of a small cot along the back wall, with a ceramic urinal beside it.
A stained mirror hangs over a sink with flowing water. The putrid stench
of sweat fills you with dread, and the soft crying of another inmate
sends chills down you spin.

Before the Light~
   You cannot move. Leather straps bound your arms and legs. A large
steel mask has been placed over your head, making it impossible for
for you to speak. A large light shines far overhead, casting dark
shadows across the small chamber. The clinking of tools can be heard
behind you, and the constant churning of a grinstone can be heard in
the distance.

Under the Sea~
   You seem to be standing upon a large bed of corral beneath a great
ocean. Large fish swim all about you, causing you to sway with the current.
a large seashell, with a great pearl inside, can be seen in the distance.
Above you see a large boat sailing across the open seas.

The Face~

the current time in the world of the Northern Crossroads. The constant
"Tick-Tock" of the clock is almost deafening, and you feel a headache
start to overtake you.

The trail in the Forest~
   You are standing on a huge path that leads down the middle of a small
forest. All about you can be heard the scampering of the small forest
animals. The thick foliage overhead casts a cool shadow, and makes your
journey somewhat peaceful. As you turn a corner you notice a small cottage
to one side of the path. A large plume of smoke softly rises from its
stone chimney.

The Library~
   A large cherry desk stands before you. Each wall is blanketed with
large oaken shelves lined with leather bound books. To the farthest
northern corner stands a pedestal with the most magnificant dictionary
ever compiled. Students, or what appear to be students, are seated
around the great desk.

The Waiting Room of the Gods ~
   You seem to be seated on a small bench in a very dark room. You can
see a faint light eminating from a room to the south, but that is all
that you can clearly see. As you stand to get up you suddenly notice that
your legs have been shackled to the Onyx bench. A loud scream erupts
the chamber as a cold hand runs down your arm...

Withen the Tube~
   You are standing in a long, round, white tube. Its sides are as smooth
as the finest silk. As you look back and forward you notice that the tube
seems to stretch on forever. A small stream is running down the length
of the tube, and seems to be staining its walls.

The Sandy Dunes of Death~
   You find yourself crawling upon your hands and knees. The bright, hot
sun beats down on your frail body relentlessly. Your lips are sour and
cracked. Your clothes are ripped and shredded beyond belief. To the
distance you notice a small oasis in the middle of this parched land
and hope fills your being.

The Cobblestone Road~
   Your hard foot falls make a strange echo off of the cobblestone. Small
buildings surround you on all sides as claustrophobia grips your soul.
A old man, pushing a cart of corpses, can be seen to the north. You jump
in fright as a rat scurries out from a crack in the wall to the east.
The wind here is hot, and unforgiving, making you wish you never entered
this wasted realm.

The mist slowly cascades down your body and small goosepimples start 
to show on your skin.

seen penetrating the skin of the wicked potion. The hags stare at you
as you enter there realm. A small smile crosses one of there faces as
you approach...

   You stand before a pair of old and withered gates. A large stone wall
runs from east to west while a small castle can be seen past the gates.
The land here seems to chift and change with time. From second to
second you notice that the land shifts from solid to mush. Colors change,
and all is in total chaos.

   You suddenly realize that you must have stepped into a small vortex.
Behind you stands the small castle of Tapis, but all around you are
small thorn bushes that block your way. You start to ponder, and notice
a small, virtually hidden path that leads back to the west.

Beneath the Rose Bush in the Tapestry~
   You find yourself crawling beneath a small rose bush. The ground here
is moist and soft. The thick foliage of the bush destroys all hope of
light ever reaching this small, hidden path. The thick fragrance of the
bush fills your mind with thoughts of love and hope. You then notice a
small hole in the wall. The hole appears to be able ti fit one person
quite comfortalbly...
A LARGE sign has been drawn into the moist earth.

to have been carved out of the black wall.
