  This narrow little forest road is covered in
  wildlife.  Quick growing vines obscure the
  path below you, making travelling deeper into
  the forest more difficult.  Birds, deer, and

  The tall oaks and cedars of the forest bear thick
  vines and fungi of orange, green and blue.  Rodents 
  are abundant here.  Mice play by day and hide from 
  the great owl at night.  Opossum tend to their young 
  and squirrels scamper about the forest trees. Leaves  
  from above provide shelter and hold in the warmth.

  The crevices between the gray and earthen stone  
  harbour soft moss. The center of the bridge  
  has been worn away from years of heavy travel  
  though now the road is travelled less. On either  
  side of the bridge, great ferns and wildflowers have 
  taken root in the stagnant streambed.  Small golden  
  finches hop along the edge of the trail up ahead  
  while a serpent sits coiled on a low hanging  
  willow branch.

  The flatlands directly outside the great forest
  to the east stretch for many miles into the

  The sweet smell of pollen fills the air as a
  breeze gently blows across the valley.  Long
  native grasses bend slightly in the wind,
  lightly brushing upon one another.  Small farms
  and cottages dot the surrounding landscape,
  with wide tracts of untouched land between each
  of them.  To the east, the vast stretches of
  great forest looms in the distance.  The road

  A few small farms line the road directly outside
  the small town of Wellington.  These farms are
  well irrigated by ditches running alongside their
  fields, which also appear to attract both birds
  and bugs.  The valley air is constantly filled
  with the sounds of life.  Bugs, birds, and other

  The Hermanthaya River's rapids ease up as
  the bottom of the river levels out. The river
  flows directly south towards the forest trail.
  As the land to the south is less hilly, the 
  river flows more gently and at some point meets
  up with Haishi Lake.

  Turning off the main trail to explore
  what might be in this direction, there
  is a path that leads down beneath an old
  bridge into a riverbed. Since the riverbed 
  isn't very visible from here, it might be 
  a good idea to go north and check it out.

  Deep in the forest, the light shines through
  the trees just enough to reveal an old bridge. 
  Beneath the bridge is a bit of shallow water
  that swarms with bugs. Not a very attractive 
  place to visit, but where does that trail lead?

  Moss and lichen cling to the stone that

  Darkness lingers under the old bridge.
  Everything is still, including the small
  pool of water which does nothing but 
  reek a foul stench. Hundreds of small,
  disgusting insects have made the old
  riverbed home. The river has dried to
  nearly nothing and ferns now grow where
  the river once flowed. This is not a 
  place many stay for long.

  The granite stones stand taller than

  The gentle sound of rushing water brings
  a sense of peace to the river. A few 
  fishermen have parked their boats in the
  middle of the river and dropped nets in
  hopes of catching a few fish. The schools
  of fish sneak out of the way and hide in 
  the river grasses.

  Staring across the water's surface, tiny
  bubbles appear followed by a small turtle.
  He peeks his head up and catches some 
  afternoon rays. Below the surface, a school
  of fancy tailed guppies swims in a circle
  leaving a rainbow of swirling colours.

  Trees shade the river bank making it hard 
  to see the bottom of the river. Something 
  stirs the muddy bottom and floats to the 
  top. Peeking from beneath a giant lily pad,
  it croaks and sinks beneath the surface 
  again.

  The dusty little town serves as a travel stop
  more than anything. To the east, there is a 
  home that used to serve the governor during his
  stay here in Wellington. Now, it too is as old 
  and rundown looking as the rest of this little
  town. To the east is a pub or restaurant stop of 
  some sort that keeps changing hands.

  Wellington has been nearly a ghost town
  for so long that the streets are covered
  over in dirt as the winds blow down from
  the mountains. Very few people cross through
  Wellington and those that do are doing just 
  that: passing THROUGH Wellington. Few ever
  stay.

{R}
  This small tavern has changed hands many 
  times, but one thing is certain: it will
  always be open. For now, it's called the 
  RoadKill Grill. The original place was much 
  like the Grunting Boar which remains in
  operation after years of serving Midgaardians.
  But the Dancing Boar didn't have the same 
  luck. The owners quickly sold and the taverns,
  pubs, inns, and such that followed never stay long.

  The weeds grow to waist high while the 
  paint peels off this estate-sized home.
  Where the home had been built for the 
  governor's use while staying in Wellington,
  it is now occupied by six families. All
  are too poor to care for the home as it 
  had once been. The gate leading to the 
  back of the property hangs on one hinge.

  On the edge of Wellington, the wild flowers
  grow abundantly. The town managed to stay
  small over the years despite the design of
  the governor to let it grow into a great
  industrial center. Today, the few citizens 
  that remain here do so in poverty.
