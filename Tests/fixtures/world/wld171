{YELL}Enter the Forest of Talgithir{yell}~

    {YELL}You find yourself wondering though the thick forests
    of {WHI}Gothir, {YELL}heading towards the {RE}Castle of Talgithir.
    {YELL}A thick canopy is over your head and not much light is 
    filtering through. The lack of sound coming from these
    surroundings are enough to make the sanest of men go
    crazy. You being to feel a little uneasy.{yell}

{RED}Approaching a fortress{blink}~
{BLACK,BO}
    After miles of trudging through the steppes,
    the silhouette of a large fortress appears ahead.
               The fortress of Tenaka!
    The old khan built it in the height of his reign
    when he was ruling.  Though it doesn't seem real
    sturdy.  The nomadic Nadir seem to lack construction
    skills.

    As you approach the fortress, you reconsider
    your previous thoughts about the fortress's weakness
    it is nearly as strong as the Keep at Talgithir,
    and boiling with Nadir.  There is a deep gorge 
    to the north of here.

{BLAC,BO}Before The Ancient Gates{blin}~
 {BLACK,BO}
    The ancient gates barely hang on the
    hinges.  The iron is rusted, and looks
    almost immovable.

{BLA,BO}Ancient Courtyard{blink}~
 {BLACK,BO}
    Piles of stone that have fallen off the wall are
    scattereed about the edges of the courtyard.  The 
    ramparts look as if they are about to collapse, as
    do the towers.  The whole castle is in awful
    condition, except for the gatehouse...
