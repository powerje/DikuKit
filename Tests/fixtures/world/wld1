Cryogenics Lab~

  You slowly open your eyes as you look into a bright light.
  You can't believe what your eyes are seeing. There are
  high-rises that could reach the heaven's and spaceship's
  flying everywhere. You notice a ship flying by and it's
  flashing a message, "Happy New Years January 1, 3000."
  You can't believe where all the time has gone too, as you
  step out of the cryogenic unit.

  As you walk outside, you gaze all around you. There are 
  spaceships flying everywhere and people zooming through
  the transparent elevated pneumatic tube. At the end of 
  the tube you can see people shooting out of the tube and
  smashing into a wall. The vehicles in the streets don't
  have wheels they are just hovering a few inches off the
  ground. As you look up you can see the tall skyscrapers
  everywhere and more transparent elevated pneumatic tubes.

  There are spaceships flying everywhere and people zooming
  through the transparent elevated pneumatic tubes. At the
  end of the tube people continue to smash into the wall.
  People would rather take the transparent elevated pneumatic
  tubes than use the jet packs to get to work. The vehicles
  in the streets don't have wheels instead they are just
  hoving a few inches off the ground. As you look up you can
  see the tall skuscrapers everywhere and more transparent

  Splat!! Another speedy exit from a transparent pneumatic
  tube. As you walk down the street, you notice a long 
  line of people. They're all waiting outside a booth. Oh 
  wow, a phone booth. You stand in line waiting for your
  turn to use the phone. Behind you a robot gets in line, 
  he introduces himself as Bender. The two of you start 
  to talk and you've become friends with the robot. It's your
  turn to use the booth, as you step into the booth Bender
  follows in behind you.

  poster has a picture of a robot dressed up what looks
  like a American flag jacket and wearing a top hat and
  it has a white beard. It's pointing at you and saying...

  They ask if you are HUMAN or ROBOT. They start by giving you
  a question in which you have to pick from 3 choices. The first
  choice is a Flower, the next choice is a puppy and the last
  choice is a floppy disk.

  don't need to goto the bathroom. You spot a couple of
  barrels in the street, you can go take a leak behind them. 
  You better hurry before some robot come by and sees what
  your doing. Too late, a robot with a hot resin gun sees 
  that you are leaking and offers to seal up that leak of 
  yours. But you decline its offer and you pretend that 
  nothing happened so you can continue on your way.

  are a few rocks and bushes nearby. As you gaze out in the

  are all dead, but you never did have any friends. As you
  look around the around you can see some double doors
  towards the west. As you make your way towards the doors
  a alarm goes off, you can hear voices and footsteps coming
  from the southern wall. But you don't see a door there, all
  you can see is some kind of slot on the wall. A light on
  the southern wall starts to flash and a door starts to open.
  Time to get out of here fast as you head towards the double
  sliding doors.

  the darkness. These 5 figures are the Rulers of Chapek 9.

Desert's of Chapek 9~

  As you look around all you can see is a dry desert field.
  Your mouth is parched from the lack of water. Each time
  you take a step, dirt kicks up from under your feet. Every
  direction that you look at, all you can see are deserts
  everywhere. There are a few rocks and bushes nearby. As
  you gaze out in the distance you can see some mountains.
  Towards the north you can see what looks like a very large
  city. Above the front gates it looks like a electricity
  moving between two towers with spheres on top of the towers.

  As the door opens, you and Bender step out of the

  as you are about to kick the booth. The voice on the 
  speaker says "Thank you for using Stop and Drop, 
  America's Favorite Suicide Booth since 2008!!" WHAT... 
  This wasn't a phone booth but a suicide booth. Good

  on the lunar rover ride. It's a educational ride but the 
  lines are short. You get to wear a spacesuit and ride in 
  a lunar rover. Now you will get a chance to see the real  
  moon with all it's craters. Maybe you can go find the 
  original moon landing site.

  OH NO, your sinking... You try to get out before the lunar
  rover sinks but you can't. Only one chance to get out of the
  crater, you use your air tank to launch yourself out of the
  crater. But in doing that you are almost out of air.

  does see Bender in the barn and points his shotgun at
  Bender. You and Bender run out the back way and into

  Oh geez, this room is small. It looks like a closet and 
  the only thing in here is a light hanging from the ceiling. 
  There's no room in here for any furniture or a place to hang 
  your clothes up. There's barely enough room to lay down 
  or to have two people sitting on the floor. You see a fruit 
  salad tree sitting on the floor. Yum. the fruit on that tree 
  looks delicious. Hope Bender doesn't mind if you grab a 
  banana or a apple for the road. As you look around you see
  something on the northern wall.

  towards your left there are a bunch of monitors on the wall. 
  Hmm, must be security monitors or something. As you 
  walk towards Mom, it looks like she's getting taller and 
  your getting smaller. Hmm Mom's desk is like a judge's

  what that was. You goto the cargo hold and check on the 
  animals. Where did all the animals go... The only animal
  that's in here is that little black animal with three eyes.
  It seems that it ate all the other animals and it took a poop
  It's poop looks like dark matter, it should be enough fuel
  to get you home and off this planet. But first you gotta get
  it first.
