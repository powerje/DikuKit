{C}Entrance {W}to the {BLU,BO}Blue {bo,Y}Trials{y}~
   You enter the musty area beneath the blue temple and stop in awe.
The stonework here is simply incredible--a combination of dwarven
stonemanship and elven artistry.  On the wall there is an inscription:

'Only those who brave the elder beasts may arrive safely at the orb.'

   There is a door to the east.

the city, no doubt to keep the marauding monsters at bay.  The city is

along the edge of a cliff.  Beyond the cliff you see a dark ocean,
reflecting the starlight above very feebly.  The road continues west
