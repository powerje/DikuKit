   Arriving at camp you sense and odd occurance torches burn in only one part
   of the camp where there were many before. Just inside the camp you see all
   of your fellow soldiers fallen on the groud Dead. Coming from the area lit
   by torches you barely hear a soft laughter that could only be described as
   an evil man happy with what he's done.

   Inside the camp you see more of your brethren fallen, killed with a mighty
   sword. The torches are burning brighter as you draw nearer to them, but an
   even more disturbing sound of joy is now mixed with the laughter you heard
   before. You grip your weapon tightly as the sight of all this death begins
   to eat away at your fragile sanity.

   You wake surrounded by a display of filth so vile you can barely stomach a

   brink of starvation. One prisoner in particular looks to be coveting a key
   to the cell door. Wondering why he hasn't left you hear him trying to talk
   but all you hear is gibberish.

   A beautiful green pasture is laid out ahead of you with an small dirt path

   also plain to see he does not like strangers in his shop, wielding a large
   double-bladed battle axe. Leaping the counter without a second thought the
   this man lets out a battle cry you would think that a demon had invaded. A

{BO,BLU} Kyaro City {bo,blu}~
{BO,BLU}
   Home Sweet Home!! You see people conducting casual business around town, a
   frail woman walking down the side of the road, stopping to help she has a
   look of fear in her eyes. Looking around town you see lots of peole trying
   to avoid you. You better hurry home to find out any news.
