moving water. The tunnel leads from east to west.

The dunes at the windy shore.~
  You are at the hill of a little dune on a windy shore. To the north
you can see the great sea. The air is filled with the fresh smell
of sea water. Seagulls draw their circles into the air and their
cries echo in your head. To the east there is a large cliff. At the
bottom of it you see a wide open tunnel. West of here the dunes
continue.
