   Does this place gives a sense of belonging, or is it Time to Go?{y}

   madly. In fact, that old guy in the corner looks as though he has been

All around you are people eating all kind of combinations of toppings on their
pizzas. The booth seats look most comfortable, and seem to afford the best
privacy too. Many of the young couples seem to use this place more to
make out than to actually eat pizza. They don't seem to mind the amount of 
time it takes for the food to be served. Hmmmm.... that might be an idea for
your next anniversary. Ah well, let's see about getting a table before they
are all taken.

Halfway Down Disabled Ramp~
     You are halfway down the ramp, and you begin to wonder about what 
might be at the end of the ramp. What if it isn't some nice splash into 
muddy water? What if it is actually a huge gaping hol ground....??? Or some 
nicely designed deathtrap?
     Or what if you land on you head, and break your scrawny neck? Suddenly 
your glee changes to panic. You begin to really worry about the outcome of
your fall.
       Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!
             Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
  
                    Heeeeeeeeeeeeeellllllllllllllllllllppppppppppppp!!!!!!!

Almost At The Bottom Of The Disabled Ramp~

     You are approaching the end of the ramp.... and you can just makeout 
a dark area in front of the ramp..... D*MN!!! And the thought did cross your 
mind to take the stairs. So much for the easy way down. You start swearing
to yourself, and promise yourself that the next time when you have a hunch
you will follow it. I guess now you have to start worrying about how to 
collect equipment. (If you have fly, it might be a flying death_trap), but 
then again maybe not......
     You hear some evil laughter from behind you..... Muhahahaha!!!!!!  Those 
damn immortals are having a field trip at your expense. They just love 
watching an avatar die when he has no control over the situation.
      You think to yourself 'And I had cool equipment.., ah well.. better hit 
return and stop postponing the inevitible!'

In Front Of Disabled Ramp~



                     *SSSSSSSPPPPPPPLLLLLAAAAAATTTTTTT!!!!*
     Mud splashes everywhere!! Ewwwwww..... some got in your 
mouth (it has salty taste), and you can feel some seeping into
the crack of your behind. That should make walking uncomfortable 
for a while...... *sigh*. At least you are not hurt. You stand up and 
try to shake off as much of the mud as possible, but only end up 
streaking it more. You manage to rub most of it into your clothe. 
     You can still hear the sound of those kids coming from somewhere 
to the north. They are cheering now. Hope they aren't making fun of me???

   The sound of kids having fun is getting louder, but there is a new tone

come back to your surroundings, and realize that there is a smell in the
air that was not there before. The smell is getting to you. You grab your
tummy as it suddenly starts to heave..... whatever that smell is, it is
REALLY bad. And it seems to be getting stronger. *Ack Pttt!!*

Path To Parking Deck~
Now the smell is close to unbearable. Almost as though you are standing
next to a ten day old corpse, that has been left to the mercy of the
sun and rain. But it is even worse. Deg!!! What do they keep back here?
From the smell of things it is almost as though this is where all the
corpses from the MUD are dropped. Or at least close to this place.
Ewwwwwwww!!!!! You just want to get away from the smell before you
completely lose all that you have ever eaten.

Dumpster Area~

This is the Pizza Hut dumpster area as you can tell from the smell.
All the stuff people don't want, and things not fit to be put on the
pizzas anymore are thrown here. And when we say "things that are
 not fit to be put on pizza......', well you can figure the rest out. The
dumpster has not been emptied in a long while. Not since the garbage
company quit because two of their men died from the smell of the
dumpster area. Oh well, nothing much here.... just a couple of corpses
that have all the meaty portions removed.
   By the way, before you leave.... if you find any spare corpses lying
around bring them in. We are kind of low on toppings. *wink*

This is the door leading to the back of the house. It is usually locked,
and only the BusBoy and Waitresses are allowed to come through. It
is usually mostly used by the BusBoy, because the Waitresses hardly
need to go back and forth (hardly any food gets made, and so they don't
need to serve it).

Path To Parking Deck~
The smell seems to be getting less. Almost as though you are getting
further away from an excavated grave. The smell is reducing, and the
laughter is getting louder by the second. Better concentrate on finding
those kids, and making sure those freaking kids have not messed with
your car. You hurry along looking for a way to get to the parking
garage deck.

Walking Up Ramp~
     Hope they haven't harmed Betsy. It keeps going through your mind 
like  broken record. That car is your baby (now ain't that cute). You 
hurry on to make sure your pin VW Beetle has not been violated. But 
walking up this stupid parking garage ramp is getting to you. 'Why the 
hell can't these people get an elevator like all other civilized 
corporations??? You struggle up the ramp, and hope that it isn't much 
longer.....

Top Of Ramp~
Sigh!!! Finally you have made it. Now to take care of those stupid kids
who think they can mess with Betsy and get away with it. You mutter
angrily under your breath as you head toward where you parked your car.
All the while thinking to yourself of all the things you would do to the
kids if there is so much as one scratch on your car.

Ramp Platform~
You have reached the parking deck platform, and you can see what all the
disturbance is about. There is a group of skateboarding kids playing around
here, and they seem to be having a ball. In the distance you can make out some
kid standing on ol' Betsy. *growl* You walk toward your car with one intention 
in mind, 'Kick that kids butt!!!' Hope it will be easy...

These kids are blocking your progress.. they seem to think it is some kind
of game. Defending some lunatic kid standing on your precious Betsy. If they
don't climb out of your way pretty fast, you might need to resort to some violence.
These kids are really getting to be a pain.
