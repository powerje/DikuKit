Delpher's Room Among the Stars~
In the middle of the room you see a huge diamond desk covered with maps and
ancient tomes. Then as you look around you see that all the walls are covered
with shelves of books, large, small, every type of magical texts known to
gods and mortals. Finally as you look up, you are struck with awe as you look
directly into the cosmos, millions of stars and planets hanging before your
eyes. The beauty is soo great you just want to sit here and weep tears of joy.
You will never forget looking into the heart of the galaxy and feeling so
humbled by it's awesome power.....

A Comfortable Jail Cell~
YOU ARE IN JAIL! There are several comfortable chairs for you to sit in
and an invisible servant carrying drinks around. You have a strong feeling
there is no escape from here. SO JUST SIT DOWN AND BE QUIET. 
Thank You.

Nothing to See Here~
In the center of the room hovers a crystal table, covered with charts,
graphs, and drawings.  As you look around the room, you see nothing but
darkness, pitch black in all directions except for a dull white light
that shines down upon the table.  Obviously this room has but a single
purpose.

of normalcy and peace.  Go for it.

Flying Above the Castle~
From up here you can see the entire castle and all the surrounding lands. The
sight is quite breathtaking and you must remind yourself not to linger, for
the Guardian of the Gate is flying around the area, waiting for foolish
trespassers to approach the castle gate.

In the Air~
  You are floating in the air above the castle.  Below you
there is a lush garden and behind that stands a dark,
ominous looking castle.  It is rumored that the Guardian
of the Gate keeps watch over it from up here.

Gate to the Castle of Darkness~

  Before you stands a gate of monstrous proportions, the bars intricately
woven into the shapes of towering dragons over forty feet high. As you
test the strength of the portcullis, you notice that is forged of some
unknown, blackened metal.  You would think that several giants would be
needed to sunder these gates!  Beyond it, you see the lush garden
and a pathway leading up to the castle doors.
There is a sign here.

Path to the Courtyard~
Here lies a small path surrounded by a lush garden and beautiful trees.

clouds in the background. Nonetheless the garden seems perfect except for one
thing.....you hear no animals or birds around at all, very unusual...

Courtyard Before the Castle~
You find yourself on a marble walkway through the courtyard, on both sides
of you there are exquisite sculptures of ancient heroes and dragons, even the
walkway is covered in mosaics of angels and other mystical creatures. The
smell of the garden and all the beautiful art fills you with a deep sense of
serenity.....until you look up and see the castle looming over you, then all
you feel is a slight shiver going down your back, death awaits you.

You expected a prince's room to be very grand, but this room seems to be quite
simple. The walls are adorned with scrolls written in some forgotten language,
and in the middle of the room sits a mat used for meditation, the room seems 
more like a cell the more you think about it.

Antechamber to the Prince's Room~
On the wall to your right you see paintings of the old royal family, those 
nobles who ruled over this land before it was brought to chaos by hordes of
creatures. The largest portrait is of Prince Lars, supposedly a warrior of
awesome might, and the owner of the famed Glass Sword. The wall on your
left is much less ornate and is decorated with strange armors and weapons
from other lands, and behind you is just a small shrine to some gods you do
not know of.

black metal as the castle gate, you doubt any sort of battering ram would go

waves of evil and power emanating from the other side of the doors.

Entrance to the Elven Hall~
You have entered the Elven Halls and immediately feel a bit safer, you look
around and see large tapestries of green forests and rolling hills, even the
walls are etched with pictures of flowers and other nature scenes. Then you
notice the large feathers on the ground, and the feeling of wings buffeting
above you.

Elven Halls~
As you walk farther into the Elven Halls, you notice the same types of
tapestries and paintings on the walls. You really wish you could take some
of these exquisite pieces with you, then as you look closer, there seems to
be an awful lot of dust laying around...or are those spider webs?

To your suprise you have entered a lavishly furnished room. There's
silk on the bed and all the furniture, breathtaking paintings and
frescoes on the walls, and gems imbedded into almost everything.  You
had heard rumors that the Master had an Elven adopted daughter who 
commanded his great armies and those rumors also said she wielded
great power....

Entrance to the Hall of the Dead~
Upon entering the Hall of the Dead you instantly begin to gag, the stench of
rotting flesh is simply unbelievable. After getting a bit more use to the 
smell, you look around and see bones all over the place, human, animal, and
some that you couldn't even begin to guess at. Suddenly you're overcome by 
an overwhelming urge to flee, you know this fear is...unnatural.

You have now entered the castle halls, these long narrow corridors seem to
spread throughout the castle like a labyrinth. Your sense of direction has
gone ascew from staring at seemingly endless hallways, and from the fear
that more creatures lie ahead, waiting for you. But you know you cannot
spend much time to collect your bearings, you hear the shadow creatures
getting closer.....

look around and see that there are no bones or rotting flesh strewn across 
the floor, just a throne made of human bones, sitting in the middle of the
room. There's no mistake that this is the room of Abigail, the necromancer.

huge marble pillars rise up several hundred feet to where you'd imagine the
ceiling would be, a layer of dep black obsidian covers the floor, and a long
narrow red carpet stretches to the other side of the room where one man
stands. He stands there with confidence, a look of arrogance on his face, you
instinctively know it's Archmage Karus, disciple of the Master, and 
definitely a force to be reckon with.

where a tall figure stands. Then you look upon him, he shines like a bright

the fine polished marble floor you can see your reflection in, to the ivory
pillars etched with fantastic designs, and decorated with huge paintings of
ancient heroes and battles. The Master definitely has excellent taste.

in the past, the temple of midgaard looks brand new and the surrounding lands
are much more beautiful and cleaner than they are now. All the other 
tapestries depict similar scenes, suddenly you feel nostalgic for the past,
from now on you'll never forget what used to be, and you'll never be content
with what there is now.

These thousands of pieces of equipment fill you with almost as much awe as
what lies before you on the floor, dozens and dozens of creatures, some
frozen in ice, others stuffed, and a few with just a piece of their bodies
left. Standing next to a dragon tooth that is larger than you are, you
decide to leave this stuff alone, you have way too much respect to touch such
an amazing collection.
