Manhattan~
As you drive across the Brooklyn bridge you can see the great island of 
Manhattan. As you drive across the bridge you can see to the west the 
famous clock tower, that is home to the police station.  As you drive 
further along you can just make out the weird house to the south, it is 
rumored that the person that lives there hasn't come out for years and
has never been seen by the few houses that are close enough to see the
front of it. To the east you can see The Xanatos building that has recently
acquired a castle on top of it. The castle cost a lot of money to move and
David Xanatos never would give a reason to the putting of it on top of the 
worlds largest building. Because of the mystery behind the case you think
that you should go ask Xanatos first and then head over to the police
station to see what other clues you can dig up.

Lobby~
As you walk into the lobby of this massive building, you can see that this 
man spares no expense in his buildings. There is a massive desk by the wall 
with a lazy guard behind it. You can see by the video camera's on the walls 
that no  one would ever break into this build and make it to the top. As you 
walk forward to the elevator the guard greets you and asks what you are 
doing here. After some explaining you finally convince the guard that you 
are really who you  say and he waves you on saying "Mr. Xanatos is waiting."

Elevator~
This is a giant elevator maybe 10 feet by 10 feet by 10 feet. It has 
a very weird song playing, that you will have stuck in your head all 
night.  As the elevator starts going up you can feel almost no 
movement traces like normal elevators, this must be top of the 
line. Some of the other people in the elevator are looking at you 
with weird looks, almost like you were out of the age of  knights.

Hallway~
It looks as if you got off in the middle of the castle. The hallway 
your in is covered with banners and suits of armor along the walls. 
There is a number of windows and your surprised at the amount of 
light coming into the hall. You can hear the noises of something 
yelling or is it growling? Well you can always come back and look 
on your way out, but now you have to go question Mr. Xanatos.

Xanatos's command room~
This is a massive room with a lot of TV monitors on the walls. 
You can just make out about three doors, your not sure though 
because they appear to be hidden. You see at the far end of the 
room a large desk with a giant chair behind it. As you walk 
further into the room you can see what look like a metal gargoyle. 
Wait a sec that's not a metal gargoyle it's Xanatos in a suit 
designed to look like a gargoyle. Maybe this is why people have 
reported seeing gargoyles all over the place, well better start 
asking questions, he looks mad.

Bedroom~
This is the largest bedroom you have ever seen. It has a double 
giant king size bed that seams to cross a time zone. You can see 
a large window on the northern wall of the room that's about 
twice your size. There is a small outlet on the wall that looks 
to have housed a gun of some sort but it's now empty. You can 
see something off by the window moving and it makes you uneasy.

Before the Window~
As you walk over to the window you seem to be engulfed in shadows 
and can't see more then a few feet other then the small amount of 
light from the window. You walk forward into the light of the 
window when just as fast as you can see something moves out of 
the shadows and into your path.  From the light of the window 
you can see that it is large maybe 8 feet tall and hairy all over. 
It growls at you as if you were it's next meal. As you prepare for 
battle you wonder WHO this beast used to be and WHAT Xanatos 
did to it.

Bottom of the stairs~
You pause at the base of a massive set of steps. Before you the 
clock tower rises high into the sky, a seemingly endless expanse 
of glass and stone. Behind you sirens sounds loud and clear in the 
cool air. Police cars line the street in front, and pedestrians and 
officers move in what seems like an intricate dance of movements 
in and out of the building itself. High above the hand of the clock 
tower moves ever closer to striking the hour, loud enough to drown 
out the wailing sirens and general noise of the city to announce 
the passage of time.

Top of the stairs~
Resting a moment at the top of the stairs you wonder just what 
you are getting into. A beautiful red head pushes you aside 
and quickly disappears into the streets below. You glance one 
more time at the massively impressive architecture of the 
police building itself then move off ready to face what lies ahead.

Front desk~
Entering the main entrance room you find yourself before the 
'welcome' desk. Behind it rests several officers drinking coffee 
and doing paperwork. They look so very busy that you simply glance 
at the map of the building to see where to go. To the north you notice 
the captains office noted with a bright gold star and then a long 
hallway leading to a bunch of the detectives offices.

Captain's office~
The captains office is sparsely decorated. Her big dark wooden desk 
takes up most of the space in the very center of the office. Resting 
on it is the ever full in basket and a rather empty looking out basket. 
As well several pictures and a pen set have made residence there. 
On the walls are several plaques. You take a moment to glance over 
them seeing various certificates of her office and schooling, and 
one for something in leadership, which says high honors, though you 
have never heard of that particular award before.

Back Hallway~
The wide hallway is well lit and surprisingly well traveled. The 
tan walled corridor is lighted by old fashion, although electric, 
wall lamps. Two detectives  deep in conversation pass by not 
even noticing you as you shrink towards the wall. The farther 
you move down the hallway the less people you pass by. You glance 
at the doors names along the way.. Matt Bluestone...Henry..and ah 
yes Detective Maza.

Elisa Maza's office~
The door closes noisily behind you as you enter Elisa Maza's 
office. Light streams in through the window lighting the mess 
of paperwork on her desk labeled in various colors of ink and 
words of urgency. You grin as you glance down at a Top Secret 
Extremely Urgent document and find it open. However before you 
get a chance to read anything within the folder is suddenly 
closed by a hand and you blink in surprise and look up to find 
yourself facing on of the man who grumbles something you can't 
quite make out except for the 'wait here...'

Closet~
This small brown room houses some of the janitorial supplies. As 
well a wide ladder heads almost strait up into the clock tower 
above. From here you can hear the clicks, whirs, and groans of the 
clocks mechanisms as the grind slowly onwards. You bump into a 
pail which resounds emptily before you move on.

Giant room inside the tower~
You stand in a giant room. The ceiling is so far above you that it is 
lost in the shadows and the room itself is filled with huge gears 
clicking slowly through their endless circular rounds. The stone 
floor is cold, and the smells drifting by you are quite .. unique to 
this room. In front of you a double set of stone stairs lead upwards 
to a door which appears to lead to the outside ledge.

You stand by a refrigerator which can hold enough food to feed an army..
or six hungry gargoyles. Its once white, now yellowish door rests 
closed for the moment trying with a desperate a growl to draw 
enough energy to keep its contents cold. It rests somehow keeping 
on the same stone slab despite its loud growling noises. The gears 
of the clock whir above you.

You stand atop the ledge inside the clock tower. On one side of you 
the stairs lead back down into the interior and on the other a 
shimmering yellow glass door leads to the outside ledge. The door 
appears to have no obvious handle, just hinges. It is framed by the 
larger yellow glass which reflects back by shadow the time the 
clock tower chimes to the city.

Outside on a ledge~
A chill wind slides through your clothing. The suns light providing 
practically no warmth at all. Huge, life-size statues rest on huge 
stone blocks in front of you. Each is stretched out in a different pose, 
wings spread and facing outwards they seem to scream a silent 
protest to the world. Surrounding the tower are the huge skyscraper 
buildings of the city. You peek over the edge to the street far below 
and see the cars whizzing past the station looking like tiny ants 
from this distance. Another chill wind blows through your clothes 
and you sincerely consider going back inside.

A side entrance to the clock~
Not the main entrance into the clock tower but an entrance none 
the less offering the slight warmth of the inside. The wooden door 
blends in remarkably well to the side of the clock tower. It rests 
inset to one side of the yellow hued glass clock. The metal hands 
of the clock work their way around the circle of numbers slowly 
passing the time. The huge stone gargoyles rest behind you in the 
sun casting long shadows on the glass.

A Podium~
You are in a small room. Stone floors reach to the cool stone and 
metal walls. It seems to surround you in near darkness. However 
along one side rests three podiums. Each is lit by a single candle 
light and two appear empty but one looks to be holding something..
although from the gleam of it you aren't sure what it is until you 
move a little closer.
