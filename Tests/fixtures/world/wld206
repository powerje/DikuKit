A dark Corner.~
  You have entered a dark corner of the forest. The darkness reaches out
for you and you feel something pricking your skin. The screams have

to you from the shadows. Weak voices crying 'Blood, blood so sweet, bones
that crack to fill you mouth. So sweet, Blood, blood so sweet,
bones..........

A small hallway.~
  Blocking the way south you see before you one of lifes monstrosities.
This half-man half-wolf creature looks at you with starving eyes. He
seems to be intent on stopping your passage south. The light seems to be
getting stronger...that is, when your vision is not blocked.

A dark crypt.~
  Carefully crafted stone is around you everywhere. The cob webs make an
interesting lacework of the dark walls. The shadows given off from your
light seem to stretch to their limits as if to break free. A dim light
can barely be seen to the south and you wonder what on earth could be
down here.

up from below, making the webs move and your soul flee.

 gain high levels(25-40), they should try the forest. There is talk of
ghouls and ravens to be vanquished there. Also there is a legend. Ghosts
of a defeated band of warriors are said to walk the forest searching for
vengance. In the swamp one will find the way hard(level 50 +). It be said
that a powerful monster rules a kingdom there. Choose your path and may Gods
