{R,BO}In Front of {Y}Anne Frank's {R}House{b}~

{R}  As you look at the house where Anne Frank was kept hidden from
{BLA,BO}  the Germans in the Second World War, you feel as if you can 
{b}{R}  taste the fear she must've felt, being surrounded by people who
{BLA,BO}  had only the extermination of her and others like her on their
{b}{R}  minds! Before you, you see the entrance to the house, which is
{BLA,BO}  now a museum of sorts. Remembering that the tourguide had 
{b}{R}  mentioned that a visit to this house was included in the trip, 
{BLA,BO}  you open the door and..............{b}

{Y}  Now that was strange.....  You still feel wobbly from entering
{Y}  that door. That certainly didn't feel like going through a door!
{Y}  What the hell could have happened?? When you finally regain 
{Y}  enough sense to look around, you get the distinct impression
{Y}  that this is not a museum, but a house where people actually
{Y}  live. No bright brochures, no signs telling you where to find 
{Y}  the restrooms, no ticket counter, no nothing. What is this?!?!?{b}

{R,BO}The Impressionist Exhibit{b}~

{R}  The paintings of the impressionists show you a view of the world that you
{R}  know, yet not quite.  With rough strokes, points, and other special 
{R}  techniques they give you two views of the world in one painting,  the unknown
{R}  and the known, in a constant battle and clash.  Monet, Manet, Renoir,
{R}  Pissaro and many many others have contributed in their own, particular
{R}  fashion to this form of art, but none so overwhelming as Van Gogh.  Some of
{R}  his painting are exhibited here as well, on loan from the Van Gogh museum,
{R}  which is just across the road from the Rijksmuseum.  For some reason, your
{R}  attention keeps getting drawn to one of his paintings, and you keep falling
{R}  deeper and deeper in a {Y,BO}golden day{b}{R}, where a flock of {BLA,BO}crows {b}{R}navigates the

{C}  The modernists, close to abstract, but well beyond the first steps on the
{C}  road away from realism that the impressionists explored.  A fine example
{C}  of this type of art is shown in this wing.  You are surrounded by paintings
{C}  by Gaugin, who's sometimes seen as an impressionist, but more often the first
{C}  of the modernists and a true symbolist.  Dali, who uses realism to make it
{C}  surreal, Degas and Klimt, who had their own interpretation of reality.  
{C}  Many different views of reality try to crowd your mind at once, but none
{C}  more than Magritte, whose rearrangement of reality simply boggles the mind.
{C}  Especially captivating is a painting of an eye, a particular kind of mirror.{b}

{Y,BO}The Abstract Exhibit{b}~

{WH,BO}  Abstraction of reality, to take reality so far away from itself that it
{WH,BO}  starts leading its own life, is the most challenging of the art forms that
{WH,BO}  have developed over the centuries.  It taxes both creator and observer in
{WH,BO}  numerous, sometimes very subtle ways.  On the one hand, it can be 
{WH,BO}  childishly simple and in its simplicity reveal a very complex truth, on the
{WH,BO}  other hand, it can be extraordinarily complex, so complex, that the obvious 
{WH,BO}  truth is hidden in layers of deception.  Some of the finest 
{WH,BO}  examples of this artform can be found here.  Paintings by Picasso, Appel,
{WH,BO}  de Koning and Mondriaan.  The childlike simplicity of the Red and Yellow
{WH,BO}  and Blue squares of the Mondriaan paintings has an appeal.  Though
{WH,BO}  its stark logical execution make them very difficult to appreciate.

{R}  OH SHIT!!!!!!  This did not go as planned.....  I sure hope you
{R}  know what you are doing......  As you hold on to the tiny strand
{R}  that is the only remains of the painting that you can see,  you
{R}  notice that you are surrounded by an immense darkness that seems
{R}  to draw you in.....   Plunging into that darkness looks like something
{R}  you would want to avoid at all cost......  

{R,BO}  The only way out of here seems to be to follow this tiny strand that
{R,BO}  you are holding on to.....   Then, you notice something else.  You 
{R,BO}  appear to be all alone,  none of your friends are anywhere that you
{R,BO}  can see....  Where the heck are they?!?!?!?!?{b}

{BLA,BO}  A blackness so vast it is incomprehensible weighs down on you like nothing

{BLA,BO}  reality is drawn from.  Its creativity, its wonder, it all comes from the
{BLA,BO}  vast, vast unknowns beyond that which we know.  Looking around, you can
{BLA,BO}  discern the remnants of those who dwelt here during their lives.  Close to
{BLA,BO}  you, you can feel the presence of one such, who has been here many a time
{BLA,BO}  during his short corporeal existence.  He must feel some comfort in this 
{BLA,BO}  place where he has dwelt before, since he has chosen to remain here for
{BLA,BO}  all of eternity........{b}
