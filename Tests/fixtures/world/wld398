{BLACK,BOLD}The Prairie{b}~

{BO,BLA}   You see nothing but a great prairie on every side. Neither
   tree nor house breaks the wide sweep of flat plains that
   extend to the edge of the sky in all directions. The sun has 
   bleached the tilled land into a gray landscape. Even the 
   grass is not green, as the sun has baked the once green tops 
   of the long blades until they are the same gray color. Once, 
   the little house had been painted, but it too has faded under 
   the blistering sun. From the far north, you hear a low wail 
   of the wind.{b}

{BLACK,BOLD}A Small Wooden House{b}~

   {BO,BLA}Lumber to build this small one-room house must have
   been carried by wagon for many miles across the great 
   Kansas prairies. The house has no garret or real cellar, just 
   a small hole dug in the ground where the family could go in 
   case of a cyclone. Lining the walls are a rusty looking 
   cookstove, a cupboard for the dishes, a small wooden table,
   and the beds.

{BOLD,BLACK}The Cyclone{b}~

   {BO,BLA}You rise through the air, as if you were going up in a balloon. It
   is very dark, and the wind howls around you so loudly that you 
   nearly become deaf. The great pressure on every side of you 
   raises you up higher and higher.

   pieces when you fell. As the hours pass, you stop worrying and 
   resolve to calmly await your fate. In spite of the roaring winds
   you close your eyes and fall asleep.

{BO,GRE}Behind the Curtain{b}~

   {BO,GRE}You pull away a green drape that covers a small booth, exposing 
   a small, very ordinary looking man who is furiously and frantically 
   pulling levers, hitting switches, and turning dials on an elaborate 
   machine. 

   Just as surprised as you, the little man turns and says meekly, 
   "I have been making believe, using tricks and props to create my
   illusions."{b}

   you see a farmhouse. Uncle Henry must have built this 
   after the old one was carried away.

   Scattered around are many houses made entirely of 
   porcelain. These houses are quite small, the biggest of 
   them reaching only as high as your waist. There are also 
   pretty little barns, with china fences around them.{b}

   draw near, the cow suddenly gives a kick and kicks over 
   the stool, the pail, and even the milkmaid herself. All fall 
   on the china ground with a great clatter.  You are shocked 
   to see that the cow has broken her leg off, and that the pail 
   is lying in several small pieces, while the poor milkmaid 
   has a nick in her left elbow.{b}

   {YEL}After climbing down from the china you find yourself in a 
   disagreeable country, full of bogs and marshes and covered 
   with tall, rank grass. It is difficult to walk without falling 
   into muddy holes, for the grass is so thick that it hides them 
   from sight. {b}

   {b,RED}We are all threatened by a fierce enemy which has lately 
   come into this forest. It is a most tremendous monster, like 
   a great spider, with a body as big as an elephant and legs as 
   long as tree trunks. It has eight of these long legs, and as 
   the monster crawls through the forest, it seizes animals with 
   its legs and drags them to its mouth, where it eats them as a 
   spider does a fly. Not one of us is safe while this fierce 
   creature is alive, and we had called a meeting to decide 
   how to take care of ourselves when you came among us.{b}

   covered from top to bottom with great pieces of rock.  It 
   appears to be a hard climb, but you must get over the hill, 
   nevertheless.  As you nearly reach the first rock, a loud

   ripening grain, with well-paved roads running between, and 
   pretty rippling brooks with strong bridges across them. The 
   fences and houses and bridges are all painted {BO,RED}bright red{b,CYA}, 
   just as they had been painted {BO,YEL}yellow{b,CYA} in the country of the 
   Winkies and {BO,BLU}blue{b,CYA} in the country of the Munchkins. The 
   Quadlings themselves, who are short and fat, are dressed
   all in red, which shows bright against the green grass and
   yellowing grain.
