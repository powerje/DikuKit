Before The Gates~

  You are standing before a set of giant gates.  The 
  gate are about fifteen feet high, and are topped with
  a barbed wire.  A large chain-link fence connects at
  both sides of the gates and surround a large building.
  A small guard house is situated just outside of the
  gates.

Inside The Gates~

  A small guard house stands vacant to the left. The
  roadway into the facility and past the guardhouse
  is blocked by a small barrier. The guard has left 
  the shelter of the guardhouse and stands directly 
  infront of you. He looks mean and well experienced
  in the art of killing. To go any further you must
  either convince him you work here.... or take him out.
  Both of which seem at this point highly impossible.

             The truth... is out there.

        ENFORCED UNDER THE CRIMINAL CODE OF NC MUDD

  However, for you who are brave enough, or foolish enough to enter,
welcome to the Xfiles.  This building was constructed to probe into
the mysteries of the unknown, and discover the answers to many unanswered
questions, such as 'Is there life on other planets?'.

  The truth of the Xfiles can only be discovered by groups of high level
avatars.  Even then, there is no guarantee that everyone will survive,
or that they will leave with all that they bring in.  That too, shall
remain an unanswered question, until you enter, and discover the truth
behind the Xfiles.

                                          Good Luck

Front Foyer~

  WOW... You can't help but be impressed with the 
  amazing colors and designs of this room. The glass
  ceiling is well above your head. Statues of famous 
  FBI Agents line the walls. Pictures of the founders 
  of the FBI also line the walls.  There are exits in
  every direction. It looks like it is pretty easy to
  get lost in such a huge place.

  are also among the pictures. Fox moulder really loves

{BO,R}West Hallway{bo,r}~

  You begin to walk down the west hallway.  The plush
  red carpet feels very soft under your tired feet. 
  Instead of the regular cement tiles found throughout
  the rest of this building, the walls in this hallway
  are covered in wood paneling.

  Jackets, guns and badges hang from hooks that line 
  the back wall.  The coffee machine has a fresh pot. 
  In fact, it always has a fresh pot brewed. A control
  panel is here with monitors showing video of random 
  locations throughout the place. On one monitor you 
  notice a cell, with an ugly red alien inside.

  As you exit the disinfection chamber, you enter a 
  small hallway where you see a lot of antiseptic 
  clothing hung on hooks on the walls.  You assume
  that you are supposed to wear this clothing after
  being sterilized.  However, you don't care about 
  sterilization since you are here to spill blood
  anyways.

  sure is packing. He is determined to keep things in
  order around here and uses brute force to do so.
  Better not slip up or it may be your last mistake.

  You try to move, but realize that you are too 
  tightly wedged in the metal to move.  Beads of sweat 
  start to pour freely from your forehead as panic
  begins to set in.  You look around you, and the panic
  is doubled.  You are located on a giant gear which is
  turning clockwise to power up another gear located ten 
  feet up.  As the gears meet, you let out a horrible 
  scream of pain, as you are squashed between the two
  giant pieces of metal.  On the good side though, your
  precious bodily fluids have done a good job lubricating
  the gear  system.  Its done  such a good job, that the 
  gears no longer squeak.

Bridge~

  You enter what is obviously the control center of
  the alien spaceship.  Directly in front of you is a 
  large chair with a small control panel on each side 
  of it.  You notice that there are five other identical
  seats all around this one.

Weapons Center~

  You enter what appears to be the weapons control 
  systems.   You see computers which tell targeting 
  information, weapons power supply, number of 
  projectile weapons and various other information.  
  It appears that everything is very much ahead of 
  our time and you get the impression that this 
  weapons technology could wipe out the human race.

Navigation Controls~

  You enter what appears to be the navigation control 
  center.  You see many computers which have various 
  star maps displayed on them.  They have data which 
  will tell them how to navigate throughout our Solar 
  System and throughout several other solar systems. 
  These maps are very detailed and very expansive. 
  You get the impression that these aliens  have done
  a lot of exploring of outer space.

Communications Controls~

  A large computer panel spans the interior of this
  room.  You see an alien switching several buttons.
  Out of the headset you hear some strange language
  you fail to understand.  As you get closer and the 
  alien flips a few more switches the language becomes 
  english then back to the other language.

Dark Tunnel~

  You are in a dark hallway.  To your north, you see 
  what appears to be a large cage.  Could it be, could 
  this be where the FBI has been holding an alien that
  they have captured?

Cancer Man's Office~

  You are in the office of the Cancerman.  The office
  is bare except for a desk and chair.  It looks like 
  he doesn't spend much time in here.  Probably because 
  he is always out looking for clues to give those two
  boneheads, Scully and Moulder.

A Secret Place~

  This is a secret place that obviously Kimbo did not 
  know about. You hear the incessant clickity-clack of
  a keyboard to your south.  Somebody must be doing some
  heavy coding in there.  I wonder who it could be.

Lord Kimbo's Cell~

  Pale grey walls line this small uncomfortable looking 
  cell.  An alien is here trapped under the FBI's power.
  He looks at you with eyes full of fear and bewilderment.
  How did they ever capture this alien and what do they 
  want with it?   Well you know what you want with it.
  That   damn aliens flag removed.  Now is your chance, 
  take this chance and kick its ass into submission!!!

You see a small slot in the wall where a key might fit.

   The writing seems to be quite ancient, and has already started
to erode away with time.  At first, the message is quite illegible,
however, as you study it you begin to be able to make out the words.

   Greetings adventurer, 
My name is Darius, and I was once an adventurer such as yourself.
I too, stumbled upon these caves, and wondered through the tunnels
below.  My tale is a sad one though.  Five of us wondered down below
seeking riches, and treasures.  WHowever, we were not prepared to face
the horrors which we were to encounter.  Five of us entered, four of 
us died.  I alone managed to escape alive.  I warn you now, that there
are horrors below which are too evil and hideous to discribe.  Leave
now, and live a long life.  If you do not heed my warning, and you
go down that ladder, know that you are either very courageous, or
a fool.  My the Gods watch over you.
                                
                                     Darius
