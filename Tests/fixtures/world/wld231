Before a Small Temple~
You are standing before a nice looking building. All around here you see birds 
chirping, the sun shining, and everything seems fine and dandy. Man, what a beautiful
day it is today.

Inside the temple~
You are inside the living area of the temple. You see a television set, and it is 
turned on. You see a beautiful, silver haired woman sitting down infront of the TV.
She turns around, looks at you, licks her lips and smiles.

You are now inside a bedroom inside the house. You see two people over in one corner.
One of them is a guy who looks too shy to put the moves on a lovely woman that's 
sitting next to him. You think that guy's a loser and that woman can do better than 
that. Watch you don't overuse your cologne.....

Deep inside Deep 13~


  You are inside a control room.  All around you there is junk lying
  around... possibly failed experiments?  There are two goofy guys
  looking at a monitor in one corner of the room.  You see what 
  appears to be a jail cell to the east.  The guys seem to be watching
  a man with two robots watching a movie.

In front of Furinkan High School.~
You stand before the gates of Furinkan High School. Standing in front of the gate 
is a young man, who just seems to be reciting poetry to himself. He also seems 
to be planning something, and looks like a fair fighter. He might not let you 
pass, so maybe you could force your way past him.

getting from one class to the next. This school doesn't seem too orderly, at least 
not yet. You wonder what type of person runs a school like this. The students 
on this floor don't seem very disciplined. Oh, make sure you close the door behind 
you. We don't want too many students leaving and cutting class now do we?

to this. That, or you can just ignore in and keep going.

that a boy in high-school is too young to be married, but you don't really 
understand the truth behind it.

Inside the Tendo Training Area.~
You are now inside the training area that many students have used to hone their
skills with over the years. You see a shadow on the wall doing some nice looking 
martial arts moves. The person seems rather skilled, and can possible take anyone
in a fight. Looks like the person needs an opponent to hone her skills on.

Inside the Tendo's home.~
You are now inside the Tendo home. You hear a girl fighting something in
the training area to the west of you. She sounds like she's pretty tough, 
good thing the door is closed. The place warrants a look-see.

At the entrance to the Tendo Anything Goes School of Martial Arts.~
You stand before the building. It seems to be a combination house and dojo. 
You know there are occupants inside the building, since you hear noises 
coming from inside. Maybe you can take a look around.

On a street. ~
You continue walking down the street, and notice that you are not too far away 
from that large house you noticed before. The house is not too far to the east 
of you, and the street continues back to the west.

A field.~
You stand underneath a giant tree that gives off a nice shade. It's a nice 
place to relax after a hard day, but with what goes on around here it is awfully
tough to have nerves of steel.

A field. ~
You see three angry young girls surrounding an old man. The old man is cackling
with insane glee as he holds a bag containing womens panties. You wonder why the
old man has such a wierd fetish. Maybe he's a crossdresser or something. The 
girls you see have every right to be mad at this old man.

shade.

A field.~
You stand in a grassy field. There seems to be a sick laughter coming from the 
north. The way back to the main street is to the south, and the field continues
to the north.

On a street~

to the north. Well, it's not all that quiet, as you hear some girls screaming 
and an old man laughing. The street continues to the east and west.

Ukyou's Okonomiyaki Restaurant.~
Ah.. So this is where the nice scent is comig from. You walk 
inside the restaurant and notice some happy customers chowing 
down on their lunch. Behind the counter you see a pretty 
girl cooking up what appears to be pancakes. She seems like she
can't keep up with the orders.

On a beach~
You walk along a quiet beach, when you suddenly see a figure lying in the sand.
The figure appears to be a lovely woman getting a suntan. As you approach her she 
turns around, looks at you, and smiles. Her eyes make your heart flutter, and her 
jet black hair shines in the sunlight. As she licks her lips and smiles at you a 
giant shadow comes over you. As you look up you see a foot of a giant Gundam Mech
coming toward you at an amazing speed. You try to move out of the way, but it is 
too late. The foot of the giant robot is on top of you, and the last thing you hear 
is the woman laughing at you.
SSSSSSSSSQQQQQQUUUUUUUUIIIIIIISSSSSSSSSSHHHHHH! you're flat as a bug!

Inside a hallway in the Temple~
You are in a rather small hallway, with a door to the north. This hallway 
looks like it can only fit one person at a time, and if one is claustrophobic,
it might not be a good idea to wander around inside this hallway for a long
period of time.

Inside a hallway~
You are walking inside a hallway in this temple. This hallway isn't too
big, and can fit one person at a time. There is a room to the north of
you, and you hear a woman's voice coming from that direction.

Before the mighty Kefka~
You head towards your final destination, when all of a sudden you hear a very
loud cackle that makes you shiver all over. The cackle is loud enough so that 
the ground crumbles below you! If you are not flying...... Well it is a very long
drop to your doom. The rocks below you seems like they are jagged and can 
impale anybody, even people with the strongest armor.

The Void!~
This is a very odd place.... This place is where Kefka stashes all the 
rotting corpses of players he's killed in the past. All around you there
is a terrible smell of all the rotting corpses and skeletons of these 
poor adventures. The blood stained walls send a shiver up and down your
spine. If you are not careful this is where your corpse might end 
up in the near future
