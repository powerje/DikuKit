{CYAN}Entrance to the city{b}~
   A large beautiful gate has been carved into the mountian to protect
the city within. Beyond the gate you can hear the normal hustle and bustle
of city life. Above the gate there is a sign which states Go AWAY!, 
you wonder what dinok means in the Dwarven language. The road continues south 
towards the wilderness and north into the city.

{Y}Sand Avenue{b}~
   This street is called sand street, not because it is made of sand but because it is
covered with dust from the mines. You nearly choke from the dust kicked up from your 
feet.  To the east is Copper Street and to the west is Adamantine Street.

{BOLD,BLACK}The Mining Dwarf{b}~
    You squeeze your way through the crowded bar. There are at least a hundred
people here. All drinking, shouting, and smoking, you wonder how this place 
stays in one piece. As you walk up to the bar a burley looking fellow asks you 
what you would like to drink.

{BOLD,BLACK}Mining Supply Store{b}~
   From Pick-Axes to dynomite this place has everything you need to mine! This place is crowded,
I guess mining is a popular profession around here. Oh, You ARE in a mountain. A grumpy dwarf
walks up to you and asks, "What the HELL do you want?". So much for friendly service. There is
an exit to the east towards Admantine Street.

{BOLD,BLACK}The Disappearing Dwarf Magic Shop{c}~
   Wow! What a neat shop! This place has everything, from dragons scales to newt eyeballs. 
The only downside to the shop is it smells like something died in here. The only way out 
is to the west, from whence you came.

{BOLD,BLACK}Armour R' Us{b}~
   There are all sorts of armor here, from dragon scale to silver woven. As you look around
you notice the shopkeeper eyeing you suspiciously, the thought of stealing something evades
your mind. This armor looks to be of great quility, maybe you should buy something? There is 
a door leading west to Adamantine Street.

{BOLD,BLACK}Mystical Pets{b}~
   This place is not your ordinary pet shop. You don't remember any pet shops selling baby 
dragons or gargoyles where you lived at. You wonder if they are tame enough to pet, I wouldn't 
find out if I were you. A strange looking animal eyes you from its cage, as you step closer to 
it the shopkeeper says "I wouldn't get to much closer if I were you. I once saw it rip a giants 
head off.".

{BOLD,BLACK}The Pick Axe Inn{b}~
   This place is a lot nicer the establishment on the other side of the city. Its 
floors are squeaky clean and you can nearly see your face in them. A chandler hangs 
from the ceiling and a long red carpet is rolled along the floor. A nice man behind the 
front desk asks you if you need anything.

The Flaming Forge~
     This place is one of the nicer forges you have seen in awhile. There is a large
anvil and forge in the corner of the room. A full suit of armor sits by the doorway
greeting you. While large axes, swords, and other weapons line the walls. Perhaps you 
should get your armor checked while you are here? The only exit is to the east into
Silver Street.

{BOLD,BLACK}The Second Diku Bank{b}~

   Wow! This place looks like it has enough armed guards to defend the city from invaders. 
A guard eyes you suspiciously while you stand in line to do your banking needs. I bet he 
would decapitate you if you even sneezed. I wouldn't want to find out. Once you finally get 
up to the window, a snobby looking female asks, "What can *I* do for *YOU*?".

   Smells of fresh baked pastries make your mouth water and your stomach growl with hunger. 
A large fat Chef stands behind the counter cooking up a storm, he casually asks what you 
would like, without even taking his eyes off the food he is preparing.

{BOLD,BLACK}The Apothecary{b}~
   Fragrant smells of different herbs fill the air in this shop. In the corner a black pot
boils over with a liquid substance. As it hits the ground it disappears in a poof of smoke.
You wonder what it does? Is it good or is it bad? Maybe you should go take a sip and find 
out!

hanging on the back wall, I'd hate to work here all day. Besides the smell, this place has some
beautiful leather armor and wares.  Maybe you should buy something?

{BOLD,BLACK}Gorn's Trinket Shop{b}~
   What a neat place! There must be  hundreds of trinkets lining the walls here. Some of this
stuff is useless crap while other are quite useful. The hard part is finding something useful in
this mess. A fat short dwarf sits behind the counter, you assume it is Gorn (Hence the name 
Gorn's Trinket Shop). The only exit is to the east where you came from.

{BOLD,BLACK}The Dwarven Guard Headquarters{b}~
   This place looks well guarded, you make this inference based on the fact that there
are at least ten guards walking around here in full armor. As you walk in here one of the
guards stop you and asks you what do you want and where is your id. Some Stairs led downward
while a door is to the east.

clearly states not to read any of the scrolls without proper training or to suffer the 
consequences of reading it wrong.  Maybe you should not touch anything. The shopkeeper 
looks like a mean one too.

should buy a few?

{RED}Entrance to the Warriors Guild{b}~
   From the stone floor to the picture of the impaled Giant on the wall, you can tell the people
who run this guild do not have very good taste in dcor. Two burley guys stand in the corner of
this room. They seem to be the guards of the guild. Just be quiet and hope they don't notice you.
There's some stairs to the north and the exit is to the west.

   As you enter a scarcely clothed bald guy bows before you and says, "Welcome". This room is
quite boring, there are no furniture or any other items as matter of fact, except a large 
stone idle and a pillow to sit on. What a bunch of freaks! Where is the Radio or the TV? Blah!

   What a grand place this is, from the golden statues to the elebrate woven carpets. I wonder
where these healers get their money? Don't they take a vow of poverty or something? They must
get a lot of donations around here. A small doorway is to the north. The exit to the street is
southward.

is posted on the wall stating that those who do not have bussiness with the Mage Guild will be
punished and/or killed. Maybe you shouldn't continue?

   This place is dark. You can barely see two feet in front of you. But from what you
can see, this place is filled with shady characters. You can hear hushed whispers in 
the corner. I would keep an eye on your gold pouch if I were you. An outline of a door 
can be seen behind the bar.

working on their warrior skills here. A large burly man seems to be the guild master, maybe 
you should talk to him about training?

 This has to be the most boring guild hall you have ever seen. The most excitement these guys
probably see in a day is when a fly lands on their nose while praying. A old dwarf is walking 
around over seeing the prayer.

   The Clerics that live in this town seem to worship the god Majere, as everyone should. 
They have pictures of the mighty god hanging all over the walls, and what looks like an 
altar in the corner of the room. The elder guildmaster eyes you as you walk around the room.

   This place is queer. You have an unsettling feeling standing in this room. Could it 
be the altar to satan in the corner of the room? Or is it the man hanging upsidedown by 
his intestents? The guildmaster doesn't seem to notice you.

  This place is dark and shadowy. The people in this room seem to fade in and out of the
shadows as they move. In the corner there is a chest full of gold, more then likely stolen.
You notice a shadowy figure eyeing you from the shadows, he probably is the guildmaster.

{BOLD,WHITE}
If I could stick my pen in my heart 
And spill it all over the stage 
Would it satisfy ya, would it slide on by ya 
Would you think the boy is strange? Ain't he strange? 

If I could win ya, if I could sing ya 
A love song so divine 
Would it be enough for your cheating heart 
If I broke down and cried? If I cried?

I said I know it's only rock 'n roll but I like it 
I know it's only rock 'n roll but I like it, like it, yes, I do 
Oh, well, I like it, I like it, I like it 
I said can't you see that this old boy has been a lonely?
