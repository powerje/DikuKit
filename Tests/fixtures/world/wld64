Pathway to the Burtons' Mansion~
You are standing on an expensively paved pathway, it is pure crushed quartz,
with cement in with it so it sticks together.  Far off to your north you see
a tall mansion, it stands above all the rest of the mansions on this island
except for one, this one is farther north, behind it.  It is big and blue, 
you wonder who lives in either mansion, they sure must be rich.

Dead Pass~
This is Simone street, but when you turned, the name changed.  It has now
gone into the woods, and is sufficiently more deserted.. This place gives
you the spooks, especially on foot, it might be a good idea to go back,
while you have the chance, you have survived the tough, but the tough, can
get tougher ... ... ..

Coming to a Trailer~
You have now just come off dead pass, and pass under a large tree trunk which
has fallen over another, which makes a weird X to the sides of the road. You
smell something foul, and it appears to be coming from the direction of that
tan and white trailor over there... damn, does that stink!

Next to the Trailer~
You are next to this very foul-smelling trailer.  It appears there is some 
disturbance to the leaves on the ground below you and the trailer, maybe
you should check this out.

In a Hole in the Ground~
There are many dead bodies in this hole, some of them half-rotten.  You 
see a slightly more fresh body of what appears to be a woman in her middle
age, that is sort of sad .. :(

In the Trailer of Stench~
As you walk in this trailer, you see dead things all over.  There are a 
number of what appear to be blood-drained rats lying on the floor, rotting.
There is also a small collection of food, clothing, trash, and a little 
box with some worthless trinkets.  There are pictures of someone all over
the walls, some tall guy with brown hair is in all of them, but in some of
them there are also 1 or 2 other men.  One is short, and black-haired, the 
other is slightly taller, and blond-haired.

Going up the Stairs~
You are walking up some medium-sized lavender-carpeted stairs.  As you walk
up, you feel a sense of relief that you killed, and rid of that evil little 
doll, although, it makes you wonder, if that doll isnt the last ... then ..

You are walking down a small hallway, which leads to a door at the end, there

In Roscoe's Room~
There is a big fight going on in this room, 4 people all fighting, blood 
flying. You better get outta here, fast.  One of them pulls out a gun, 
shoots another one in the face 6 times, and runs, with apparently his wife
or girlfriend.
