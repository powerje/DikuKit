{C}  Rukbat in the Sagittarian sector was a golden G-type star.
{C}  It had 5 planets and 1 stray. The third planet from the sun
{C}  possessed air, water, and gravity. Man soon colonized this
{C}  planet. Eventually, over the years, man forgot where he came
{C}  from and the settlers were left to fend for themselves.{b}
