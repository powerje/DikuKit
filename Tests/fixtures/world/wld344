{BOLD,RED}Welcome{BOLD,MAGENTA} To {BOLD,RED}The {BOLD,MAGENTA}Points!{bold,magenta}~

   {BOLD,CYAN}Here you are! {BOLD,RED}{BLINK}The  Five  Points{blink}{BOLD,CYAN}! New York's, and  arguably
   the entire nation's, most wretched  slums. {BOLD,RED}The Five Points{BOLD,CYAN}
   is called as  it is because of  the points  created by the
   intersection of  Anthony, Orange, and Cross Streets. There
   is {BOLD,GREEN}Paradise  Square{BOLD,CYAN}, which is the heart of the Five Points
   and is located between  Anthony and Cross. There are  many
   gangs that frequent {BOLD,RED}the Five Points{BOLD,CYAN}, and I'm sure you will 
   become  quite  acquainted  with them as  you  explore  the
   points. Where  you  are standing  now used to be  a  lake, 
   called  The  Collect.  However,  the  Street  Commissioner
   recently decided to fill in the pond, which  had been used
   to hold waste, and turn it into... {BOLD,RED}the Five  Points{BOLD,CYAN}. Enjoy 
   your stay!{bold,cyan}

{BOLD,YELLOW}Walking the streets of the {BOLD,RED}Five Points{bold,red}~
   
   {BOLD,RED}As  you cross  the  street, your eyes begin to wander across 
   the slums that have taken up  the scenery. The air  has gone
   from a crisp  and fresh  state to  one filled with pollution. 
   One can taste the debauchery on the tip of his or her tongue
   walking  through  the  Five  Points. This  is  the epitome of 
   corruption. The streets are lined with beggars, prostitutes, 
   thugs, and even a corpse or two. You walk the street, keeping 
   your eyes lowered as to not make trouble with the wrong crowd.
   As you pass the whores, you are temped to sneak a glance over, 
   knowing  full well  that at least one  of them is showing her 
   goods, attempting to entice you to a night of what the people
   of the Five Points call... "fun".

{BOLD,GREEN}Inside the {BOLD,BLACK}Plug{bold,black} {WHITE}Uglies{BOLD,GREEN} card {BOLD,YELLOW}game{bold,yellow}~

   {GREEN}As you open the  door and  enter the  room, you are
   greeted by two  members  of  the {BOLD,BLACK}Plug{bold,black}{WHITE}  Uglies{white}. {GREEN}They {GREEN}
   stand in front of the doorway, side  by  side, with
   their arms  crossed over  their chest  in a  rather 
   intimidating  manner. This  room  is  rather  bare,
   the  walls, floor, and ceiling all made of decaying
   wood and void of any  decorations. There is an aura 
   of excitement and intense  competition in the room,
   as these card {BOLD,YELLOW}games{bold,yellow}{GREEN} are {BOLD,RED}illegal{bold,red}{GREEN} and always bring an
   element of {BOLD,RED}danger{bold,red}{GREEN}  to one's life. To  the east, you
   hear the music coming from the gaming room. To  the 
   south, the  noise of  every day street  life can be
   heard.{green}

{BOLD,GREEN}On your way to the {BOLD,BLACK}Plug{bold,black}{WHITE} Uglies {BOLD,GREEN}card {BOLD,YELLOW}game{bold,yellow}~

   {GREEN}The condition of this room is not much better than 
   the one you were just in  moments before. The wood 
   that  surrounds you  is still {BOLD,GREEN}decaying{bold,green}{GREEN}, giving  an 
   unpleasant  scent and  making the air  around  you 
   uncomfortably  humid. To  the  left   side of  the 
   hallway, there  is  a  small  plank  in the  floor 
   missing. You gaze down  into the hole and notice a
   half  dozen  or so {BOLD,WHITE}bones{bold,white}{GREEN}. You had no idea that the 
   {BOLD,BLACK}Plug{bold,black}{WHITE} Uglies{GREEN}  were so... {BOLD,RED}murderous{bold,red}{GREEN}! Maybe this card
   {BOLD,YELLOW}game {bold,yellow}{GREEN}isn't the best idea.

{BOLD,GREEN}In the middle of the {BOLD,BLACK}Plug{bold,black}{WHITE} Uglies{BOLD,GREEN} card {BOLD,YELLOW}game{bold,yellow}~

   {BOLD,GREEN}You are now  in the midst of a high-stakes card game
   being ran by the {BOLD,BLACK} Plug {bold,black}{WHITE}Uglies{BOLD,GREEN}. A large table sits in 
   the middle of the  room, surrounded  by a half dozen 
   men. All of the  players  don't give you  any notice 
   as you enter, all being too entranced in their hand.
   {BOLD,CYAN}Bottles of alcohol{BOLD,GREEN} can be seen  within grasp of each
   participant and the slurs  coming from  their mouths
   are  very  blatant. You notice  one empty chair  and 
   wonder where that person went off to. Your questions
   are  answered  when  you  see  an  {BOLD,RED}unconscious  body {bold,red}{BOLD,GREEN}
   sprawled  out  on the  floor, a broken  beer  bottle 
   shattered around his head.{bold,green}
