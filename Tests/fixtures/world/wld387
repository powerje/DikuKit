{W}In Front of an Old, Condemned Building{w}~
 
   A large, neglected building stands before you.  The
   walls are covered in faded {BLU}g{blu}{RED}r{red}{WHI}a{whi}{CYAN,BO}f{cyan,bo}{BLACK}f{black}{YEL,BOL}i{yel,bol}{MAGENTA}t{magenta}{GREEN,BO}i{gree,bo}, and the old
   bricks are chipped and cracked.  There is a set of
   {CY,BO}glass doors{cy,bo} in front of you, but there's so much grime
   caked on the glass that you can't see inside.
  
   A broken sign above the door barely reads:
        {YEL,BO}M{yel,bo} {YELL}dg{yell}{YEL,BOLD}a{yel,bo}  {WHITE}r{white}  {RED}Ar{red} {RED,BO}a{red,bo}{RED}d{red}{WHITE}e{white}

Welcome to the {YELLOW,BOLD}Midgaard{yellow,bold} {RED,BOLD}Arcade{red,bold}~
 
   So this is the old {Y,BO}Midgaard{y,bo} {R,BO}Arcade{r,bo}!  It's seen better
   days, though it appears that the old {R}video game{r} machines
   are still in operation, albeit somewhat cobweb-covered
   and dusty.  You could probably dig up an old, familiar
   favorite if you look hard enough.
 
   It would probably help to find some {G,BO}game tokens{g,bo}, if
   you want to play any of the games.

   There appears to be a tiny, scale-model city here.  The
   miniscule buildings stand at eye-level, and massive 
   skyscrapers barely higher than that.  It's remarkably
   life-like; even those tiny little people scrambling
   about on the street below!  Holy smokes, this isn't
   some model replica town, it's a real city!  That means

   ahead, you can see a huge crater.  It's so big,
   you'd probably need to fly to get across it!

Jumping Over the Crater!~
 
   Flying slowly across the crater, you notice alot
   of jagged rocks at the bottom.  It's a good thing
   you can fly, cause those rocks look like they 
   could have been a death trap.

Driving on the Moon~
 
   After a serene low-gravity flight over that crater,
   you touch down on the moon surface.  Puffs of moon
   dust kick up as your feet contact the ground.  Up
   ahead, there seems to be more trouble.  But beyond
   that, you can almost make out the end of your 
   journey.

   Stalk-like buildings with globular tops can be
   seen all around you.  Some sort of parking 
   garage is also here, and you can see a strange,
   purple dune buggy of some sort here.

   Turning your attention backed to the Masked Ninja,
   you're shocked to find yourself face-to-face with
   another ninja!  He's dressed all in grey, but isn't
   wearing a mask.  He eyes you with a look of caution
   as he draws his weapon to confront you!

Running the {RED}Gauntlet{red}~
 
   This is a pretty bland-looking maze.  It's so boring!
   The only thing that keeps things interesting is the
   horde of monsters coming at you!

Dead End~
 
   You could have sworn this was the right way!  Did
   you go left, when you were supposed to go right?
   
   It's all so confusing!  Which way is out?!

Dead End~
 
   You could have sworn this was the right way!  It 
   looks like you must have gotten confused, because
   this certainly isn't the way out.
 
   Looks like you'll have to find another way.

Another Dead End~
 
   Oh great, another dead-end!  Looks like you'll have to
   turn back again.  But wait!  You see a nice little
   exit portal in the corner of the room!  Maybe you can
   get out through there.
