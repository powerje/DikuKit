The end of the hallway~
  You are at the end of a long dark hallway. The darkness here is almost
tangable in its thickness. A deep sense of fear and loathing comes over
you.
  A pair of obsidian doors can be seen to the east.

The chamber of darkness~
  You are in a vast chamber. The walls fade into darkness, leaving you
with a very vague idea of the actual size of the room. Swirling here and
there in the dark, are patches of pure black which seem to suck in your
light and leave it that much darker here.

Torture chamber~
  You are in an ill lit chamber. Intruments of torture hang from a rack
on the wall, they seem to quiver with anticipation of a victim as if they
had a mind of their own. An operating table is here, though it is bare.
  An extreme feeling of evil permeates the entire area.

The inner chamber~
  You are in a small dark chamber. Upon the walls are glowing sigils of
dark power, scrawled and traced in an evil language no longer known to most
of this plane of existance. There is an obsidian altar here which seem to
glow, but does not shed any light, in fact it seems to be taking light in.

are a milky white color, and glow with a warm luminescence, as does the
floor. A feeling of goodness permeates the area, and you feel unworthy to

  You are in a small antechamber. It is well lit here, though the source
of light cannot be seen. It is almost as if the room itself exudes a warm
glow of goodness. A larger chamber can be seen to the west, but you do not
feel worthy to pass into it.

The chamber of the white light~
  You are in a vast chamber, its walls floor and ceiling are of an unknown
metalic material, the brightest white, almost blindingly stark. A flickering
flame is in the center of the room, seeming to feed off of darkness and
cleansing the room of any evil. You feel a slight tug at your being as the
flame flickers towards you.

mess all around them, the master of this chamber obviously can.

the walls, and the floor is covered with a plush multicolored carpet, which
seems to rustle and move at the touch of your boots.

The audience chamber~
  You are in a large chamber. Small bolts of energy leap from wall to wall,
crackling with power. The floor is a swirl of indeterminable colors and
paterns ever changing. Bright bursts of color seem to explode into the air
and fade again at random times. All this splender plays about and draws
attention to a large throne in the center of the room, it seems to be cut
from a single enormous emerald.

shelves which span every wall. A large oaken writing table is in the center
of the room with odd papers and parchments on it. The illumination here,
to your supprise is a quite un-magical oil lamp.

altar. Many icons to lesser dieties line the room, but it is obvious by one
glance at the symbols on the altar, that this room was designed for the
worship of Mystra, the goddess of magic.

A passage~
  You are in a small dark passage, which would be unremarkable if not for
the fact that it ends in a blindling blue light to the west. On hooks set
into the wall here there hangs several travel worthy cloaks, and a small
leather backpack.  It looks as if someone has prepared this room to be used
in the event speedy evacuation.

In the light~
  You seem to be floating in a magical energy field, though you cannot see
the source of the energy, you can feel its power pushing at you from all
sides, completely negating the effects of gravity.
  An imperfection in the uniform blue can be seen overhead, it might be an
exit.
