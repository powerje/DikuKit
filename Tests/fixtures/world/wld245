   You enter a world in which it seems the theme is decay. There was once
a massive field of wild flowers and trees but today there is only decay
and death. You are snapped out of your melancholy however by some large
orcs that you can see laying siege to a massive fortress to the west.

   You wander through what must have been at one point a thriving field.
You can see the remains of a river up ahead and realize that it must have 
fed a huge field of beautiful flowers and trees. Now the field is just
dried up clumps of dirt and stumps. The river must have dried up a very 
long time ago.

   The walls of the fortress seem impossibly thick and look like they
reach up to the sky. You are reminded of the ancient walled cities of the 
Egyptian era. It is amazing that anyone would even dare to try an attack
on this well protected castle but that didn't seem to stop the orcs. They 
are all over the place and seem to be in good spirits. Somehow that fact
does not make you feel overly confident.

   There is a turn here in this dried up river bed. It looks as though 
the river had a bend here that went to the north and to the west. It 
doesn't seem that anything is left alive here. It looks as though there
was alot of life on this river at one point but that must have been a 
very very long time ago.

   You are wandering up the remains of what used to be a river bed. Up 
ahead you can see what looks like it used to be a massive waterfall. This 
must have been a very impressive force of nature when water flowed along
it. The lack of water makes you wonder how people can survive here.

   This is a dead end. You have come to a massive stone wall. It looks as
though this was the middle part of a waterfall. The wall reaches up as far
as the eye can see. You are convinced that there is no way that anyone
can physically get up to the top even with spells. The only thing that you
can do is turn around and see what else is here.

   You are at the end of the road. You stand at the edge of a precipice
that is uncrossable. The cliff looks as if it goes down for miles. You 
had better get away from the edge before your queasy stomach gets the 
better of you.

   You stand just inside the shattered gates in the fortress of Tarlequin.
Now you can see why the orcs had a confident look on their faces. The door
that used to be where you are standing looks as though it had been 
battered for centuries. I guess that everything must give way at some 
point. Unfortunately for the inhabitants inside, the orcs look as though
this is something they have been waiting for for a very long time.

   The courtyard here is littered with the bloody corpses of the former
inhabitants of the fortress. It looks as though the orcs have taken the
task of extermination with great vigor. Wherever you look there are bodies
filled with all manner of weaponry from spears to axes. The few souls that
were unfortunate enough to live through the first attack are soon silenced
by the waiting blades of the orcs that seem to unendingly pour through
the gaping hole in the wall.

   There is a small opening in the west wall here. It seems to be a grand

been before all of this carnage and bloodshed. It seems the only people to
have witnessed the grandeur are lying in pools of their own blood.

   You walk up a hallway to what must be a central meeting chamber of some
sort. The walls here are lined with old tapestries and all manner of

mind wanders back to the chaos outside as a shiver down your spine.

   This is the throne room of the once proud Tarlequin King. You can see
him sitting on his throne with a sad look on his face. It is as if the 
heavy burden of what is happening outside has fallen on his shoulders. It 
is with a heavy heart that he cannot stop what has happened but from the
slowly building look of anger on his face, you are sure that there will 
be many orcs playing at the end of his sword.

   You have entered a deep underground cavern. There is no light save the
one that you brought. The thought of being trapped down here with no 
light fills you with a feeling of dread. The feeling becomes more of a 
gnawing in your gut when you get a closer look at your surroundings. All 
around you lie the bones of the dead. They litter the floors in piles 
as if they were placed there. One more thing gets to you...all the bones 
look as though they have been picked clean.

   You see more bones littering the floor in here. These appear to be
picked clean too. You are startled by a low drumming sound. Was that 
a slight moaning sound coming from the cavern below you just heard or 
was that just your imagination? Your heart begins to race a little quicker
but you must keep a cool head. It must have been just your mind playing 
tricks on you...or was it?

   Dark and foreboding, the caverns you are in offer little in the way
of comfort to the adventurer. The dull sound of moaning permeates the
entire area. It is very hard to tell what direction the sounds are coming
from though because they seem to bounce off the walls. You are pretty sure
that you will meet whatever is making those sounds very soon though as you
look up ahead and see glowing red dots moving towards you.

   The creatures here seem to wander the corridors aimlessly. That is

   The creatures here seem to wander the corridors aimlessly. That is 
until they get the scent of human flesh. It is then that you can see the 
fire of recognition burning in their eyes. They want you to join them in 
their dance of death. You can only imagine how many adventurers must have 
fallen victim to their overwhelming numbers.

   The creatures that inhabit these caverns must prey on each other to 
stay alive. It makes you wonder if the bones that litter the floor are of
fellow adventurers like yourself. The question is who are they and how did
they come to be here. It doesn't seem likely that they are the result of
anything natural either. Perhaps they are the accidental result of some
experiment gone wrong. Or worse, perhaps they are the end result of a mage
that has gone mad.

   You come across what can only be the source of all the undeath roaming
the corridors. There is an alchemical lab of sorts in this room. There
powders and liquids and tomes and scrolls just littering every corner of
this place. You can see a mage working on some form of experiment off in
the far corner. That must be why he hasn't seen you yet. Taking a closer
look you can see a corpse lying on the table. The mage starts to pour some
liquid on the head and chants a few words. In a moment the corpse screams
out in pain. It is then that the mage finally notices that you are there
and tells his new pet that you are lunch!

   You are enshrouded by a heavy fog. You can barely make out the hand
in front of your face. Did something just brush by your leg? You are
starting to feel unnerved as a faint but persistent hissing sound
starts to reverberate throughout the area. Whatever that sound is, you
can bet that it isn't friendly. You also know that if it has any
friends that they now know that you are here as well.

   As you wander around in this plain of nightmares, the fog does not 
seem to dissapate in the slighest. It parts easily enough in front of 
you and then closes behind like a door slamming shut on your escape 
route. You keep getting the feeling like you are being watched by 
hundreds of unseen eyes. Was that something rubbing past your leg?? 
The hissing sound gets louder and louder the further you go. It 
reminds you a bit of snakes, but you hope that is not the case. You 
can only hope that it is something else because it would take an awful 
lot of them to make this kind of noise.

   You have entered one of the training chambers of the acolytes of
the Viper God. Recruits that are deemed worthy must pass this final 
test to prove their worth to their god. They must somehow make it 
passed the one that trained them in the arts of the snake. When they
can do that then they can speak to the Shaman to become a true acolyte
and start their journey down the serpent road. If they don't then they
will be transformed to the nightmare beasts that you passed to get here.

   As you wander around in this plain of nightmares, the fog does not 
seem to dissapate in the slighest. It parts easily enough in front of 
you and then closes behind like a door slamming shut on your escape 
route. You keep getting the feeling like you are being watched by 
hundreds of unseen eyes. Was that something rubbing past your leg?? 
The hissing sound gets louder and louder the further you go. It 
reminds you a bit of snakes, but you hope that is not the case. You 
can only hope that it is something else because it would take an awful 
lot of them to make this kind of noise.

   You have entered one of the training chambers of the acolytes of
the Viper God. Recruits that are deemed worthy must pass this final 
test to prove their worth to their god. They must somehow make it 
passed the one that trained them in the arts of the snake. When they
can do that then they can speak to the Shaman to become a true acolyte
and start their journey down the serpent road. If they don't then they
will be transformed into the nightmare beasts you passed to get here.

   You have entered a grand chamber. Golden statuaries of Cobras and
Boa Contrictors and Pit Vipers adorn the walls of this chamber. Along
the opposite wall is a massive throne of emerald and gold. You can tell
by the grandiose nature of the room that only the truly worthy make it
into this chamber. A moment later, you can sense a great power beginning
to form on the throne. It takes but a brief second for the power to
fully take form. You almost wish that it hadn't as you now are looking
face to face with a very old and very powerful looking man in robes.
This must be the Viper Shaman.  {b}

   You appear to be at the entrance of a massive colliseum. It looks like
the colliseum that Roman gladiators fought toe to toe at in ancient Rome.
There are literally hundreds of people milling around waiting for the 
festivities to begin. There are several burly men wandering over to an
entrance in the side of the structure. Maybe if you follow them you can see
what is going on here.

{C}
   That wasn't a visitor's entrance at all. Those burly men must have been 
combatants in whatever event is going on here today. Just to the east you
can make out the floor of this massive colliseum where all the action takes
place. You can see that some of the preliminary combats have already begun
but they are still too far away to see who or what is fighting. You get 
the feeling like no one would know if you went out there or not. Maybe you
can join in on the fun if you have a desire to.
