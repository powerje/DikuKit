       Welcome to the creation school.  It seems you 
   have figured out quite easily how to view the 
   additional topics.  Keep an eye on them as they will 
   provide extended information on creation topics as

   Good luck in your quest for knowledge and experience.

theme~
   
                {BO,W,UND}  Section 1: Theme + Target   {bo,W}
       Before you tell yourself that the theme you have in mind for your
   zone is good enough, you might want to read through this section.  
   It might just save you the hassles you'll face if the theme you thought
   would work out well flops.
       The theme of your zone will make the difference between headaches, 
   giving up, and frustration and quick creating, satisfaction with what 
   you've made, and quick, easily approved zone reviews.  
       This section will help you in deciding a strong theme that you 
   will be able to work with, as well as a good target for your zone.
   I can not stress the importance of this section enough, as a good
   choice will make the creating proccess a very smooth ride and a 
   bad one...frustration.

    {BO,W,UND}   Why NOT to Make an Advanced Zone   {bo,W}
-There are already tons of advanced zones.
-It is more time consuming to make an advanced zone as opposed 
 to some of the other types of zones.
-Advanced zones are reviewed the HARDEST.
-Nearly all of the eq stats you wanted will be changed before 
 the zone is open.
-You will have to spend hours upon end changing things so that 
 reviewers will approve.
-Your zone will either be too easy and everyone will yell at you 
 and lower the stats or limits of equipment, or too hard, in 
 which case no one will do the zone you spent a few hundred hours 
 working on.  
-As soon as your bad arse advanced zone with awesome equipment, a 
 dope theme, challenging beyond belief, innovative ideas, etc is 
 open, some other adv zone will be in the works with better eq 
 stats, etc.
                                 Be warned....
