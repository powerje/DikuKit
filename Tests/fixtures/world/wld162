{bo,Y}On The Shore{bo,y}~


  {bo,Y}As you wade toward the beach you hear strange birds call
  to each other from branches of unfamiliar trees, and colorful
  insects dance in the air.  Even the waves that tickle your 
  ankles seem to promise a thousand tales of darting fish 
  and scurrying crabs.{bo,y}

  {BO,C}A short trail takes you down to the plateau.  Stone ruins

  shadows of a huge ancient city.{bo,c}

  {bo,Y}The great dome of rock rises steeply from the plain, as if 
  a huge sphere had been driven halfway into the flat land. 
  The flesh colored granite rises hundreds of cubits into the
  air.  A narrow ledge angles from the base of the rock, 
  climbs upward fifty cubits and then fades into a hodge-podge
  of hand and footholds.  The Skithis will never be able to
  manage these slopes.{bo,y}

  {bo,BLACK}    
  A blast of warm air hits your face.  It is dank and 
  fetid, but whole and needed.  A dark shaft plunges 
  into the depths.  Rough stone stairs begin just on
  the other side of the door and spiral down inside of
  the pit.{bo,black}

  Reddish-yellow light fills the room.  Unlike the

  A horrendous rip in the floor of the cave glows
  with an unnatural light.  Molten rock churns in 
  the fissure, radiating fierce heat.  A thin sprout
  of water trickles down one wall into the tear, 
  filling the air with foul-smelling steam.{bo,r}

  a goblin off the ground.  It dangles the creature
  in the air, then tosses him into the fiery pit.{bo,r}

  {BO,C}An underground river moves swiftly past disappearing. 
  Everything is dark.  You cannot see.  you cannot 
  feel.  You are floating in water.  But you float 
  under the surface.  You can not breath!  You swim 
  for the surface.  Walls appear all around you!  
  You are trapped.  You lungs burn for air.  But
  there is no air.  The darkness becomes blacker-
   
  You cannot breath!  
             
             You cannot breath!
