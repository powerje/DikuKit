Room of Conversation and Stereo Blasting~
Wow, now this is a cool pad.  Maya spared no expense on this room.  This, the
main room of the huge beachhouse, was meant to be a private conversation area.
But Maya is just too friendly to have a soundproof room.  You see various CDs
cluttering the room.  There are some C.M.B. and Boys II Men albums here h
holding up one of the tables.  Hey what did you think they would be good for?
An incredibly powerful Dell Pentium 90 looms in the corner of the room.  Its
aura of powerful illuminates all around it.  The Dell is fully stocked since
Maya wouldn't settle for less than the best, it also has an ethernet card so
Maya will never get spammed off the mud.  An awesome pair of Carver hybrid
ribbon Amazing Platinum Edition speakers tower over everything in the room.
Maya usually likes to use them to rock the room, not to mention the whole
mud.  On the side of the room lies an altar where people can worship the
almighty himself.  You might wanna take a look at it.

altar~
This a small expensive altar with incense burning on it like mad.  A life-size
picture of the all powerful Forge rests in the center of the altar.  
                      WORSHIP AND BOW TO HIS GREATNESS!!!
