Shores of Latium~


  You leave your boats and swim for shore. You
  can see the warm sunny soaked sands of Latium.
  After your long voyage, you wish for nothing more 
  than dry land. As you swim towards the shore, you 
  see hundreds of Rutulians armed to the teeth.
  They're screaming at you while waving their weapons 
  high in the air. So much for a warm welcome.

Inland Latium~


  You've made it inland now. More warriors swarm around you. 
  They swing their mighty swords while snarling at you.
  Although they send shivers through your bones, these
  warriors seem to lack the discipline necessary to fight 
  effectively.

BATTLE!~


  A fierce battle is in process here. Bloody arms and
  legs flying about this place. The grass is sticky with 
  spilled blood. The battle seems to be very intense to 
  the north. To the west, a large castle towers over the 
  fields. Trumpets sound in the distance and to the east 
  you notice the camp of a wealthy warrior.

  You catch up with the fleeing man. His arms are 
  loaded with jewels and gold. As you grab him, he 
  turns. He is an old man, but you can tell by his
  bulging muscles that he was once a fierce warrior.
  The armor he wears is beautifully adorned and 
  glitters in the sunlight. You stare at it in awe 
  giving him time to draw his sword and prepare for 
  battle.

Up the Tower~


  You've now begun to ascend the tower. It twists 
  up and up and up until it fades from view. The 
  tremendous height of this tower makes you dizzy. 
  Your legs start to hurt as you continue to climb
  higher and higher. It is very cold in here.

Study~


  A slender man is sitting here at a table. He stops 
  writing and looks up at you with a smile. He is 
  dressed in typical Roman garb. He stands and walks 
  toward you. He raises his quill above his head. Ink 
  drips from its tip. He lowers it quickly trying to
  stab you!

Docks of Carthage~


  You are standing on the docks of Carthage. People
  are hurrying on and off ships. You spot your vessel.
  It's a beautiful ship with rows and rows of oars 
  sticking out of its sides. You move toward it and
  prepare to board.

  You find yourself in a secret hideaway within the

  look at various papers, but they are all in some
  language you can't comprehend. Buried under a stack

  words:

  You fall on your belly at the bottom of the mountain.
  Wow that was quite a slide. You're sure glad to be 
  past those goats too. They seemed a little supernatural.
  Now that you're here, you might as well look around.
  It seems that you've fallen off the deep end so to

On the Way to Your Death~


  You are heading down the road to your death. It must 
  really suck to be you. But then again, do you have 
  anything to live for? Why not just die and end this
  cruel existence?

TREASURE~


  You have found your treasure. Too bad you're insane
  and nutz. Also there is a big ugly monster guarding
  it. Maybe you should just kill yourself and be done
  with it. Would save the monster some time and 
  trouble.
