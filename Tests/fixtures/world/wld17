                          {RED,BOLD}This is the home
                       of the smurf's leader.
                 While it looks like he has simpler
            tastes than the others, Papa Smurf's home is
            still very nicely decorated.  He takes pride
                     {YELLOW}in his work. If Papa Smurf
                     is not here, he is over at
                     Smurfette's place, putting
                     ooo some moves on her. ooo

{MAGENTA,BOLD}Smurf{WHITE}ette'{YELLOW}s Home{b}~
  This house is conviently next to Papa Smurfs.  Makes it easier for Papa
Smurf to sneak over at night.  I hope he uses protection.  I would hate to
have little smurfs running around.  The only exit is to the east.
