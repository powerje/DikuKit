{BO,C}On The Drawbridge{bo,c}~

   You stand on the drawbridge leading into the Castle of
   Hearts.  Ahead lies a set of portcullis in the lowered
   position.  Below you is the moat.  No telling what
   fierce creatures inhabit those waters.

{BO,Y}In The Moat{bo,y}~

   You have plunged down into the moat.  The areas to
   your north and south are overgrown with weeds and seem
   impassable.  In both directions you can see a thick
   scaly trunk extending about the castle.  A large
   serpentine tail suddenly emerges from the water in
   front of you.  That can only mean that the head is

   who should already be aware of your place in the grand
   scheme of things.  Several noble personages are
   assembled about the room and within the gallery above.

   Perched upon a raised dais and set into the far wall
   is the throne of the King of Hearts.  It is encrusted
   with jewels and seems to be made of the purest gold. 
   Upon it sits the awesome figure of the King himself.
   Smiling, he beckons you to approach.  You dare not
   deny.

   Part of the outer wall stands here.  It is craggy and
   crumbling and appears that it may collapse at any
   moment without warning.

   Perched precariously at the peek of the most unstable
   segment sits a large egg.  It is painted the way
   Easter eggs are sometimes done, with a little costume
   and a big smiley face.  It rocks to and fro humming a
   careless tune.  Uh oh, looks like it is about to lose
   it's purchase.  Better hope that this is a hard boiled
   egg.
