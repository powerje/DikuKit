{Y,BO}
  As gentle waves roll in over the sand and wispy clouds 
  paint the blue skies above, thousands of tales stemming
  from the great sea stretched out before you fill your
  mind. Up shore, there are giant bones of an unidentified
  creature tipped in blood drying in the sun. You whince. 
  Perhaps, another tale for another day. But today, you
  embark on a journey some might call "a day at the beach".
  Offshore a distance you see it - the Isle of Dread!

  The higher the ladder climbs the more one
  can see of the tree dwellers camp though
  camp is not the best way to describe the
  sight. It is more of a village of small
  treehouses created in a style of simple
  beauty. Each is connected with wood plank
  and vine pathways. They are nothing like
  the tree forts children build in their 
  backyards.

The queen room~
  This looks like the room of the big queen of the Aranea. A small ladder leads
up to nowhere. *GASP*

{M}Tabbo Island{m}~
{M}
  Though this island doesn't look too much 
  unlike the Isle of Dread, there is something
  different about it. Birds are calling to
  one another in the background. Fragrant 
  flowers fill the salty air. This place
  seems a bit more pleasant.

{M}Tabbo Island{m}~
{M}
  This rocky island is dotted with ruins. A large 
  marble temple rises out of the volcanic mountain.
  The twisted pathway leading to the temple is lined
  with statues of the many gods and goddess. A small
  stone building with a jutting terrace crumbles in
  disrepair.

temple~
You can see a large ruin temple far in the distance. It's built into the side
of the mountain at the north of the island.

  With the view of the ruins to the west and 
  the beach to the south, you look to the north
  at the forest which partly obscures your view
  of the rest of the island.
