{C} 
   You are walking up what appears to be a rather well
traveled path. Ahead in the distance you can see a small
mountain with snow capped peaks. At the base of the mountain
you can just make out a small village of some kind. You are
going to have to get closer to get a better look. All in all
it is a majestic scene. It reminds you of a nature painting.

   From this close you can finally make out the village up ahead. Your
eyes must have been playing some tricks on you though because what you
thought was a small village at the base of a mountain is really more of
a small sized town. It's a bit funny that a town such as this would be
built in the woods without some kind of major road into or out of it.
Maybe the townsfolk wanted to keep the tourists to a minimum...

   Walking around you get the feeling that this is a quaint little town
with alot of what travel agents would call atmosphere. There are little 
shops that line the either side of the small thoroughfares. Everyone seems
to be friendly. They are all smiles and warm greetings. After a couple of
minutes of looking though you get the feeling like something is wrong.
The people seem to be in a bit of a daze. It is as if their minds are on 
other things as they wander around taking care of their daily chores. It
is as if the friendliness they show you is rehearsed.

   You wander the around the streets and come across shop after shop. They
seem to be frequented by quite a few people. This village must have quite 
a reputation indeed. However, you can't help but get the feeling that 
there is more to this place than meets the eye. Perhaps you are just being 
paranoid. There is a Talisman Shop to the east and a Virtual Reality 
Arcade to the west that looks like it just recently opened to the public.

   This is a new business that has just opened up. It is a small arcade 
that has a couple of the newest and hottest virtual reality games on the
market today. There are posters splattering the walls that depict what the
game might look like from the inside. The people that are coming out of the
games tell you that the posters don't do the games justice and that you 
should really try it. You can see several people by the games handing out
virtual reality goggles to the patrons. You might want to get in line and
give it a try. It might be fun.

of tiny vials filled with all manner of odd colored liquids
lining the walls. There are also skulls both ornamental and

deals with everything from minor enchantments and alchemy to
major spell research and demonology.

   A massive fountain sits directly in what must be the center of the 
village. The statue atop it looks to be some sort of dragon although it 
has been mutated into a thing of unspeakable evil. The artist made it 
breath fire and gave it six talon tipped arms. It makes you wonder why 
they put it in the center of their village, unless it was here to begin 
with. Seeing the statue, you are not surprised by the lack of peddlers 
carts in this area.

   The walls in this shop are covered with all manner of maps. There are
maps to some of the familiar areas that you know such as Midgaard and some
that don't seem familiar at all. The maps all have some sort of markings on
them that indicate places of interest to see or directions to some well
known merchant or shopkeeper. The mainstay of this shop seems to be selling
maps to well known and not so well known holy sites. This store must be 
fairly well known because they carry a great many maps that those souls on
spiritual quests could use to begin their journey or in some cases end it.

hard, polished surface of the big mahogany desk that stands in the

to figure out new ways to make himself rich. When he sees you he puts
on a smile that is as broad as his whole face.

   You have come to the end of the access road. The only thing ahead of
you is a small river. You notice on the side of the road the rotting 
remains of what looks to be an old bridge. Perhaps there was at one point
a way across the river, but it is long gone. That might explain why the
road hasn't been used in a very long time. The bridge must have broken 
and they just never bothered to fix it.

{B}Back Room of the Map Shop{b}~
{C}
   This room is very cluttered. There are numerous crates back here with
seals from different lands. This must be where Spanky keeps his inventory
of maps. There is a desk in the corner of all this chaos that seems a bit
out of place. It seems out of place because it is the only area back here
that is in immaculate condition. There is not a shred of dust or disarray to
be found in or around the desk. The only things on it are a small oil lamp
and what appears to be a very, very old piece of parchment.

   This is the stockroom for the shop up front. It seems odd 
though that there isn't very much stock considering all the

it doesn't look like this is used very much at all considering
the obvious business he does. You would think that there would
not be so much dirt and grime accumulated on the items back 
here.

  There seems to be a crack in the ceiling here. Upon closer
examination you can see that there is a small crevice that 
opens up into a larger area above. It looks as if you could
fit up there. You just need to clear out some rocks to make 
some room for you and your equipment to get through.

   Mists swirl and the echoed screams of the dead wrap their arms around you. You 
look around and are suddenly overcome by a wave of despair. You start to feel as
though there is nothing that you can do to overcome this feeling when you get a 
chill up the back of your spine. Suddenly, you break out of your doldrums and 
realize that this place could quite easily take you over if you aren't careful.
Looking around you can see other souls wandering about as if searching. Could this
be some sort of purgatory? Maybe it isn't such a good idea to be here.

{B}Through the Crevice in the Rock{b}~
{B} 
   As you enter this space you realize that it must have at
one time been a manmade room. There must have been a cave-in
or earthquake that filled the room with rock. When you sit 
to get a better look at your surroundings, you see the bones
of the dead poking out of points in the rock. There must have
been people in here when the disaster happened. Just when you
are about to leave, a gleam catches your eye. The shimmering
and unmistakable form of a partially buried portal sits near
one of the walls. Could this be an exit?
