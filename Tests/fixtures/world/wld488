{C,BO}The House of Christopher Robin{c,bo}~
{C,BO}
  Gazing upward, the two story white washed home greets the
  blue sky with its fluffy white clouds. There are three windows
  total on the top floor and one on each side of the giant
  green door.  Christopher's window is just to the left above 
  the door.  Only way to see if Christopher Robin is home
  would be to enter the door.

  Two wing back chairs, an ottoman, a couch and coffee

{W}A Bedroom{w}~

  Though not very exciting to look at, this room is 
  certainly functional. There is a double bed dressed
  in white linens next to the door facing the window.
  A tall dresser stands next to the window where a 
  plush chair sits. The room has hardwood floors just
  like the rest of the house.

  Facing the back of the house, this room doesn't get
  the sunlight that the others get. Still, the soft
  eggshell walls and patchwork quilt make the room very
  warm. There are a few pictures of relatives hanging
  on the wall near a short dresser. A vanity with a 
  hairbrush, comb and mirror sits under a large lamp
  in the corner of the room.

  Somehow, like all little boys' rooms, Christopher's room
  is a magical place with toys and storybooks. Under the large
  window overlooking the front yard sits a toy box. On top of 
  the box are a stuffed bear, pig, rabbit, and donkey. The bed
  is neatly made with a dark wooden frame and blue patchwork
  quilt. On the floor near the dresser is an army of small 
  wooden soldiers ready to march and a book titled {bo,UND,G}When We{und} 
  {UND}Were Very Young{und,BO,BLU} is open on the area rug in the center of the

  remove shoes and leave wet coats without traipsing through
  the house. This mud room has a coat rack, a row of small shoes,
  a washer, dryer, cupboard, and a sink. The backyard is accessible
  through the door opposite the kitchen.

{W}The Powder Room{w}~
{W}
  White tiled walls with white ceramic fixtures
  are the theme of this bathroom. Even the faucet
  is a white ceramic! The area rug on the floor
  is white and the curtains on the window are
  white. The soap is white and so is the toothpaste.
  It's a very sterile environment.

{W}The Stairs{w}~
{W}
  The wooden rails that line the stairs are supported
  by white painted spindles. The steps are covered in 
  a floral runner so that one doesn't slip on the way
  up. There is a chandelier at the top of the case
  lighting the way. It's not very fancy, but very 
  functional.

  In the carefree days of any boy, a path in the

  summery afternoon, it is easy to forget where{G}

{Y}A Path in the Hundred Acre Woods{y}~

  In the carefree days of any boy, a path in the
  woods can become quite important. And just like{Y}
  any other boy, Christopher Robin knows this path
  quite well. Still, in the sun and warmth of a 
  summery afternoon, it is easy to forget where{G} 
  one is and just wander aimlessly for hours not

  Upon entering the Robin household, there are three directions

  clean and neat. There is a handsome chair complete with a tall
  back, mirror, hat and coat hooks to the left of the door.
