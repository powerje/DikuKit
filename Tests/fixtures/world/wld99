{BOLD}{BLUE}Northern Crossroads Elementary School{blue}{bold}~

From your seat in the big yellow school bus, you can see Northern
Crossroads Elementary School. This is you first day at elementary
school and butterflies are flying around you stomach because 
of the nervousness you feel. Your bus slowly approaches the drop
off zone, as you look through the window of the bus you see a 
big brick building towering very high. The bus comes to a stop
and it is time for you to get off and face your fears. Good luck
at your first day in elementary school.
