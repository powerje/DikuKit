  a huge ball of fire.  She unleashes the ball between you and your 
  partner, just barely missing.  You attempt to draw your weapons
  and cast your spells, but all aside from your mouth is frozen 
  instantly.  Scared beyond belief, you implore to this being that you
  and your partner are mere treasure hunters, searching the river 
  and village for any possible artifacts.  After explaining for
  endless hours about who you are and where your from, the flying

  left Aucan to explore the jungle, took a wrong turn and ended up fleeing

  in vain to hit it with your hand, but to no avail.  After a few
  moments the creature makes what seems to be a sigh of exhaustion.  
  You mutter to yourself, Ah.. Poor little guy is all tired, hehe...  
  The creature snaps its mini-fingers, and within a flash of a second 
  appears directly in front of your face.
