  {CY}You stand in a field of lovely {YEL}wildflowers {CY}as a calm, cool, refreshing breeze 
  blows gently past, and through you.  The sky above you is calm with white, 
  poofy clouds scatter across it.  Despite the serene appearance of where you're 
  at, you notice a strange lack of music and sound.  No birds are chirping, no 
  insects buzzing, nothing but the gentle breeze, your own heartbeat and the sound 
  of your armor as you walk.  In the distance you can see a vast, and lush looking 
  forest.{bo,WH}

  {BO,C}The field of lovely {bo,Y}wildflowers {BO,C}continues before you, but you notice that you 
  are approaching the edge of a large, lush forest.  Unlike before, when you were 
  further away, the forest seems a bit dark, and, foreboding.  Still, that doesn't 
  seem to bother you now as the lovely flowers tickle at your skin and the perfect 
  weather seems to lighten your mood.  In your mind, however, you get the eerie 
  feeling that not all is as it seems here.{bo,WH}

  {BO,C}You stand in a large field of lovely {bo,Y}wildflowers{BO,C}, all of which seem very 
  healthy, and large.  Some of the wildflowers almost seem alive,moving in 
  response to your movements and actions.  The scent from the flowers is 
  very sweet, while also being intoxicating. A soft, cool breeze blows 
  through your hair, making it dance lightly. The weather is nice and warm 
  with a nearly cloudless sky above you.  Off in the distance, to the north, 
  you see a large, lush forest.  To the west, east and north of you are more 
  wildflowers.{bo,WH}

  {BO,CY}You continue along a small path through the tall, lush green grass. As 
  you walk you admire the many {bo,Y}wildflowers {BO,C}that barely peek out from above 
  the tall green grass.  The songs of the sunflowers tingle your ears as 
  the breeze gently blows through your hair.  The lush green grass tickles 
  your arms and legs as it waves gently in the breeze.  The soft ground is 
  cool and provides ample padding for your aching feet.  The sky above has 
  few clouds and those that are present take odd shapes, which add to the 
  serenity of your surroundings.  You begin to ponder if all of this serenity 
  seems too good to be true.{bo,WH}

  {BO,CY}As you continue to walk through the field of {bo,YEL}wildflowers{BO,CY} you cannot help 
  but to gaze at a huge, towering tree that seems to block the entrance to 
  the forest up ahead.  You can see little else beyond except the tops of 
  the trees underneath it.  Both the enourmous oak, as well as all the
  other trees, seem to have black bark.  You find this unusual as all the
  oak trees you've seen prior to this have had brown bark.  As you ponder
  what this could mean, a cute sunflower holds out a small appendage as
  if to push you away from the giant oak.{bo,WH}

  {BO,C}You stand in and among all the {bo,Y}wildflowers {BO,CY}which all seem to dance and 
  frolick within the tall, lush green grass to the songs of the sunflower. 
  The sky is clear here, the grass and ground are soft while the breeze 
  that blows past you is cool and refreshing.  To north you see rows of 
  towering trees, but strangely, no avians of any sort can be seen in the
  sky.  Also, you cannot see any kind of animal life, let alone hear any
  kind of animal sounds.  All that there is are the pretty flowers around
  you.{bo,WH}

  {BO,C}The grass in the field here is shorter than elsewhere around you, 
  apparently due to the heavy traffic of wandering {bo,Y}wildflowers{BO,CY}.   The 
  field of tall grass and flowers extends in all directions, almost 
  as far as the eye can see.  As you get closer to the edge of the 
  forest to the north, something doesn't seem quite right. The forest 
  looks very dark and foreboding.  Still, right now everything seems 
  to be at peace.  Lovely music, sung by the Sunflowers, fill the air
  about you.{bo,WH}

  tall and filled with beautiful {bo,Y}wildflowers {BO,CY}that peek out cutely from
  the top of the grass.  The flowers sway back and forth to the lovely
  music that you've been hearing all across the fields.  White, poofy

  {BO,CY}The grass here is so tall it comes up to your waist, it is lush, green and
  healthy.  All around you are all kinds of {bo,Y}wildflowers {BO,CY}which dance and sway
  with the gentle, cool breeze blowing all around you.  The breeze turns the
  field of grass into an beautiful green ocean of calm and serenity.  A lovely
  song tingles at your ears, coming from the tall sunflowers around you.  The
  sky above is calm, the air is warm and the ground soft and supple.  To the
  far north you can a large forest with towering trees that look as if they

  and blows gently in the calm breeze.  Flowers sway in the breeze and a soft 
  melody from their songs tingle your ears and the soft ground underneath you 
  gently pads your feet.  A tall hill impedes your travel further west or 
  south, although you see you can travel northwards and eastwards through the 
  grassy plains.{bo,WH}

  reeks of decay and death.The only comfort you have is that the sky above

  trees.  One tree in particular, off to the northeast, seems much taller, and
  thicker than the rest, although it is hard to tell from your current vantage

  from the singing sunflowers almost puts you to sleep.  The field of flowers

  a bit closer, you can see that a darkness of some kind seems to be hanging
  in and about the forest, which might explain the lack of animal sounds in

  and dying.  Dead, and dying {bo,Y}wildflowers {BO,CY}lay on the ground while the ground
  itself is dry, cracked and seemingly devoid of nutrients.  A chilling

  {bo,Y}Finally, after travelling through the windswept plains of sentient wildflowers
  and staring at a dark and forboding forest, you arrive at a point where you
  think you can enter.  Of course, this is blocked too, but by a HUGE, towering
  black Oak tree that seems to move the closer you draw near.  It rumbles as it
  slowly moves and the leaves on its branches rustle in the chilling breeze. It

  is dark, frightening and anything but lush.  Large oak trees with black
  bark tower over you, creating a canopy that barely lets in any light, making
  the setting even more eerie.  When you were in the fields, all you could
  hear were the beautiful songs of the sunflowers.  Here, your ears are awash
  with a plethora of wildlife sounds.  Most of these sounds are hunting cries
  or cries of sorrow and desperation.  What is going on here and who, or what, 
  is behind it all?{bo,WH}

  {W,BO}You are standing in a room with exits leading in almost all
  possible directions.  All exits lead into an eerie, magical darkness
  from which the sounds of creatures stirring can be heard.  The
  room itself is carved from a fine, well crafted, marble substance.
  The walls, floor, and ceiling are all perfectly smooth and clear of
  any kind of debris or obstacales.  Something you find very uncommon...{w,bo}

An Obscure Opening~

As you step off of the pretty forest path you were on, you notice
the scenery begin to change. The temperature gets a little warmer
and life including plant and animal alike seems to be getting
sparse.

A Hot Trail~

You notice the terrain here becoming more and more desert
like. The air is much more dense and nearly unbearable. All
sounds have seemed to stop. All you hear are your own footsteps
and the clothes you are wearing brush against your sweaty body.
