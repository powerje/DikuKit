     for Gifted Youngsters, home base of Generation X. The Academy is owned 
     by Emma Frost, and is an affiliate of the Xavier Institute. The campus 
     includes dormitories, headmasters' cabins, and a biosphere, in addition 
     to classroom buildings, rec halls, and a state-of-the-art medical center. 
     When the Hellions were in residence, the Academy operated as a regular 
     private high school, with about a thousand normal students enrolled, 
     in addition to the Hellions. In its original capacity as Gen X's base 
     and school, enrollment is limited to the mutant kids.

     down from the podium, several Friends of Humanity members are 
     trying to climb up the stage to bring you down for killing 
     some of their guards. As you carefully scan the the podium, you 
     notice a strange looking switch and a key lock. Curious, you try 
     to flip the switch back and forth.

     You are standing on the east side of the podium. Facing the entire 
     headquarters, you take a good look across the room. As you look 
     down from the podium, several Friends of Humanity members are 
     trying to climb up the stage to bring you down for killing 
     some of their guards. As you carefully scan the the stage, you
     notice the podium to your left where the speaker was passing his 
     message of hate.

{WHITE}The office of Graydon Creed{white}~
  {WHITE}
     Here is the hidden office of Graydon Creed, president of the 
     Friends of Humanity. Cluttered all around the room are 
     propaganda materials, created by himself, that they use to spread 
     their hateful messages to the public. One note on his desk 
     catches your attention. It shows a listing of several known 
     mutants criminals but only two in particular are of importance,
     Victor Creed and Raven Darkholme.

     You are standing at the center of the stage. Facing the entire 
     headquarters, you take a good look across the entire room. As you 
     look down from the podium, several Friends of Humanity members are 
     trying to climb up the stage to take you down for killing 
     some of their guards. As you carefully scan the the podium, you
     find a hidden switch below the microphone. Would pushing the button
     alert more guards to come?

{RED}Age of Apocalypse{red}~
   {BOLD,BLUE}
     As you enter the Danger Room, the room's shape starts to reconfigure 
     itself. 
    {BOLD,WHITE}
     DANGER ROOM LEVEL SIX - THE AGE OF APOCALYPSE
  {bold}{RED}
     Once upon a time, Charles Xavier's son David wanted to make amends with his 
     father for all the hardships that he caused. With an amazing amount of power, 
     David went back into the past to the time when his father, Charles, met his 
     once best friend and worse enemy, Erik Lehnsherr, for the first time. David's 
     goal was to kill Eric before he had a chance to turn evil and become one of 
     the most feared mutant on the planet, Magneto. David's mission was almost 
     accomplished when a blast from his mutant power accidentally struck his 
     father instead of Erik Lehnsherr. Charles Xavier died and thus began, the 
     Age of Apocalypse.
