  The door to the south seems to have been ripped out of its hinges
  leaving just the doorframe.  The room slopes downward towards the

  This king must have been well loved. Great care was taken into the creation
of this altar. It stands only about 2 feet high with the remnants of candle-
wax on its top surface. It says in ancient tongue on its dusty top:
              "Praise the almighty Cristis the bringer of
                 good and justice to the world. He who 
                fought the evilest finally is at peace

the evil creatures that have invaded his domain and grave...He stands here
shimmeringly desolid and quite unable to effect the outside world or be
effect by the outside world...he is quite old, but very kind looking...
He holds up a tiny piece of parchment for all to read and look at with a
glimmer of tears in his eyes...
~
E
parchment~
  It says an aweful lot for its apperent size:
     "Hello stranger and last hope for Midgaard and this tomb!
   or just anyone who passes through my tomb.  This is a last plea
   for aid by a man long since dead from this Earth.  I have served
   all my life for the cause of good and hope for your help now 
   that my time has passed.  
     The forces of evil have taken control of this tomb and the great
   Kings of old need your aid to free us and deliver us to peace 
   once again. I think that I alone have been able to make myself
   appear and manage to have the last acolyte here write this note,
   for I am unable to speak, or affect this dying world.
     These forces of evil plan to eventually take over Midgaard
   and the outlying reaches for their own! They MUST be stopped. No one
   knows how long this will take it could be days it could be months!
     Their leader goes by the name of Roch'tar, the reincarnated Vampire
   of a time somewhere after my death.  He is yet not able to enter
   this world presently but is somewhere still trapped here in these
   tombs.  You MUST stop him by sytematically destroying his minions
   and followers who he has created from the dead and called from the 
   bowels of the earth!!!
     Thank you all who may endeaver to succeed and and may the Gods
   bless you on your Quest!"

 Two hints: in order to leave this place you must get the special 
    rod from a hidden vault in a room down and to the east somewhere...
    this room will be a painted room as well...look vault and it will
    tell you what to do...the second hint is that I may appear elsewhere
    in the lower sections of the tombs for more help!

  Nothing else mattered to him.  And like with wine, as time went on

  Paintings line the walls of the countless battles he took part in.

The shrine of Frath the Penniless~
More blood and gore are settled into this room.  The stench is
unbearable.  The walls are almost covered in blood and little chunks of
meat.  Almost as if it were painted on ... ICK!  In fact, there is a purpose
to it, it seems.  The original paintings on the wall are still visible.... but 
you have the urge to Vomit!! 
a distant moan is heard, though you cannot really place it.
The exit south is blocked by some rubble systematically piled there, and 
the door to the north is barred shut, thus the only way to go is either east
or west.

  Interesting...judging from the artwork Frath the Penniless was a very
generous ruler in his time...an excellent economist it seems...the joke at 
the time was that he gave out so much money that he was penniless himself!
He thus recieved that title by default.

The tomb of Frath the penniless~
  UGH! the scene is sickening...the sarcophagus is opened up and the mummified
body lies out in the open but ripped to pieces and partially gnawed pieces
of flesh and bone. Rubble lies to the north and the room has been physically
raised somehow because the only exit is downward from where you came...

The grand hall of the kings~
  You are at the very western end of the grand hall of the kings.  Again
someone seems to have purposely jammed the door leading south...there is a 
door leading north and the hallway continues west.
Tho the southern door is blocked and damaged you can still making out some
writing at its head.

The lower chambers and tombs of the undead~
  The stench of death is heavy in here...you think you may get easily lost
in these caverns...But then again this place is quite different!
  The room has been totally hollowed out and smoothed...and a pit has
been drilled in the center of the floor (though nothing is in it).
  Also extensive gruesome paintings of beasts and monsters terrorizing the
country side; vampires sucking the blood of beasts and humans alike...
the scenes are horribly graphic.
The Ghost of Cristis is floating here...

  He looks alittle fainter and is holding up another parchment for you
to read...
~
E
parchment~
  Written on it he says :
      "Congratuations adventurer you made it this far! Now, in order
    to get out of here look at the vault hidden in the painting and
    get the key pry rod that will take you out...if you have passed
    through all of these monsters and abonimations with ease you are
    ready to continue. But if not the rod will help you get out.The
    Vault will clue you on what to open.
      There exists nearby a horrid beast called Snapper Joe...he is
    a reincarnated fiend called up directly from hell...he is tough
    but if you manage to kill him he has a key to the lower depths 
    of these horrid tombs and catacombs. I cant promise you what lies
    ahead but it will promise to be challenging and hopefully will
    prove that we are nearing the end of the reign of the Horrid
    Roch'tar.
      If you need to rest and come back, take the rod. But remember to 
    dump it so that others will have a chance at continuing here also.
      Thank you again brave fellows!"
