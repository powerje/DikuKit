The Tower Balcony~

        You are standing on a balcony in the highest room of the mansion.
You are high enough to be able to see over the treetops, but you see
nothing but mossy trees and gray mist.  The thought of being stuck
in a place like this fills your heart with despair.  With a sigh, you
turn around, and you spot a mirror to one side of the door.  Looking
into the mirror, you do not see yourself, but you see. .

Zombie Creation Room~

        There are body parts piled in huge heaps in this room.  A lone
zombie is stitching pieces and appendages together.  A corpse lying
on a bed at the far end twitches, then sits up and stares around
dully.  This must be a room where new zombies are created.

In a Dark and Gloomy Cellar~

        You are in a dark and gloomy cellar.  Huge spiders weave thick
cobwebs in the ceiling.  Empty barrels are tossed all over the place.
There is one barrel sitting squarely in the center of the room. 
Against your better judgment, you look inside and see red wine.  You
are about to take a sip when a finger floats to the surface.  
This is no wine, this is blood!  With a gasp, you throw yourself away
from the mangled corpse floating in the barrel of blood.

Mistress of the Swamp~

        You gape around in this clearing with wonder.  Not only is the
land dry, its actually lush and green with healthy fruit trees
growing.  A green skinned nymph with gray hair walks toward you.
She stares at you with a solemn expression.  "You will need a special
key to enter Misroi's mansion, and I have the key.  But first, you
must prove to me that you are strong enough to battle his evil."

Lost in a Swampy Forest~

        Stepping from mound to mound gingerly, you try to make out which
looks solid and which is certain death.  As you stand still, trying to
make up your mind, the mound under your feet suddenly decay into 
muddy water, and you plunge screaming into the hungry swamp. . .

Lost in a Swampy Forest~

        As you walk along the muddy path, something flickers at the
corner of your eyes.  The rattling also seem to be louder.  You turn 
your head to look, but you see nothing.  You shrug and move on.  Again 
you see something moving at the very corner of your eyes and you whirl
around, but there is still nothing.  You begin to get the paranoid 
feeling of being watched by some shadowy figures.

Still Lost in a Swampy Forest~

        You walk gingerly along the path, sometimes hopping from mound to
mound in the bog.  The ground ripples faintly around you, and you realize
how fragile the ground is as you could plunge straight into the ground
and be trapped in the muddy water beneath...  you swallow hard.  You also
hear some faint rattling in the distance.

to sweat, although you do not feel hot or cold.  There is a total
lack of sound and sensation.  Even your own voice is strangely
muted as you call out so you can hear yourself.  Unsurprisingly,
there is absolutely no response.

mist.  You think you can see movement but you are not certain if

        Will this cursed mist never end?  Step after step, for
hours after hours, you plod on aimlessly.  You no longer even

nor are you certain that you are actually moving at all, or
simply remaining stationary and merely moving your legs in air.

you cannot be certain of anything.

Entrance to Hazlan~

     Finally you found a way out of that damned mist!  You feel
a rush of gratitude and you barely restrain yourself from falling
down to kiss the ground under your feet.  However, after glancing
upward at the sky, your new-found euphoria vanishes as the black
clouds roils threateningly overhead, with distant flashes of lightning
in the horizon.  The mossy path under you leads ahead to a dark and
gloomy tower of some sort.  Behind you is nothing but a thick gray
wall of mist that you just so recently escaped from.

Before the Tower of Hazlik~

     Before you stands a massive tower, the likes of which you have
never seen before in your life.  The tower is completely covered
in lichen and moss and ivy vines so that you can only just barely
make out the dull gray stone wall underneath the greenery.  An
ancient-looking wooden door looms before you, with hideous gargoyle
heads adorning the arch around the door.  The sky is dark and
threatening, and you can feel your confidence vanishing as you 
stare up at the tower.

Inside the Tower of Hazlik~

     As you stand inside the foyer, you stare around in awe.  The
tower is both magnificent and eerie.  Hideous gargoyle heads leer
down at you from dark crevasses in the rafters and you can hear
strange chanting sounds in the distance.  Dark robed figures pass
by you silently.  Some of them gaze at you with threatening glares.
The light is very dim in here, casting eerie shadows everywhere. . .

The Third Floor of Hazlik's Tower~

     As you lurk about on the third floor in the gloomy tower,
the robed figures seem less and less friendly about them.  Some
of them even appear hostile toward you.  "DEATH TO HAZLIK!" one
of them scream at you as they rush at you.  You are shocked at the
pure and absolute hatred in his voice.

The Roof of Hazlik's Tower~

     You've made your way up to the perilous roof of this dreadful
tower.  Cracked stone line the crumbling parapet.  Dark clouds loom
threateningly above in the sunless sky.  A howling wind threaten to
tear you off the roof over the broken parapet to your doom...
To the south, you can see a figure standing on some sort of a raised
pedestal, surrounded by mysterious figures.

Near the Windy Pedestal~

     Howling wind rushes past you while you step gingerly over the
broken stones lying on the roof.  You're uncomfortably aware of the
fact that you're walking on the edge of the roof where the parapet
had long ago decayed and fallen, leaving nothing behind to protect
you from a long fall should the wind push you off... ahead, you can
see the robed figure on the pedestal glaring down at the people
circling around him at the pedestal base.

On the Pedestal of Power~

  'Fraglizik' 'Death to Hazlik' 'Gnoblicius' 'Death to Hazlik', the 
mysterious robed figures surrounding the pedestal chants over and over
again.  Your neck hair rise at the power words being spoken.  On
the pedestal stands a small but weird-looking man.  He has strange
and arcane tattoos on his bald head, and he glares down at his foes
while uttering some devastating words of power.  Lightning crackles
in the sky with booming explosive thunder.  Oddly, you are deeply
afraid.... very afraid...

Around the Tower of Hazlik~

Pushing your way through the thick bush surrounding the tower,
you search for another way into the monolithic and immobile gray
tower.  The air seems deafening silent.  Even the dark and
threatening sky is quiet.  The hair on the back of your neck
rises.

Around the Tower of Hazlik~

You finally push your way into a small opening.  At the bottom
of the tower, nearly hidden by moss and overgrowth, you see
a rusty and corroded grate.  An unbelievably awful smell
reaches your nose, gagging you and you fight to hold down the
bile.  Maybe this isn't such a good idea after all...

Below the Tower of Hazlik~

OH NO!!!!!!  You scramble and flail your arms around, trying
to find a hand-hold, but to no avail.  You slide along helplessly
into the darkness below....

Swimming in Sewage~

Oh yuck!  You're swimming in raw sewage, and brown gunk clings
to your armor and skin.  You feel positively sick to your stomach
at the feces and urine dripping from you.  And the smell....!
Light shines in from the east through a grate.  You should be
able to climb your way out through there.  Suddenly you sense
something moving in this sewage....

The Mystical Laboratory~

This is a dark and gloomy laboratory that looks like it hasn't
been used much as cobweb and dust covers nearly everything.
However, in one corner, there is a strange looking machine with
electricity crackling between its electrodes, which seems to
form some sort of a portal...
