{Y}Poorly Lit Cobblestone Path{y}~

   A broken path of stones graces the way ahead.  Your feet ache
   and tremble as your footing becomes rough along this terribly
   built road.  Miles and miles of trudging through open land has
   cost your patience dearly.  Up ahead you see a faint glint of 
   light that glows in and out of existence.

   You seem to be on a short trail with scattered leaves
   and thistles covering the dust.  The twisting path ahead
   looks gloomy and dark. You can hear strange sounds in the
   distance, but cannot determine whether it is screaming,
   yelling, or crying.  Perhaps you can help them, whoever
   they are.

   Gates made of the finest Spanish steel protect the city's 
   inhabitants.  Many of the sights ahead look gloomy and threatening
   and you can tell that the last few years have not been good to 
   these people.  You can see beggars and thieves littering the streets
   and your intuition tells you that you should head back the way you 
   came for fear of losing your life to these ruffians.

   You are standing in a large place where there is nothing but
   candy and chocolate! You feel a sense of sheer ecstasy
   as you plunge into a fantasyland of sweets.  In the distance,
   you can see the Chocolate Waterfall and the Psychedelic Lollipops.
   You start to run, but then find that it has all come to life!
   You wanted to enjoy them, but instead, they want to enjoy you!

{Y}Churning {BO}{C}Waterfall{c}~

   You are caught in the waterfall's suction device.  The
   undertow is so great out here that one could easily get
   drawn into the intake pump.  As you make your way through
   this mess of debris and filth, you notice that there is
   a guard here which is in your way.  He looks pretty
   strong and powerful and you hesitate at the thought of
   fighting him.

   The Gold in those Golden Eggs must be worth a FORTUNE!!!
   You cannot help but give in to the temptation of getting
   one of your very own.  You stare at the Nest, longing for
   just a touch of that golden surface.  Just watch out for
   the Geese who may not be so happy about giving you one.

   Little bits of information travelling at the speed
   of light directly to your TV set.  That's what happens
   in the world of television.  Wonka has been working
   top secretly with the Oompaloompa to develop a highly
   technological machine capable of sending mass quantities
   of food through the air at LIGHTNING fast speeds.

   "Lights! Camera! Action!" are the words that you hear

   are trying to make a HUGE Wonka Bar go over the air waves to
   a TV in the other room.  It is a bit like the transporter room
   that you saw on a Star Trek episode, but the object comes out
   ten times smaller on the other side!

   Despair and Anguish plague this once library of recipes
