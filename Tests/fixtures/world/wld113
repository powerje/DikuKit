{BO}{R}### Before the Ancient Temple ###{r}{bo}~

  You stand before a huge ancient temple. You would easily
  believe that the building has stood here for hundreds of 
  years, and appears as though it can stand for 500 more.
  The condition is someone astonishing, being so old yet
  so beautiful.

{YEL}### Ancient Carved Gates ###{yel}~

  You stand here before the almost magically carved gates
  of this ancient temple. The doors themselves are as old
  as the temple, if not older. Depicted in the carvings are
  that of a Monk of times long forgotten, and his sole pupil.

{YEL} Passing Beneath The Temple Walls {yel}~

  These walls are much thicker than you might have believed
  when viewed from the outside. They are approximately 4 feet
  thick, and are made of solid granite. The walls could
  withstand an attack of any but the most brutal weapons of war.

{WH}Upper Level of the Ancient Temple{wh}~

  You have reached the upper level of the temple to find that these
  halls are rather busy. There are acolyte and monks rushing back and
  forth, it's actually something you wouldn't expect to witness from the
  "great" men.

{BO}{BLA}Narrow Passage{bla}{bo}~

  This passageway is very narrow, and you wonder what its use could
  possibly be. What ever is found at the end of this tunnel must have
  a value to the monks, because they sure don't want to see outsiders
  travelling down here.

{BLI}{BO}{YEL}Sacred Pagoda Resting Room{yel}{bo}{bli}~

  The pagoda, so foolish looking yet so revered by the monks. To
  destroy this Pagoda would cause cries of outrage to be heard throughout
  the temple. But, destroying the Pagoda would also show your dominion
  over these monks. What a dilema you are faced with.

  art of defence and the knowledge of life. The only men permitted beyond
  these gates are those who have chosen to follow the same path as the
  guards themselves. To the south is Poor Alley, and to the north is
  the outter training yard.

  Before you stands your Master in all his glory. He looks to be quite
  old, probably over one hundred years old. However he has the skills
  and abilities of a man half his age. To the east is the outter training
  yard.

Gates to the Brawler Guild~

  You stand in front of some very loosely guarded by some bums.
  As you approarch the gates, you become very aware that these aren't
  your ordinary bums.  They seem to be very rowdy and inhospitible.
  You best stay away if you're not one of their kind.

The Outter Training Area~

  You see more and more grapplers as you go further in the training grounds.
  You sense that you shouldn't try to take on any of these beasts by yourself.
  It's best to keep to yourself and go north to find your master.
