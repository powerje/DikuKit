Intersection Hallway~
This large hallway lead to four different directions. To
the west you can hear wood being hit by something, or is
it something being hit by wood?  To the east you hear metal
banging around.  And to the north you hear nothing because it
is a Restricted Area.

Staircase~
As you look up the staircase, you quiver as a foul stench

should proceed upwards, you notice that the room seems
somewhat odd.
