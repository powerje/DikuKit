{W,BO}Path to Pizza Hut{w,bo}~

   {R}Welcome{r}.  {BO}{B}You are on a well worn path leading up to the{b} {W}Entrance{w} 
   {BO}{B}to{b} {BO}{R}Pizza{r} {BO}{Y}Hut{y}. {BO}{B}Many have come this way before, and a lot of them 
   have managed to return with their sanity, after tasting the most
   delicious pizza ever. Though others have mysteriously disappeared 
   without a trace, and have never been seen again{b}!
       
   {BO}{BLU}Step lightly, and watch your back.. Things inside this restaurant 
   are not always what they seem, and hardly ever what you expect{blu}.

Parking Deck Platform~
These kids are blocking your progress.. they seem to think it is some kind
of game. Defending some lunatic kid standing on your precious Betsy. If they
don't climb out of your way pretty fast, you might need to resort to some violence.
These kids are really getting to be a pain.

King's Domain~
You have entered the King's Domain... and it seems he is not too glad to see
you. He doesn't even acknowledge all the noise you're making about the new
paint and wax job you just got for ol'  Betsy. This guy is getting on your last
nerve. Guess you are really going to have to teach him the lesson you had
planned. The way he carries himself shows that he can handle himself in a 
crisis..... can u???

Side Lounge~
You are standing in a well furnished lounge, and the you can
hear the music clearly. It soothes, and calms you. An innate
sense of peace, and harmony descends on you, and you feel
like grabbing a couch, and just lying there for a long time.
 Straining to maintain a sense of purpose, you can make out
some grinding sounds coming from somewhere to the west. And
to the north you can make out people's muted voices.

Slightly Hidden Room~
While in the lounge you noticed a well concealed entrance to the
east, and so you decided to explore it. The grinding sounds are
louder than before, and there is a door to the west with a sign
on it. The sign has KEEP OUT!! painted in a shaky handwriting.
The door looks well maintained, and it doesn't even seem to be
locked....
  You look about to make sure no one is watching.....

   {BO}{C}It appears that no one is around to actually enforce that rule. The

This is nowhere.~
  
  All around you trees are dead, and they have sap oozing
out of the deep fissures in their bark. Their leaves are
dried up, and though you would expect the leaves to fall
to the ground they are still hanging on the branches. Some
of the trees have fruits growing on their branches. But
from the number of dead bird-like creatures under the 
trees, you assume they are not exactly edible.
  From somewhere amongest this dead, suffering forest you
can hear the howls of hungry, blood thirsty beasts. All
around you Trollocs burst from the scanty cover of the 
trees and lunge at you. Better start running.
