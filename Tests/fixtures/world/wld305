Molecular's Temporary Laboratory~

     You find yourself inside some sort of strange molecular laboratory.
Chemicals shelve the walls, each bottle and flask with symbol-strewn labels
on them.  Perhaps it is best for your general health to not touch anything!
You can't help but to be drawn to the strange equipment and fascinating
contraptions that line the room and cover the benches.

A Little Deeper into the Lab...~

     You have perhaps ventured somewhat further than you may have wanted.
Be careful, because the things which surround you are completely unfamiliar
to you.  You can't help but be a little worried.

Inside the Hood~

     You are now within the Fume Hood.  Air is rushing by you and seems to
be heading toward some device above you.  Maybe it seemed like a good idea
at the time to crawl in here, but it doesn't now!  What is that plexiglass
shield-like thing resting on the metallic surface?? It has two of those little
yellow stickers with the funny symbols on them...
     As you peer up into the shaft cautiously, trying not to clang your armor 
against the surgical steel surface, you think you hear a slight screeching 
sound over the noise of the wind rushing by your ears.

By the center bench~


     Here is the beginning of the lab bench which appears to be central in
the room.  A giant pile of papers and volumes of protocols are on the very
end of the bench, ready to topple onto floor.  The bench is covered with papers and unsuccessful experiments.  You wonder if it is safe to be left like
this...Ah, what the hell - They know what they are doing, Right??

     Swarms of fruit flys suddenly come at you!  Someone must have opened or
dropped a vial of them for an experiment...

     You are now standing in a corner, near a lot of expensive looking 
equipment.  Everything seems to have a funny yellow sticker with a symbol
on it.  There is a PCR machine and incubator toward the east and some
very large, mean looking, metal contraption stretching from the floor to the 
ceiling to the south.  There is a steady flow of air being sucked on by
you INTO the device...what the hell IS that?

A wall lab bench~

     The bench on the east wall continues.  Above the bench are shelves upon
shelves of countless bottles of reagents and growth media, probably some
cobwebs too.  You see an abandoned lab notebook laying here with fresh pencil
marks on it...Where did this person go?  Probably trying to get away from the 
hoards of students roaming around looking for the professor to answer their 
questions about Mitosis.  They sure are blocking your way!

     The lab bench on the east wall ends at this point and there is a door to 
the north which leads to the assistant investigators office.  You roll your 
eyes in disgust as you think of the new AI, knows very little but talks a lot.  
Students crowd around you as they desperately try to ask questions about an 
upcoming exam...they sure do get in the way!

completely enclose an area of about 50 feet by 100 feet.  What in the hell

Perhaps you should follow the constant flow of air...
     A little creature of some sort is resting here, almost swimming against 
the breeze like a fish swims against a current...how curious.  Hope they 
aren't too vicious...

Up the Hood Vent~

     The fumes are getting a little better...but are still heavy.  The flow
of air has lessened somewhat, due to the slight widening of the squarish
ventilation shaft.  How can these creatures possibly live up here?  They 
apparently love the flow of air because they use it to their advantage when 
they attack you.

rustle and whip around to see what it was...
     The blower machinery creating this awful wind is to the left.  With a 
glancing look, it appears to be a gigantic fan which is rotating very quickly 
indeed.  Looks like your puny armor would be no match for those rotors.

On the Roof~

     As you squirm through the small hatch to exit the ventilation system, you 
bang on the cap in utter frustration, and the sound of defeat rings in your 
ears and throughout the entire ventilation system.  Finally, standing on the 
roof, you calm down some at try to squint out into the distance.  Many other 
buildings and the quiet city of Midgaard are easily visible in the contour of 
the landscape.  You peer in the opposite direction, through a slatted wall, 
and see what appears to be some sort of fenced-in area with feathers, fur and 
broken links of chain all around it.

Widening of the Crack to a Corner~

     You made it to the southeastern corner of the chamber.  The fissure
in the wall may serve as a marker for where you have been, and where you
will go in the near future.  The fissure is quite a symbolic entity.
As you marvel at this revelation, you are attacked on all sides!!!

     You see a wierd looking building up the street.  It stands out because it 
doesn't seem to have any windows.  Maybe if you get a little closer, you can 
figure out what is going on.  The stone work on the building looks rather 
interesting anyway, this deserves a closer look!

Stairs to a Strange Building~

     As you approach the building, you notice the magnificently crafted steps.
It is as if dwarves personally carved each step, handrest, and gargoyles 
sitting upon block columns.  You step up the steps very slowly, your equipment
swishing and clanking softly as you steadily approach the edifice...
column of glass is partitioned into stories consisting of layers of shelves

upon closer examination there are definately no windows.  The walls seem to be 
made of a grey stone with a curious texture.  The entrance is simple and the 
doors are wooden with no glass or any transparent material.  It is as if there 
is material inside which is sensitive to light...

Inside of a Magnificent Glow~

     You enter the large structure with a slight gasp of awe.  The walls are 
actually glowing, as if just slightly transparent to the exterior light, 
creating a soft greyish atmosphere.  The ceiling must be 50 feet up, and made 
of the same transparent stone that the walls are made of.  The longer you 
stand in the room, the more comfortable you feel.  A large, circular glass 
structure reaches from the grey marble floor nearly to the ceiling.  The 
column of glass is partitioned into stories consisting of layers of shelves 
filled with what look like books.

plaque~
     The stone used to make these walls is of a slightly translucent stone 
which has been found only in a mine in Argentina.  Use of this special stone 
was chosen due to it's ability to filter wavelengths of radiation which are 
dangerous to the ancient and valuable tomes present in this collection.

outside of the building.  Maybe from the balcony you can get a better look

A Small Balcony of Wrought Iron~

     The balcony is made of wrought iron twisted into beautiful shapes and 
designs, and is about 25 feet from the grey marble floor.  From this height, 
you can see that the central glass column does not extend to the ceiling, and 
there is another glass structure at the top, which is in the shape of a pear.  
Upon closer examination there also appears to be a silver-metallic substance 
inside of the glass.  The silver object really distributes existing light 
evenly throughout the room, it would in fact replace your existing equipment 
very well.  Unfortunately, there does not appear to be any easy way to get at 
it.

Before the Glass Enclosure~

     The entrance to the glass column requires a passcard, as is evident by 
the red flashing light above a keycard slot.  There are some serious looking 
librarians here making sure that their precious tomes are undisturbed.  They 
tell you of the magnificent translucent walls of stone all around you which 
protect their books from harmful radiation.

Inside of Knowledge~

     As you enter the great glass column, you can only think of the tremendous 
knowledge which fills the shelves of this athenaeum.  As you consider the first stack of leather bound volumes, librarians tap you on the shoulder. They are not too happy about the clanking of your armor in all of the excitemet.  These people are serious about their job!

     Librarians peer at you cautiously as your armor clanks when you walk by the 
leather bound maps and books from long ago.  It is obvious why all of the 
climate control is necessary when you stop to look at some of the volumes.  It 
looks as though they could fall apart at any time.  Wrought iron stairs twisted 
into shapes of ancient dragons and high gods wind up to the next level of the 
athenaem.

This must be the Biological Laboratory Building, housing all of the major research laboratories in the area.  To the east is the common autoclave room, where glassware and solutions are sterilized.  The exit to the north appears to be blocked by repair crews trying to fix a faulty steam pipe which feeds into the autoclaves.  Damn, the stairs up to the Molecular Biology lab is to the north!
