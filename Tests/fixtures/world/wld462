{BOLD}{BLACK}   You are now descending into what the locals call El Boca de Infierno{bold}
{BOLD}{BLACK}   that translates to the Mouth of Hell. Lava spreads out like small{bold}
{BOLD}{BLACK}   streams all around you, while small vents release a burning smoke{bold}
{BOLD}{BLACK}   from the inner core. Black glass-like rocks, known as obsidian, cover{bold}
{BOLD}{BLACK}   the ground and reflect the red glow from the lava. You have heard{bold}
{BOLD}{BLACK}   stories that the local natives feed this volcano human sacrifices.{bold}
{BOLD}{BLACK}   You hope you don't end up on the menu.{bold}
