On a cliff.~
Wow! You've never seen this cliff before. At least, you don't remember
one being here last time you checked. As you stand on the cliff the ground
appears unable to support your weight. If the ground crumbles, the fall
will be quite far. You might at least get a serious bump on your head.

FALLING!~
Well, looks like the ground gave way on you. Now you are falling
straight down......

The ground really seems to be coming up at you at a really fast
rate. You'll probably hit the ground in seconds....

You awaken.~
Here...
Comes....
The....
GROUND!! BOOM!!!!!
That's gotta hurt....
Suddenly you awaken in a strange bed.... The colors all around you are 
bright and cheerful.. It looks like you are in some girl's bedroom! You
freak out and quickly rise to your feet and look for the way out of here.
There is a door to the east of you. It could possibly be the way out.

In the hallway.~
You quickly rush out into the hallway in a panic. You really don't
have an idea of where you are at the moment. Maybe because you were
knocked out for awhile when you landed. You gotta find somebody and
ask them where you are. It's almost kind of freaky being here..

The Living Room.~

people smiling at you as you emerge from the stairway. You are
confused as to your wereabouts and wonder if you should kill
them. They seemed concerned for your well being, though. One of
them is baking a batch of cookies, the other is reading the paper.

Now you are walking around inside this arcade. All around you
you see people plunking in tokens to play their favorite games.
It looks especially crowded today. You might not even get through
to play the new Sailor V video game.

You have finally pushed your way through the crowd, and you
are now at the new Sailor V video game! A cute girl is sitting
at the controls, and she looks pretty frustrated. She then 
turns toward you, and decides to transform into Sailor Jupiter!
Looks like you distracted her and now she's mad!

Path to Starlight Tower.~
You are now heading northward to the famous Starlight
Tower. While walking toward the tower, you get a feeling
of some seriously bad vibes coming from that general
direction. Either you could investiagte, or you could just
turn around and go home.

you hear a girls voice calling out for a girl named Serena. You
really don't care who Serena is, so maybe this girl oughtta know
that you are not interested in finding her. She also seems to
be getting in your way.

but I'm sure whatever is in there will be worth the reward.

Standing in your way is what appears to be a shadow that has
risen out of the ground. He looks like he's rather mean, and 
he won't let you in. Could there be something up in the tower that
is very important?

Falling down the elevator shaft.~
Well you finally decided to head downwards, but now that
you were too far up, maybe you should reconsider your plan
of action. You start to fall..... very, very fast.... As 
you approach the ground at record speeds, you see some rather
large icicles come rushing out of the ground, looking to
impale you. If you can fly.... Maybe you'd be lucky...

Starlight Tower.~
Any other time, this place would be a romantic place to be. Looking
out from the top floor of this tower overlooking the city would
have been the perfect place for couples to be at night. Right now,
however, you sense danger all around you. The floor looks like
it's starting to crumble, and the organic organisms that cover
the walls look like they are about to come to life. You see
the stairway to the roof, but you also see a cat there. the cat
seems to be blocking your way onto the roof. Maybe she senses the
danger from the roof and doesn't want you to be a part of it.

You are now on the roof overlooking the city. You don't really 
pay attention to what is going on down there, because right in
front of you there seems to be some sort of portal leading to
another world! It's up to you whether or not it would be a good
idea to enter this portal to another land, because you really
don't know what you are getting into.

The Negaverse.~
You have been transported to a very dark and eerie world.
All around you there are hideous things appearing out
of nowhere. Scared, you try to shout for help, but nothing's
coming through. It's tough trying to communicate with the outside
world if you are in another dimension. There is a wierd smell of
sulfur in the air, and you see a few puddles lying on the floor.
These puddles seem to eat through your boots. Better tread carefully
around here, there have been tales of monsters that can seriously
damage equipment, so tread carefully! 

There is a sign in front of you, you better take time and read it!

Up ahead is the castle of the great Queen Beryl. There have been rumors
of great treasures being held in this castle. The Queen is a very dangerous
opponent, and getting to her will not be easy. Even the monsters in the
way of her will be tough to deal with. There are rumors of a famous
heroine behind held captive behind the castle, and there also are
rumors of hidden places around here. It would be wise to try to find
these places, and it would also be wise not to go alone, but in a rather
large group, since these mobiles here can really tear one apart limb by
limb.

Walking down this odd path you seem to notice a really
tall building to your north. A couple of powerful monsters
seem to be guarding the doorway to the palace. Along this way
you also see some very powerful looking mobs, If these types of
mobs are any indication of what you might go through, it's best to
turn back now!

You have reached the gates of this rather gigantic palace.
In front of the doorway are two giant shadow monsters, that
guard this palace. They kind of look like the one you
fought infront of the Starlight Tower. One was bad enough..
But two of them? Good luck.

The feeling of evil is obviously in the air. This place doesn't
seem normal at all. There is a hallway that leads northward.

any farther, you see something moving on the floor in the
one corner of this room. Could it be a way out?

more like an arena where the people from the Negaverse go and entertain
themselves. They seem to be applauding the soldiers Queen Beryl sent
out to find the intruders. Oh yea, I think Queen Beryl is referring
to you as those intuders.
