Pofessor Oak's Lab~
You walk into a room full of scientific equipment. Theres a small round
table located in the center of the room. On the table there are 3 balls
which are used to hold Pokemon. A scientist with greying hair notice's you
enter and keeps a close eye on you making sure you don't touch anything.

Pallet Town~
This is the western side commoner's seating area.  There are row upon
row of rough wooden benches bolted to the floor.  There is stadium garbage
everywhere and the smell makes you want to puke.  Stairs lead up to
Caesar's  private box, a small ramp leads down to the playing field and a
hallway  leads south.

seats benches~
The benches are made of rough cut lumber that has dried and split over
time. You would probably get splinters if sat on them.  The words 'BURT WAS
HERE' have been carved into one of the benches with exquisite care.

The Southern Commoner's Seating Area~
This is the southeastern part of the common seating areas.  The benches
here are made of stone and are probably centuries old.  A few scratches on
one of the benches catch your eye.  An acrid smell is coming from the east
and a tunnel leads off to the north.

The Abandoned Gate~
There is an iron gate blocking your way and judging by the amount of rust
and foliage growing on the bars, it hasn't been open for years.  Looking
through the gate at the barren landscape that lies beyond, you can see why.
A dirt road leads off to the  east, and a store is directly south.

Swords 'R Us~
Welcome to the weaponshop of Titus Andronicus!!  Rare halberds, whips,
swords and other instruments of death are proudly displayed on the walls
in gleaming glass cases.  More common weapons are stacked like wood on the
floor.  To the north you can barely make out a gate.  There is a very
secure looking door to the south.

The Back Room~
If you thought that there were a lot of weapons in the front of the store,
you haven't seen anything yet!!  There is barely enough room to walk
amongst the crates of armor and swords.  No wonder Rome will stand for a
thousand years.  The only exit is through a door to the north.

Penut Heaven~
You are now so high up that you begin to feel lightheaded and your nose
feels like it is going to start bleeding.  There aren't even benches to
sit on here; just bare dirty stone.  The view of the surrounding country
is spectacular.  Unfortunately you can barely see the playing field.
There is a set of steps here, leading down.

is the massive aqueduct and further in that direction lies the Mountain of
the Gods.

The Practice & Warm Up Area~
There are many gladiators, chariot drivers and their coaches here, warming
up in preparation for the games.  The dust rising from the parched earth
makes you want to sneeze.  A short tunnel leads east and the thunder of
pounding hooves and the clash of weapons can be heard coming from the
south.

chariot~
You see a two wheeled open cart which is obviously meant to be pulled by
horses.  The flaming paint-job and the large '01' stenciled on the side
identify the chariot as belonging to Drucilis 'Lightning-whip' Octavious, a
favorite driver of the masses.

The driver is too busy changing a wheel on his chariot to notice you.

CRASH!!!!... judging from the blood and the amount of distance that now
separates the gladiators head from the rest of his body, you can safely

The First Aid Station~
This is the place to come to if one is overcome by the heat and gore.
(Or if a lion gets loose)  You see a jar of live leeches and other barbaric
medical apparati lying about here.  From the west comes the roar of the
crowd, and a hall leads east.  The healer will be with you shortly.

This is a hard dirt track about a quarter of a mile long.  There are

had better move before you get run over.  A small tunnel leads west, you
can see the crowd to the east.  You can hear loud snarls and roars coming
from below.
