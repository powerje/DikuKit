{RED,BOLD} to head north. You are near drowning and better get

{RED} You got lucky.. You are still in one piece and
{RED} have not yet died. As you awake, you find that
{RED} you are captive to a strange creature that is
{RED} toying with you. He seems to believe that you
{RED} are dead, and will soon turn you into his puppet.
{RED} You glance around the room and notice that you
{RED} are still in the cave, which is good. You skillfully

{RED} your hands.{red}
