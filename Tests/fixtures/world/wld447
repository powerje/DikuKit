{W}Ash's Bedroom{w}~
  
  {W}You emerge from the computer terminal and realize you
  are in a quaint little bedroom.  The walls are covered 
  with Pokemon posters and charts.  Trophies and awards 
  cover the shelves.
                                    {Y,BO} :   -  {M}|---|{BLU} /\ 
                                    {Y}||| ){R}0{Y}( {M}|{W}0  {M}|{BLU} \/ {C}

{W}The Ketchum House{w}~
  
  {C}It looks as if the stove was just on in the 
  kitchen, but there is no one currently cooking.
  I wonder if Mrs. Ketchum is out shopping or
  on vacation?  Someone left the TV on, and its
  showing a program about {Y}Pokemon{C}.{c}

{W}The Porch{w}~
  
  {G}The porch looks out over quaint little {W}Pallet 
  Town{G}.  Over to the left, Mrs. Ketchum's garden 
  is overflowing with flowers and fruit.  There 
  is something moving in the bushes nearby - do 
  you think {M,BO}Mr. Mime {bo,G}might be hiding in there?

{W}Pallet Town - The Docks{w}~
  
  {Y,BO}These docks are very old - you can hear them 
  creaking with the tide.  You hear a ship in the 
  distance and see someone parachuting onto the deck.
  Looks like the parachute has a big letter '{R}R{Y}' on it!
  
  To the south, the jetty juts out into the sea.  There
  is a sturdy gate preventing you from accessing the
  boats that are docked there.{bo,y}
