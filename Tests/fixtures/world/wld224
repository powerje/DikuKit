Pit of Ghouls~

    {Y}Fleeing for your life you flee and fall down into what seems to be a 
    huge pit filled with debris, mostly bones. At least your safe from the 
    ghastly ghouls is your first thought, then you see the ghouls buddies 
    emerge from the shadows of the pit. Maybe you'll have more of a chance 
    if you climb out of the pit and face the ghouls upstairs. Then you see 
    the ghouls sliding down the sides of the pit blocking your way. Guess 
    What? Now you're in deeper{y}........{BO}{B}SH{G}*{B}T{b}!!

    and very dirty, but for some{y} {BOL}{B}odd reason the torches along the wall
    are still smoldering. Someone must have been here recently.{b} {Y}Wonder

Passageway Ends~

    {Y}This gloomy passageway finally comes to an end. Five unshaven
    warriors who appear to be guards rise to approach you. Out of
    the corner of your eye, you observe one of the men fixing the
    rug, which was oddly out of place. These warriors appear to be
    the ones the old mystic was talking about. This must be their
    hideout and these warriors are apparently on your side against
    the sultan!{y}

    {BO}{BLU}You enter this room via the hidden door beneath the rug and realize
    you've found the hidden chamber of the Askarian leader, Ahmad Husan.
    The noble looking warrior appears to be reading a piece of paper of
    some sort when you enter. When he sees you he smudgily smirks. You 
    can tell he is a man of action not of words as he draws his scimitar
    from its sheathe. "How about a test of steel to see if you are a true
    warrior?" are his words as he flashes his gleaming blade in twirling
    motions faster than your eyes can follow. Be ready to prove yourself
    if you want the Askar warriors on your side.{blu}

    {Y}You enter the high, windswept plateau, dotted by oasis and deep wadis
    due to the seasonal rain.  Sandstorms, quicksand, desert-thieves, and

    twirling desert storms impair your vision.  You squint and still barely
    see a gargantuan city in the distance.  You don't know whether or not
    to believe your eyes as it may be just one of the many mirages you've
    come across during your adventures throughout the lands.{y}

    {BOL}{B}Laying on the ground you notice various types of bones of humans
    and animals alike.  Under a mound of sand, a dusty old sign with

Road to the Palace~

    {Y}You notice that this road is rarely used since not many are allowed 
    to go to the palace, or should I say not many who go to the palace 
    ever make it back out. The road gradually becomes more and more dusty 
    and unused as it snakes it's way towards the palace walls. In the 
    distance you can finally make out the gates of the palace, they look 
    extremely enormous from where you stand. You peer towards the gates, 
    as it looks as though to be unguarded.{y}

    {BO}{Y}You have reached the {W}Majestic{w} {G}Gates{g} {W}of the {C}Palace{c}, {BO}{Y}which soars at 
    least fifty feet above you{y}. On the walls of the gates, etched in 
    {R}colored mosaics{r} are some of the {BO}{C}Sultans{c} most feared creatures. 
    There are several depicted here on the gates which are, {BO}{BLU}the mighty 
    winged serpent{blu}, {Y}desert giants wielding swords{y}, and {C}the noble djinni 
    riding a magnificent elephant{c}. This is the checkpoint for the palace 
    guards, though seem to be nowhere in site at the moment. You decide 
    to enter the gates, as you do {Y}swirling sands{y} kick up from the ground 
    and blind you momentarily. When you regain your vision you notice 
    that many of the {BO}{B}creatures{b} on the gate have somehow come to life. 
    {G}Unhappy with your presence they start to march towards you with 
    drawn swords{g}. {R}Prepare for battle, this might get a bit messy{r}!

Landing~

    {BO}{R}This room is a landing platform and there is a spiral staircase
    leading down into the depths of the dungeon. All around you the
    walls are charred black. There is nothing of interest to you
    except for some scrawled writing up on the wall. The writing
    seems to be tainted by rusty red streaks. Then you realize that

    you get an eerie feeling and the walls and floors cold touch doesn't 
    help any. Obviously this part of the palace isn't well kept{c}. {G}The walls 
    have many scratch marks and you wonder what type of beast or beasts

    look like they haven't been fed in a long time.  In your mind you 
    hope you don't ever have to run into one of these hungry critters 
    when you hear a noise like a baying of a pack or a mob as you see 
    a gruesome creature oozing its way down the hall. The most amazing 
    thing is that this creature appears to be made entirely out of 
    mouths and eyes. As the ooze fires it's spittle at you and ignites 
    the wall you panic and attempt to find the nearest exit {R}QUICK{r}!

Pit of Ghouls~

    {Y}Fleeing for your life you flee and fall down into what seems to be a 
    huge pit filled with debris, mostly bones. At least your safe from the 
    ghastly ghouls is your first thought, then you see the ghouls buddies 
    emerge from the shadows of the pit. Maybe you'll have more of a chance 
    if you climb out of the pit and face the ghouls upstairs. Then you see 
    the ghouls sliding down the sides of the pit blocking your way. Guess 
    What? Now you're in deeper{y}........{BO}{B}SH{G}*{B}T{b}!!

Pit of Ghouls~

    {BOL}{B}You try to run from the huge mass of ghouls piling up in the pit.
    They aren't very fast movers but there are so many of them and
    there's no obvious way out of here. Trying to run while making
    sure not to trip on bones is one thing, dodging the ghouls
    flinging themselves at you off the walls is another.{b}

Pit of Ghouls~

    {BO}{W}The mass of ghouls clawing at you seems to be endless.  You beat 
    off ghoul after ghoul {B}but to no avail as the onslaught continues. 
    Then as you're about to give up hope, you see a {W}glimmer of light 
    on the north wall. You rush towards the faint light and pray its 
    sanctuary. {B}The light is emitting from a sparkling gem in the grasp 
    of a dead skeleton. Up above you {W}the light reveals an exit. It leads 
    back up to the dungeon floor. {B}Anything's better than being here{b}!!

Cell~

    {BO}{B}You wonder what type of beast can actually survive in this stench 
    and darkness. Curiosity draws you into the cell. {C}Unlike like the 
    other cells you have wandered into, this one seems a bit different 
    then the others, in the corner is a creature of likes you have never 
    laid eyes on before. You approach the creature, as it appears to be 
    harmless in nature. {B}It looks as though it's been trained to do what 
    its master tells him to do. Observing the creature more closely you 
    see something shining around the creatures neck{b}.

Cell~

    {BO}{C}As soon as you enter the room, you realize its not just another cell.
    There are no monsters in here, though observing the ground tells you 
    that something has been here. You notice many torture devices hanging 
    upon the fresh bloodstained walls of this particular cell. The thought 
    of someone using them on another living creature, horrifies you. Looking 
    around the cell you notice the back wall is made entirely of stone and 
    brick, and is curiously different from the other walls{c}.

Chamber of The Magi~

    {C}After walking through the moveable brick wall you enter a huge room.
    Wow!! Is the first thing that enters your mind as you spot the piles
    of gold, and jewels lying upon the floor. The entire room is lavishly
    furnished, as it seems fit for a King! At the end of the chamber is a
    huge bed, and resting upon it is the hugest, ugliest, ogre you have
    ever seen...just snoring away{c}..{BO}{Y}ZZZzzz{y}...

    {BO}{B}Luckily he hasn't been waken by your entrance. At his waist you see a key
    in the shape of a skeleton. As you sneak over to get a closer look you hear
    the faint sounds of growling beneath a pile of gold. Sheepishly you turn
    around and notice that you were wrong! Out from the pile of gold a golden
    two-headed lion appears, stealthily making its path towards you. This huge
    beast of nature seems fixed on keeping you away from his Master{b}.

    {BO}{B}Only thing left to do is{b}...{BO}{C}NOT DIE{c}!!!
