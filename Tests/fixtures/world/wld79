The top of the fountain~
You are at the top of an enormous fountain.  Four magnificently carved
gargoyles sit at the top of this large fountain.  Water spews forth from
their mouths and makes a pleasant splashing sound as it hits the water
below.  The sound is so soothing that it almost puts you to sleep.  But
your sixth sense tells you that it would not be a good idea to go to
sleep here.
You move closer to the gargoyles to examine their craftsmanship.  It
is incredible, the carver of these statues must have to have been a
genius at his craft.  You go to touch the statues to see what they are
made of, is it granite, marble, obsidian?  As you touch the statue, they 
begin to move and turn their heads towards you, eyes staring deep into
your soul, as if reading you mind and thoughts.
