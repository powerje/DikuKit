 You are the beginning of rainbows, the color of love.
   Small and full of promise, I could hold you...
             However you choose not. 
{bo,Y}
 I dream the light of your soul, the color of sunsets.
 Vivid and full of relaxation, you could possess me...
             However I choose not. 
{Y,BO}
  You are the essence of wishes, the color of hope.
Bright and full of dancing energy, I could embrace you...
             However you choose not. 
{bo,G}
    I am the beginning of desire, the color of envy.
    Small and full of passion, you could crave me...
             However I choose not. 
{BLU,BO}
 You are the spirit of dreams, the color of firmament.
 Evasive and full of mystery, I could replenish you...
             However you choose not. 
{M,BO}
 I am the servant of honor, the color of nobility.
 Loyal and full of probity, you could enchant me...
             However I choose not. 
{bo,C}
We are the sounds of silent veracity, the colors of light.

 {C}
  A great carved mahogany desk sits in the 
  center of the room. Papers are scattered
  all across its engraved desktop. A case
  in the corner of the room houses a small
  collection of cuendillar, ter'angreal,
  sa'angreal, and angreal. An oil painting
  of the Dragon Reborn hangs over the desk.

{W,BO}The Tower Kitchen{w,bo}~
  {W,BO}
  You are standing in the Tower Kitchen. 
  Young and old women alike scurry around
  you clad in novice white. The head cook
  walks among all of the pots and kettles
  wielding a heavy wooden spoon like she
  would an oak cudgel. The stew really
  smells good.

  {G}
  You're standing on the lush green lawn in front of
  Arianne's house. The two story white house sits in 
  the center of a peaceful neighborhood. However, it
  seems to be anything but peaceful tonight! Pulsing
  rock music from within shakes the windows. Smiling,
  you head in to see what's going on!

The Things I Want~
To feel your hair.
Only it wouldn't be as simple as that, no.
It would not be so much the feeling of the hair
that would remind me of you as it would that
it remains that it's me, right here, right now,
holding your hair in my calloused and rough hands.
{NO}{no}
To see you smile.
Lips curl on a shaky highway, making your stomach
do topsy-turvy twirls every time you run across one 
of those types of curves. You know the type. 
These curves remind you of home, somewhere.
{NO}{no}
To dream with you.
Because in the waking world we only have each other,
but if we were asleep we'd be together in ways 
humanity can't possibly imagine. Life would be too great
for them to handle, and people would be clenching their fists in 
agony that they couldn't sleep, to dream. 
And you and I would wake, smile at each other (the topsy turvy curves)
and I would touch your hair with my rough and calloused hands (right here right now)
And we would dream the dream again.

 {C,BO}
  A shimmering mist fills the room. Yet, it is
  not damp. A cool, calming feeling comes over
  you as you meditate on life. The mist pulses
  and glows in time to your heartbeat.  As you 
  relax and let go it fades to a pale blue. In
  the mist time and space cease to exist. Only
  drifting thoughts form this reality.

{G}Dagobah Maze{g}~
         {G}I met him in a swamp down in Dagobah
Where it bubbles all the time like a giant carbonated soda
                    S-O-D-A, soda
      I saw the little runt sitting there on a log
I asked him his name, and in a raspy voice he said, "Yoda"
                    Y-O-D-A, Yoda
                   Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda
     Well, I've been around, but I ain't never seen
A guy who looks like a muppet, but he's wrinkled and green
                    Oh, my Yoda
                  Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda
       Well, I'm not dumb, but I can't understand
  How he can lift me in the air just by raising his hand
                    Oh, my Yoda
                  Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda
           Well, I left home just a week before
          And I've never ever been a Jedi before
       But Obi Wan, he set me straight, of course
    He said, "Go to Yoda and he'll show you the Force!"
    Well I'm not the kind that would argue with Ben
    So it looks like I'm gonna start all over again

{G}A Swamp in Dagobah{g}~
         {G}I met him in a swamp down in Dagobah
Where it bubbles all the time like a giant carbonated soda
                    S-O-D-A, soda
      I saw the little runt sitting there on a log
I asked him his name, and in a raspy voice he said, "Yoda"
                    Y-O-D-A, Yoda
                   Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda
     Well, I've been around, but I ain't never seen
A guy who looks like a muppet, but he's wrinkled and green
                    Oh, my Yoda
                  Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda
       Well, I'm not dumb, but I can't understand
  How he can lift me in the air just by raising his hand
                    Oh, my Yoda
                  Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda
           Well, I left home just a week before
          And I've never ever been a Jedi before
       But Obi Wan, he set me straight, of course
    He said, "Go to Yoda and he'll show you the Force!"
    Well I'm not the kind that would argue with Ben
    So it looks like I'm gonna start all over again

I asked him his name, and in a raspy voice he said, "Yoda"
                    Y-O-D-A, Yoda
                   Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda
     Well, I've been around, but I ain't never seen
A guy who looks like a muppet, but he's wrinkled and green
                    Oh, my Yoda
                  Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda
       Well, I'm not dumb, but I can't understand
  How he can lift me in the air just by raising his hand
                    Oh, my Yoda
                  Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda
           Well, I left home just a week before
          And I've never ever been a Jedi before
       But Obi Wan, he set me straight, of course
    He said, "Go to Yoda and he'll show you the Force!"
    Well I'm not the kind that would argue with Ben
    So it looks like I'm gonna start all over again

{G}A Swamp in Dagobah{g}~
         {G}I met him in a swamp down in Dagobah
Where it bubbles all the time like a giant carbonated soda
                    S-O-D-A, soda
      I saw the little runt sitting there on a log
I asked him his name, and in a raspy voice he said, "Yoda"
                    Y-O-D-A, Yoda
