Garbage Hold~
You are standing in neck high refuse.  Trash and garbage float by your head on
a liquid that you'd rather not know the nature of.  As you struggle to wade
through the muck, you feel something brush by your leg.  Could something be

Amidst the filth and horrid surroundings, people here attempt to build some
semblance of a life.  However, these the people in these levels live in a
place of shattered dreams.  This is a place where too many of the hopeful,
waiting patiently in near purgatory, fall between the cracks and end up
suffocating in humanity's own cruelty and apathy.  A lucky few among the hordes
may work their way up to the more affluent levels, but most just are born and

Main Street~
You have reached the east end of Main Street.  TO the north you see a massive
research institute:  Naruni Enterprises.

To the south - AAHHH!!!!  The building is on fire!  Why isn't anyone doing
anything about it?!

Magic Mansion~
You step into the mansion with trepidation about the wash of magic energy
pounding over you.  This dwelling is lavishly furnished and you wonder if you
should proceed beyond this entry chamber.

ESPECIALLY when you see the big sign that says, "NO trespassing upon penalty
of DEATH!"

Inferno~
You bravely forge you way through the flames that envelops the room.  Your
eyebrows are singed off, and your equipment charred black - gonna need to
shine it all later.  As you stagger reeling from the smoke and the buffeting
of the blazes, you wonder if it might not be prudent to turn back.

anyone who might be trapped in the flames.  Odd, you notice the house is on
fire, but it isn't actually burning down.

Techno-Wizard's Study~
You eagerly fly away from the Death Trap, tumbling into this room.  It looks
like a workshop of sorts - except that magic seems to be used even more than
technology.  For every wrench, there are two wands or engraving tools.

There is a techno-wizard here, glaring at you, and he looks PISSED.  You also
let out a groan when you see that he has summoned EDDIES to be lab assistants.
You HATE those things . . .

Inferno~
Man, this has GOT to be one of the stupidest stunts you've ever pulled.
Rivulets of sweat are pouring down your back, and you're not sure how much
longer your armor will protect you from the flames.  But being the courageous
(stupid) adventurer you are, you're not going to turn back unless Hell itself
freezes over.  (Is that ice you see?)

OH NO!!!  As you struggle your way into this room, you notice a human figure
encased in sheets of flame!  You're thinking of leaving because you don't
want the same fate as THAT fellow, and besides it's a dead end.  As you turn,
you wonder how that charred corpse is standing.  OH SPIT!  The sucker just
MOVED!

Body-Chop-Shop~
This is a filthy, unsanitary illegal clinic where a cyber-doc will (for the
right price) install any available cybernetics into your body.  This unscrupulous
careless surgeon will also PURCHASE cybernetic parts no questions asked, even
cybernetics with blood or flesh still dripping from it.  This is truly a clinic
only for the utterly desparate.
