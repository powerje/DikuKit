{BOLD}{RED}Entering the mall{bold}{red}~

{GREEN}  As you step into the mall, you see kids running everywhere.
{GREEN}  You faintly make out what they are screaming about. Find
{GREEN}  the beanie babies! They have escaped. You wonder what
{GREEN}  could have happened. Then you hear a woman scream PEACE
{GREEN}  HAS A BOMB SET! Maybe you should follow some kids and
{GREEN}  find this bomb.{green}

{GREEN,BOLD}  the lost b{BLUE,BOLD}e{CYAN,BOLD}a{MAGENTA,BOLD}n{RED,BOLD}i{YELLOW,BOLD}e{GREEN,BOLD}s. You see kids running around crying.
{GREEN,BOLD}  You know the stuffed animals are here somewhere but,

{GREEN,BOLD}  tell is that there are three hallways leading to a few
