Nnicol's Great Library~
{BOLD,BLUE}You stand in a large room with books stretching as far as the eye can see.  As you stop to examin the books they are on every subject known to man.  Some books in black binding contain the names of all the dead and freed souls.{bold,blue} {RED,BOLD} The warm fire burns with hellfire, although you feel uneasy it is strangly comfortable here.{red,bold}

A Dark Forest~
  
You are standing in a dreary and forboding forest or at 
least it was a forest at one time. You look around and 
you notice that all the trees are twisted and gnarled.  
Your body shivers being near them. You know there is a 
full moon, but you can't see the light through the trees.
You notice a small sign here.

A Muck Filled Moat~

The water here is dark and murky. The smell coming off 
the water is horrible. It is cold to the touch and you 
detect something moving in the water. Maybe it is 
just your imagination - or at least you hope so.

The Wide Bridge~

Interesting...a large bridge is here and unlike the rest
of the area, it is well maintained. The bridge is constructed
of smooth, black stones.  You have to be careful not to 
fall off. To the north you can see a large structure 
with gothic style architecture.

The Cloak Closet.~

You are standing in a old musty closet.  It contains a 
variety of old cloaks and capes.  As you look around 
you notice one of the cloaks is moving.  Worse yet, it
seems to be smiling at you.  You quickly brandish your 
weapon to dodge its attack.
