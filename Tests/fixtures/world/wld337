     {GRE}You appear to be somewhere within a {CYAN,BLINK}PROTOSS
     {WHITE,blink}Spaceship.  {GRE}You cannot seem to figure out where
     You are or how you got here...much less what
     This {MAG}Zealot{mag} is about to do to you....

     {MAG}You are walking down a huge hallway and stare in awe
     At the intricate designs on the walls.  They appear to be...
     Could it be...moving while you look at them?  How can this 
     Be happening???  You notice that there are gateways leading 
     In all directions.  However, when you look down you {CYAN}don't
     Seem to be able to find any {BOLD,BLINK}BOTTOM {bold,blink,MAG}around.

   {BLUE}You enter into what appears like a city, bustling
   with people going about their business.  You notice
   that this city appears to be particularly advanced 
   as a hovercraft whizzes right past your head.  Everything
   seems to be mobile, even the buildings.  Be careful,
   or a building might just drop on top of you.{blue}

     {MAG}You approach this huge floating {CYA}Spire{MAG} here in front
     Of you and wonder what this massive thing could ever produce.
     What kind of a race would ever create such a thing as disgusting
     As that?  Is this {CYA}Spire{MAG} actually moving after all?  Or could
     It be just your imagination?  What's that coming from the top?
     Oh no!!!! It's a {GRE}MUTALISK{MAG}!!!!

     The mutalisks flying after you, you begin to notice these
     Small little creatures floating along the top of the Spire. 
     At first you ignore them as cute little things, but as you
     Near the Spire they seem to approach you menacingly as if they
     Were protecting it from some evil beast...

{YELLOW}Artanis's Dorm Room{yellow}~
     {BLUE}You see a cluttered dorm room, with homework papers
that should have been done weeks ago littered about the room.
A TV in the corner with several borrowed chairs fills up nearly
all the walking space, and the computer in the corner looks like
it hasn't been used for work....ever....  The black lights and lava
lamp complete the soft mood room while the bed awaits company.
