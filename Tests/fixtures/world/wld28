Entrance to the Jungle of Kong~


  You stand in awe as your senses tingle at all of 
  the sights, aromas, and feelings of the jungle. It
  is rumored that King Kong himself reigns supreme
  here, and that he resides in a giant Wicker Palace
  on the other side of this massive jungle. You feel
  that you should proceed with caution, this jungle is
  known to be slightly overpopulated with all kinds of
  nasty creatures. Before you is the base of a very old
  tree.

Base of a Red Tree~


  The tree here is near the shore of the
  River of Kong. It appears to have blood 
  running down the bark of the tree. It 
  doesn't look like you can climb it from 
  here..... you could possibly climb another 
  tree and cross over. Judging from all of 
  the blood you see, it is probably best to 
  stay away from this particular tree.

It is what used to be a very large teddy bear. Its limbs have been torn off

A nice little room~


  Must be getting closer to Kong. The 
  surroundings here are much nicer than what
  you just came out of. Everything here is 
  clean and golden, worthy of a great king's 
  presence. There is a sign on the wall here 
  that states:

A Long Room~


  The room you are in now has many paintings
  of Kong on the wall. All of them attest to 
  his glory and powerful strength. Most of 
  the paintings are of Kong standing over the 
  corpses of the many adventurers he has killed
  in the past. Upon closer examination, the 
  paintings look much better. The room continues
  to the west.

  Kong paid for all of them. You see the 
  Palace Guard Room to the south and Kong's

bare hands. Another is a snapshot of Gob stealing gold from Mallin's front
pocket. What a slick guy!!!
