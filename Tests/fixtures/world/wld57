{BO,BLA}Mountains above {CY}Geatland{cy}~
{BO,BLA}The mountains are cold, and the wind is biting.  The air at
this elevation is thin and it seems impossible to get in enough
oxygen with each breath.  These mountains lead to the land of the
{CY}Geats{BLA}.  The people of this land are as rough as the mountains
that surround it.  A path that leads down to the forest can be made
out among the jagged rocks.

{BO,BLA}Mountains above {CY}Geatland{cy}~
{BO,BLA}The cold mountains begin to level off and come to the edge of
a forest.  Ahead the trees loom large and it seems the life eminating
from within can be smelled strongly, in contrast to the blight of the
mountains.  Already trees are can be seen spread out sparsly in the
area.  Also the hard rock as turned into hard packed soil, that although
cold, can support vegetation.  The path that wound down the mountains
continues on into the forest.

{GR}Forest of {BO,CY}Geatland{cy}~
{GR}The forest is full of sounds, and the smell of life is in the air.
The sunlight cannot penatrate through the canopy of trees, which extends
high above.  The forest is still in its natural state it seems, with
no sight of axes or magik used to fall the trees.  There is only a
ray of light from the entrance of the forest.  Beyond that the slope
of a mountain can be seen.  Here the path splits off in different 
directions.  Neither path has been used much by the looks of them.
Perhaps the forest is used as the {BO,CY}Geats{bo,GR} hunting grounds.

penetrates from what seems to be a rocky beach.  The vegetation is not
extreemly thick here, and the sounds from the forest are vague, yet
able to be heard faintly.  The sound of the {BO,BLU}ocean{bo,GR} can be heard to
the south.  No sounds or smell of people are about.  It seems unlikely
that there is a village very near to the area.

There seem to be no sharp rocks, but only a smooth sea floor below
which gives the feeling that perhaps a boat left ths very area not
long before.  To the south there can be seen something floating in
the Ocean.  There is also a smell in the air that is faint, yet it
sticks out from the smell of the salt from the ocean.  From the look
of the sea floor, and the body floating southbound, it seems whoever
left did so in a southerly manner.

hazard and perhaps should be dealt with before pursuing whomever it

{BO,BLU}The ocean here is cold, yet shallow, as it is still near the coast.
To the south a boat is run ashore and there seem to be a group of people
standing together.  Warriors by the look, in gleaming armor.  They are
facing a lone figure who bars their way.  One seems to be walking away
from the rest of the group.  This man is greater looking than all the
rest present on the shore.  The path of the dead sea creatures seems
to have ended as well.  It seems this is the group of people who
killed them, and are now trying to attain entrance to {RED}Danish {BLU}lands.
Yet the one barring them seems adamant to not let them through, although
he gives a seeming scared glance to the figure leaving the group.
This would seem most likely be the main entrance to Herot from the shore.

they can from the dead soil.  There is no wildlife in the lands, as all
the land seems to hold its breath in waiting for some event.  The
lands are open and far off to the south west a magnificant building
can be seen.  That could only be the famous mead hall of {BO,RED}Herot{bo,GR}.
To the south the {Y}coast{GR} and beyond that the {BO,BLU}ocean{bo,GR} can be
seen.

{Y}Barren {BO,G}Fields{g}~
{BO,GR}The fields are barren all around you, showing the struggle that the
{RE}Danes{GR} have endured from the strife caused the by villain {BLA}Grendel{GR}.  There
is very little life here, except for some sparse trees growing in a few
spots dotted in the area.  There is a path that has been beaten into
the ground that leads both north and to the south.  The barren waste
lays before you and far to the Southwest the mead hall of {RE}Herot{GR} can be
seen.

{Y}Road to {BO,RED}Herot{red}~
{Y}The road is bumpy and looks to have been left into disrepair.  There
is more a stir of life along the road, as {BO,RED}Danish{bo,Y} knights head toward
{BO,RED}Herot{bo,Y} in the west.  Although they look beaten, it seems they are determined
to fight until there is none of them left to defend their land against
{BO,BLA}Grendel{bo,Y}.  To the west the path branches in two directions.  One continues
westward towards {BO,RED}Herot{bo,Y}.  The other heads south into a dense fog that
cannot be seen into.{y}

Road To Herot~
The road to Herot is a sad one.  The peasants seem to be only ones keeping
up with you.  Those who have pledged their lives to Beowulf and Hrothgar are
already stationed within the keep.  To the west you can see the wide low roof
of Herot, the great Hall of Mead and Honey.  To the southeast lies the foul
sawmp, and the horror of the lands, Grendel.

{Y}Barren {BO,GR}Fields{gr}~
{Y}The fields are all dusty with only a bit of natural life.  Only a few
sturdy trees survive in a barren land which was once teaming with life.
There are a few people walking the fields.  They are either thinking of
their afterlife to come after the fight with {BO,BLA}Grendel{bo,Y}, or perhaps going
through a feeling of nostalgia of a land that was once a bountiful and
beautiful one.{y}
