     Standing under the towering tree it's lush with green leaves
and full of bright{RED} red apples{bold}. As your mouth waters, you reach to pick one. 
A branch, as if to be a hand slaps you...'Steal my{RED} apples{bold}?'  You look at a
 twisted tree trunk it looks like a face. You think to yourself, 'Can trees talk?'
