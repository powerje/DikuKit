  Softly singing acolyts and humming priests in white cloaks make

  Paladine. Here, even your fellow adventurers seem nice as

  East and south you see the gardens. West the entrance continues,

  A naked hallway leads into the living cells of the priests.
  The marble walls and cold floor impress you by their purity.
  Some potted plants are placed by the wall to break the coolness of

  South of here is the grand hall of the temple hidden by some
  curtains. To the north there is a bend in in the hallway leading out to
  the quarters of the priests.

{BO,WH}
  Facing the back side of the huge altar, the size surprises you.
  There is a table and a much welcomed chair for busy priests.
  Some relics have been placed on the table. The grand hall has 
  narrowed in to a rather small hall with room for only a few 
  persons. There are two openings in each side of the hall letting 
  in light. You hardly dare to go back out in the hall as your
  clanking in the silent hall inevitable will draw attention to you.
  North you see the end of the small hall.

  You feel very humble as you get closer and closer to the private

  he may help you. You hardly notice the graceful plants by the walls.
  The light coming through the windows blinds you and the feeling of getting
  closer to the highest authority of the believers of Paladine fills
  you with awe. To the east the feeling gets stronger and west it
  gets less pushy.
