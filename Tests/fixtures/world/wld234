{BO,W}
   All around, the fields seem desolate with the
   exception of the glimmering pond which rests to
   your north. You are mesmerized at how beautiful
   the rain dances on its blue-green surface.

   To your left you see what appears to be an old
   dusty sign. The rain continues to fall incessantly,
   eventually washing it clean. Cautiously you lean
   closer to examine what lays encrypted on its
   surface.

{BOLD}{YELLOW}A Path Into a Dense Forest{bold}{yellow}~
{G}
   You and  your  companions feel as if
   you have been traveling for days and
   days, although the sky remains dark,
   and  the forest  desolate and absent
   of any sign of life.

   After you all stop for camp you hear
   crunching of twigs and what seems to
   be  the   sound  of  whispering, but
   shrug it off as a delusion.

   You  have stayed on  the path, which
   is  to  lead to  the  mountains that
   guard  the  valley of  NeXis, but it
   seems  as  though  you  are going in
   circles.  The  winter  is   cold  in
   these parts, and  it is obvious that
   a blizzard is fast approaching.

   It seems as though   the temperature

   feel  your  extremities   begin   to
   freeze, but  you  must continue. You
   must  arrive  in  NeXis  before   it
   is  destroyed.  The  pride  you feel
   keeps you hanging on, and   although
   you are knee deep in  wet snow and a
   blizzard  is  raging  through    the
   forest, you have made progress. 

   The sounds  you  once  dismissed  as
   delusional  are  unmistakably  real.
   These sounds belong  to something or
   someone, but  the  blizzard prevents
   you from lighting your torch.

   After what seems like an eternity you have found the base of the
   Mountain. The surface is very icy and it seems nearly impossible
   to ascend to the other side. 

   With all your possessions fastened to your back, you begin to
   climb the mountain side. 
   
   You realize after climbing for a while, the ledges are very
   unstable. Even with a whisper from a comrade you hear falling

   You are in complete shock. You can no longer see the path in the
   forest from which you came, for the blizzard has consumed it
   whole.  But ahead of you, the weather is drastically different. As
   you continue to walk towards the valley,  you feel leaves crunching
   underfoot, rather than falling in 7 foot high drifts of snow.

   folded terrain in the bottom of this massive valley.
  
   You thank the Gods it is not summer time as you ride along. Even
   now, the glasslike rock around you threw up heat and shimmering
   reflections from the pallid autumn sun. Water  gathered in the
   bottoms of some of the deeper folds, but the only sign of life was

   The lake is large and round, seeming to have formed by water
   draining into the bottom of the valley from the forest and
   mountains about it.

   It seems like centuries since you had a drink of fresh clean water,
   so you squat down to take a generous gulp. A force, not unlike a
   shield prevents you from even touching the crystal clear water.
   You jump back as electric tingles rush through your body. As you
   examine the body of mystical water more closely you see a scroll
   of some sort jutting from its sandy bottom. 

   Out of curiosity and bloody frustration, you sit helplessly on  the
   stump of an ancient oak, pondering the situation.

{BO,B}Eilin's Tower - The Kitchen{bo,b}~
{BO,B}
      The Tower Gate has led straight into the kitchen, 
      which is obviously the main living area. Its walls 
      are hewn out of the dark stone of the tower's base, 
      giving it a cavelike appearance made cozy by the 
      glow of the potbellied metal stove in the corner. 
      Colored rugs of woven wool brighten the floor beneath. 
      Two chairs with padded seats are pulled up near the 
      stove, and shelves and cupbards line the walls, making 
      the most of the cramped space. Two doors hide other 
      rooms, the one on the right draws your attention.

{BO,W}Atop the Staircase{bo,w}~
{BO,W}
  Peering into the glass rooms in the tower as they 
  lead off the staircase, you see the practical purpose 
  behind the building's exuberant design. The chambers 
  are filled with benches, on which stand trays of earth 
  planted with young seedlings that bask in the warmth 
  of the afternoon sunlight trapped by the crystal walls. 
  A fine spray, seemingly appears from nowhwere, filling
  the air with moisture, your skin prickles with the buildup
  of magic. It is clear that the plants are growing before
  your very eyes.

   as usual. You see people of all classes and occupations bustling
   around you, dropping parcels, and luggage as they go.

   You think to yourself, something is amiss here. These people are
   not shopping or heading to work, they are leaving the city, you
   notice now that what you thought was a brisk walk, is a desperate
   run. All around you people trip over one another, some being
   squished under the masses. 

   You hear wails and screams, human and not so human.

   You draw your sword from its hilt and  prepare for combat!

{BOLD,BLACK}The Drunken Dog{bold,black}~
{BOLD,BLACK}
   The Drunken Dog, a typical dockside tavern if ever there was one, is the
   most squalid, insalubrious alehouse you have encountered in NeXis. Its
   windows, broken time and time again in countless brawls, have been
   nailed over with a clumsy patchwork of boards, and the taproom stinks of
   smoke and grease and unwashed bodies. The floor is slick underfoot, a
   vile morass of sawdust, spilled drink - and, more often then not, blood.
   Right now, the river is low, so the air is thick with the noxious stench of
   dead fish and sewage.

   Only the desperate dared pass into this shadowy, reeking interior of the

   lowest of the low - gangs whose haunt is the darkened alleyway, whose
   trade was the quick knife-thrust in the back and the chink of gold in a
   stolen purse. Only the homeless, stinking, red-eyed wrecks whose love of
   ale had become an addiction. Only the sorry, worn-out whores, pox-
   ridden, scarred, and too long in the tooth to make an honest living from a
   better class of client. Only those who had already sunk so low that they
   have nothing left to lose.

   Eilin was the only living mage who practiced Earth Magic and the room had been abandoned

{BO,W}Eilin's Tower - Upper Room{bo,w}~

  {W}As you enter the room you are confronted
  by Eilin. She looks none but pleased that
  you have disturbed her work to restore the
  valley to its once wonderous beauty.
  Potted flowers, plants, trees and rows of 
  sod fill the shelves on the perimeter of 
  this upper room. 
  You notice that snug to her hip is a 
  a glowing staff. Could this be one of the
  Artefacts of Power?{w}

{Y}The Beehive{y}~
{Y}
      .-=-=-=-.{W}You have stumbled into what seems to be a
    {Y}(`-=-=-=-=-`){W}Beehive! At first, all is silent but then,
    {Y}(`-=-=-=-=-`){W}you hear a murmur. Then one, tiny little bee
   {Y}( `=-=-({B}@{Y})-=` ){B}^^ {W}emerges from the entrance. You breathe a
   {Y}(`-=-=-=-=-=-`){W}sigh of relief. For a moment you thought you'd
     {Y}(`-=-=-=-`){W}be done in by a swarm of bees! But wait, you 
     {Y}(`-=-=-=-`){W}adjust your light-source, and turn around, there
       {Y}(`-=-`){W}is not only one beehive, but hundreds! You try in 
        {Y}`-==`{W}vain to quietly escape but the twigs and branches
            underfoot give you away. In panic you drop your torch, 
            igniting fallen leaves and bush. Bees begin pouring from
            from their hives, surrounding you, overwhelming you. You
             attempt to scream a cry of help, but the bees have       
          crawled into your every crevice, stifling your screams.
