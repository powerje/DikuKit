{Y}Continuing along the Trail{y}~

  {Y}Ancient stones with indecipherable runes line this path
  through this old forest.  There are dark, foreboding trees
  as far as the eye can see but no sound of birds.  The wind
  is still and all is silent.{y}

You are freezing as you stand on the sidewalk fronting the Stratosphere.  As you look upwards, you notice how tall the building is.  Your first thoughts are if you could climb to the top.
