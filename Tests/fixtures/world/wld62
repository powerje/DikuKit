Webbed Entrance~

  Sticky, Sticky, Sticky! The ground is cluttered
  with leaves, feathers, and broken twigs. Various
  remains of bugs, rats, dogs, and even a humanoid
  leg bone can be seen as well. You begin to wonder
  what lies ahead. The air is thick here and the 
  little light that shines through the canopy 
  illuminates the fine filaments that float on the
  wind.

Webby Passage~
  
  You find that footing here is very good - almost
  too good. The limbs are coated with cobwebs and 
  seem unusually strong for tree branches. Sickly
  sweet smells fill the air, which has become more
  humid. Paths lead in four directions with the
  eastern path descending ever so slightly.

Wasp Hive~

  Honeycomb in design, the walls are made of thousands of
  cells. In many of them, drones and larvae lie unmoving,
  each looking like they've been bitten. Remains of many
  unfortunate adventurers litter the room, as well. Now

  more prevalent while the air takes on a musty smell.
  The webbing grabs at your clothing and ankles, as 
  though they are living things. Faint clicking noises
  can be heard all around leading you to believe you're
  not alone.

  Everywhere you look, something moves. Many spiders
  are busy spinning new webs. A few spiders are busy
  wrapping their prey - birds, dogs, squirrels, even
  a small gnome - in webs and ordering slaves to haul
  "dinner" away. These spiders could give ants a lesson
  in efficiency.

  Hundreds of slaves are cutting the webs collecting
  the spiders food and quickly carrying it away for
  storage. Several large spiders go around tenderizing
  new morsels, while some of the smaller ones make new
  webs.

  around in an almost hypnotic, and very disgusting, fashion.

  trunk. The limbs are quite thick where they meet the trunk,
  and combined with the webbing, this looks like it would make
  a nice shelter. You feel that you can rest here safely.

  drained, but not a trace of webbing can be found on them.
  Articles of clothing hang loosely from most of the corpses,

  trees, more a collection of disjointed, silky shafts with
  leaves attached to them. Each one is sticky to the touch
  and oddly textured. Underneath one of them, is a small
  cave that leads down.

  ladder leading up. Many of the "steps" gleam with an
  inner fire. The stagnancy of the air has been replaced
  with a much fresher and more wholesome breeze. Oddly,

  in the distance.

  of spiders can be seen dangling from the webbing as

The Front Porch~

  Just as you reach the front porch, a flash
  of lightning reveals that the shack has seen 
  better days. Paint is starting to peel and
  one of the shutters hangs off the hinges. An
  oversized rocking chair sitting next to the 
  window is missing an armrest and has cushions
  that need to be restuffed and sewn. As the
  skies open up, you start pounding on the door.
  After a few seconds, the door swings open.

Mahatma's House~

  A middle aged man invites you into his humble
  home. He introduces himself as Mahatma, before
  offering to take your things. After refusing,
  he plunges a black dagger into your chest. As
  you slump to the floor, the last thing you hear
  him say is, "But I insist!"

The Entrance to the Lair of Arachnos~

  Arriving at the center of the web, you are
  amazed at how difficult it was to find this
  place. From here, you can see all the places
  you've been, though you doubt you can return
  to them. Strands of webbing form a large
  corridor heading east.

The Sticky Chamber~

  Webbing hangs from - and over - everything
  here. Things that appear to be milky white
  footballs stand out amongst the webs. The
  white orbs expand and contract at regular
  intervals. Off to one side, one of them
  bursts spewing tiny spiders everywhere.
  As you cross the room, many of them walk
  your way.

The Great Door~

  Before you stands a large door made of fine
  spider webbing framed with the bones of careless
  adventurers. Etched in to the bones are hundreds
  of ancient runes that glow with an inner fire.
  Not to be outdone, the phrase, "{BO,BLACK}Nindyn vel'uss
  kor lil Nei rytho'lel kiel lu'zolarix elg'hinn
  nindel il'tess{black}" is written in blood on the floor.

The Lair of Arachnos~

  You have finally reached the throne room of
  the Empress Spider, Arachnos. Slaves prostrate
  themselves in front of the throne in reverance
  and adoration. Chests filled with gold, silver,
  and jewels line the walls just behind the throne
  which sits on a raised dais. Surprisingly, there
  are no webs in this room.
