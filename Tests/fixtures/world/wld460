{BO,C}Lookout Point{bo,c}~
  
  
  {BO,C}An ancient oak tree stands proudly at the highest elevation
  in this region.  It is surrounded on all four sides by park
  benches.  Gas lamps line the lanes leading away from where
  you stand.  To the west at the bottom of the hill you see
  people moving their wares in and out of Bowerstone South.
  When you look to the north you see a majestic building 
  made of stone.  Two solid wooden doors fill the arched
  entrance.  A golden seal is placed on both doors, The 
  Heroes' Guild.{bo,c}

{BO,W}Heroes' Guild{bo,w}~
  
  
  {BO,W}The entrance to the Guild of Heroes is a large room topped
  by a cathedral ceiling.  In the center of the room is a huge
  topographical map of Albion.  A double staircase will lead you
  to the dorm rooms above.  Arched doorways surround the room.
  Each exit leads to another part of the guild where young 
  apprentices are training to be heroes.

  stained glass windows on the domed ceiling.  This large
  round room is where all ceremonies at the Heroes' Guild
  are held.  Unfortunately, what has happened here today
  is much more menacing.

{BO,Y}Bowerstone South{bo,y}~
  
  
  {BO,Y}Bowerstone is one of the larger towns in Ablion.  As it is 
  the town closest to the Heroes' Guild, many heroes shop here
  for supplies.  Friendly townspeople walk by you on cobbled
  lanes.  Stone buildings with thatched roofs line the street.
  The sharp sounds of metal upon metal come from the direction 
  of the town blacksmith.  Raucous laughter and jeering can be 
  heard coming from the Bowerstone Inn. {bo,y}

  considered more influential than Bowerstone South, you can't

{YELLOW}Oakvale{bold}~
 
  You stand in a dilapidated village that is shrouded in darkness.
  Between the mists and the shadows from the ancient trees you
  can make out some small run-down shacks.  As a strong wind blows
  an eerie howl whistles through the leaves.  Looking around you
  see nothing out of place, but the hairs on the back of your

  {bo,Y}This winding path takes you across the cliff between Oakvale
  and the ocean.  It's quite beautiful here.  Tall trees shade
  you from the sun.  A cool breeze comes in off the water.  The
  ocean roars as its waves hit the rocks at the bottom of the
  cliff.  Birds call to each other from the trees.  You would
  like nothing more than to find a comfortable spot and relax
  for the rest of the day.

  as they drink pint after pint of ale.  Crude steps lead up

  notice as you pass, but they take in every detail.  This is
  a highly disciplined group.  You'd best watch your step here.
