  As the Eudelta City limit is reached, the landscape

  Freshly refinished, this covered bridge is in good

  coat of varnish, but today there is talk of painting

  The closer the highway gets to the ocean, the
  less maintained the old road becomes.  The end
  of the road here is marked by the remains of a
  wooden fence, although it has long since been
  rendered ineffective by both weather and 
  wildlife to keeping anyone in or out of the beach.

{R}Dagret's Highway{r}~
 {Y}
  Just south of here, the Northern Rail Train Depot
  take passengers back and forth from Eudelta. The
  station is not terribly busy and is in need of 
  upgrading, but it is good for the use it gets. To
  the north, there is mountain path. It's believed
  that travellers once crossed the mountains to the
  north and settled here in the valley. They brought 
  little supplies, but much in the way of arts. No one
  has yet been able to successfully cross the mountains.
  So, the origin of the ancient travellers remains a 
  mystery.

{B,BO}Mountain Path{b,bo}~

  In days of old and times since past, a
  people from lands unknown travelled south 
  over the mountains and into the lands which
  are now known as Eudelta. They brought with 
  them the skills and arts of their own people.
  Over time, their arts have been lost but their
  legends remain. One day, a great student may
  rediscover these arts, and perhaps, the lands
  from whence they came.

  This mountain path appears to be travelled much

  Small critters peek out of the branches while
  the larger beasts keep their distance.

  which direction would be best?

  Suddenly snow comes whirling down over country side and town.
  Kids take their mittens and off they go, they leave the house
  to play in the snow. When they come in, they'll snuggle by the
  fire, and rule and reign in their own empire.

  The path splits east and west here.
  The trees grow shorter the colder and
  higher the mountain gets. The once 
  snow-covered mountain is now very icy.
  It is difficult to walk, but it is

  Winding up the mountain on an icy path,
  the trees grow smaller and the air grows
  colder. The reflection of the moon off the
  snow and ice is the only light available
  in the far north. Living in these conditions
  is unthinkable.

  back towards the east, and a cliff to
  the north. Some fallen rocks sit at the

  Small critters peek out of the branches while

  Bubbling up like a small geyser and running
  from the rocks whence it sprung, the water
  overflows into smooth limestone pools below.
  The crisp clear water originates from an
  underground river of melted ice and snow from
  the peaks which disappear into the heavens.
  Forest creatures of all kind stop here at the
  source to quench their thrists as the water is
  purest, cleanest, clearest at this point.

  Passing through the tall iron gates into the park,
  there is a path made up of packed dirt. Along this
  trail are benches and trees. A few flowers have been
  planted as well. To either side of the trail, families
  have gathered to enjoy the outdoors.

  Diamond Park is a wonderful place to
  take a walk. The tall trees offer shade
  while the shorter trees blossom, filling
  the air with sweet perfume. The walking 
  trail circles the park's perimeter and 
  offers information about the various
  trees, plants, and animal life found 
  within the gates.

  The park is a prized feature of Eudelta.
  Its unsurpassed beauty is the reason it
  is called Diamond Park. Here near the
  center of the park is the Park Museum.
  Within the museum lie the mysteries of
  Eudelta's natural beauty and its people.
  Updated regularly, the Park Museum holds
  the attention of all year after year.

  This is the only entrance to Diamond Park 
  that is large enough to get a vehicle through.
  The gate here is wider and guarded by the park
  rangers. Only authorized vehicles can enter the
  park. This park is protected by the local 
  government as a historical landmark. With great
  meeting halls in the center of the park, a duck
  pond, Castle Playground, gardens and amazing 
  picnic grounds, the park is in no real danger of 
  destruction.

  Time seems to stand still when people
  are happy. Diamond Park is timeless.
  Year after year, the park fills with
  people wearing big smiles. The old and
  young gather here to enjoy the outdoors
  togther and share stories of life. Some
  escape the daily pressures of life while
  jogging or attending a concert. One thing 
  is certain, not a single unhappy face can
  be found.

  At the center of the park is Park Plaza.
  Like all things in Eudelta, Park Plaza is
  a bit overdone with a large sports complex
  and concert hall. Not far from Eudelta Square,
  Park Plaza makes a great entertainment center 
  for the city. The landscaping lends to the 
  relaxing atmosphere while making the park a 
  favourite place to bike, run, walk, explore, 
  celebrate, and read. All are welcome and 
  admission is always free.

  It seems like hundreds of Eudelta's youngest
  warriors have gathered here to conquer Diamond
  Park's Castle. The massive play center is a 
  jumble of slides, tunnels, ladders, rope swings,
  and wood chips, lots of wood chips. The youngsters
  rush here and there making sounds that only they
  seem to comprehend. Friendships are instant and
  time is endless on this playground.

  an elderly citizen of Eudelta tosses
  pieces of stale bread to the mallards.
  A small boy floats his boat on the pond{bo,BLU}

  A young couple stares dreamily at one
