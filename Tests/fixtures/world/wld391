    preventing access into the cabin. On the top of the

{BOLD,BLUE}Mutant Concentration Camp{bold,blue}~
 {BLUE,BOLD}
   In the near distant future, mutants are hunted down like dogs.
   30 foot robot sentinels hunt down these mutants and place them
   here in concentration camps similar to those in World War II.
   Guarding the prisoners in the camps are mutant hounds, mutants
   converted to mindless zombies controlled by a human master. The
   camps are not maintained and very filthy. If the hounds and the
   camps doesn't kill them, the pollution will.
