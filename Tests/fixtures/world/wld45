--------A World in Turmoil--------~
 
     The line of the family of Kildar was a strong and long
line.  Members of the house of Kildar ruled this land since
the dawn of time.  However, 100 years ago, King Gronaud made
a deal with the Demon K'est Lufia.  This pact gave Gronaud a
suit of armor with unlimited power which enabled him to defeat
all his enemies and expand the kingdom of Kildar.  Payment 
however was to be collected a century later which is now the
present.

--------The Fall of a Warrior--------~
 
    Krondar was the strongest king in the line of Kildar since Gronaud.  
He ruled his kingdom with a strong arm and a strong head.  Treaties had 
been made with other very strong kingdoms which enabled him to accumulate 
his power.  His kingdom was at peace.  Then one night in a dream, Krondar 
had a vision of a vile demon which had come to take his soul.  Consulting 
his mystic, Krondar learned that the Demon K'est Lufia has returned for his 
payment.

     A large band of monsters had appeared in the land.  Led by the powers 
of K'est Lufia, the monsters razed the castle.  K'est Lufia collected his 
fee, the soul of Krondar.  The Mystical Suit of K'est Lufia was destroyed 
in a struggle by the leaders of the monsters.  Each leader taking a piece 
of the armor as his own.

--------The Legend of the Magician--------~
 
     Now, the castle is in ruins and the power of the house of Kildar 
divided.  In all of this death and destruction arises a legend.  A 
legend of a powerful magician who can do wonderous things.
The legend holds that he is hidden deep within the heart of the ruins, 
guarded from the monsters by his magical 
creations.

Decisions, Decisions~
 
     You are in the middle of a large field.  This area has been ravaged 
and destroyed by great battles.  To the north is the ruins of what appears 
to have been a beautiful castle.  The castle appears to have had critical 
military position, flanked on the northern side by mountains, an immense 
lake to the west and a large forest to the east of it.  Attackers would 
have had to come from the south in order to make an assault on this 
castle.  You see a black tower high in the sky far to the east.  To the 
south, you see a large cross towering in the distance.  
 
     There are trails in all four directions.  There is high underbrush and 
weeds around the path.  It appears that you could easily get lost if you 
don't stick to the trails.  A sign that has been partially burned and has 
blood stains on it lies on the ground.  It might still be legible in areas
though.

the mountains.  The undergrowth prevents all travel to the west or south.  
The immensity of the mountains makes you feel so small and worthless.  But 
you can tackle those mountains, just work at it one step at a time.

dead bodies and fallen ladders scattered along the castle walls.  You 
sense that there are still occupants in this castle as you hear commotion 
from within and a fury of arrows are launched from the high castle walls 
towards you.
 
     As you rush for the archway, it seems to come alive and the great 
door begins to move, opening, allowing a band of horrid looking creatures 
out of the castle before slamming shut again.  What kind of magic is this?

voice is in your head.

of all vampires.  With this belt and cloak, I will never be beaten."  With

The Castle Ruins~
 
     You are in the southwest corner of the ruined castle.  There is a huge 
hole in the west wall caused by the large boulder that is in the center of 
this area.  You hear activity and shouts from people in a strange 
language.  It sounds as if they are calling an attack.  You better move 
quick!

     This castle is in shambles.  Rubble lies everywhere in large piles.  
There are dead bodies of knights and creatures alike sprawled along the 
floor.  From behind one of the huge piles of rubble jump a band of 
heunmyrs.   They surround you cutting off your escape.

     You run through the castle gates, for fear that it will crumble on top 
of you.  You look around and this whole area of the castle is in shambles.  
Rubble and bodies are everywhere.  You hear a loud sound which sounds like 
a call to arms.  Looks like someone noticed that you are here.

     This part of the castle appears to have been the most ravaged by the 
war that occurred.  The walls are destroyed, apparently from the large 
boulders that lie all around.  The boulders are still moving, strange.  
Suddenly, one of the boulders rolls uncurls and you see a large beast, it's 
back made of the rock.  This must be one of the legendary kistravens, 
beasts of indestructible hides.

     The wall here is totally destroyed.  You can see the mountains to the 
east and the plains to the west.  It appears that you can climb over the 
rock to reach the plains.  The stench of burnt flesh permeates the air 
here as you see a large pile of burnt bones in the corner.

have attacked this place to cause this much damage.  It seems as if nothing 
was left unscathed.  Looking around, you see the body of a little child 
within the arms of a larger skeleton.  The sight angers you to the point of 
infernal rage.

still glow with intensity in the daylight.  Shimmering, the chandelier 
casts multiple colors around the room.  Entranced by the colors, you fail 
to notice the large group of heunmyrs and their mounts, the firktorks, 
surround you.

     The northwestern corner of the castle appears to have remained intact 
from the battle.  It must be because it was so far away from the entrance, 
or the fact that there was nothing here to destroy.  This area is barren, 
devoid of clutter.

     An enormous pile of bones makes you feel disgusted.  The bones of 
humans and beasts alike are piled here.  You can't believe that this many 
people lost their lives here.  You are saddened by the fact that all this 
life was destroyed.  Movement from within the pile catches your attention 
as you see some of the skeletons start to move.

Counting his treasure and loot, he turns to look at you as you 
enter.  You will never get my treasure!  he screams.  Suddenly, 
he reaches down and grabs a knight's helm and dons it.  His body 
is immediately transformed into a hideous demonic creature.  
What kind of helmet is that?

        You are nearing what appears to be the tent of the leader.  
You see a very large tent to the south.  If you can only fight your 
way there, maybe you can take out the head honcho.

In the Camp~
 
        You are in the southwestern corner of the camp.  You are 
surrounded by Wagrauts running out of their tents brandishing 
weapons.  Uh-oh.
