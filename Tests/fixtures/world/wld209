{BOLD,BLACK}An Old Shack{g}~
   This small shack is hardly decorated with anything. Its walls
have only a few shelves along them fill with only herbs. Off in
the corner is a small bed and a stand. You wonder who lives here?

{BOLD,BLACK}The ruins of the temple Vaulter{b}~

   These are the ruins of a once mighty temple. Its ruins seem to glow
blue warning evil to stay away. I wonder who or what destroyed this temple? 
It must of been a force of evil unknown to this mortal world. You notice something
that looks like a door beneath the rubble. Where could it lead?

   You are surrounded by darkness. The only direction you can go now is down,
down into the abyss. Strange sounds come from below you.....

{BOLD,BLACK}Intersection{b}~
   You stand at the crossroads of two underground tunnels. Each
heading to a unknown destination. What adventures lie ahead of you? Well you
are not going to find out by standing here the whole time.
