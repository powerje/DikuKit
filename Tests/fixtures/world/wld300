Kombat Prep Room..(glow)..(hum)~

  As you glance around the Kombat Prep Room you notice all the
other fighters sharpening their blades and praying to their selected
gods. Now would be a good time for you to do the same because
stepping into the arena unprepared could be fatal.
  A small elderly man steps forward and speaks out to the group,

     "Shortly each of you will be positioned somewhere within
      the kombat arena. This will be your starting position from
      which you will proceed to hunt down and defeat all other
      fighters in the arena. The last remaining fighter will be
      our Mortal Kombat Champion."

  The old man then bows his head and is gone.

The Golden Temple of Midgaard~
  You are in the southern end of the temple hall in the Temple of Midgaard.

appearance, and most of the walls are covered by ancient wall paintings 
depicting Gods, Giants and peasants.

mound upon which the temple is built and ends on the temple square to the
south.   The temple continues further to the west.
   To the east you can see what was once the donation room. You see a note

The Man In The Arena~

  It's not the critic who counts. Not the one who points out
how the strong man stumbled or how the doer of the deeds might
have done them better.
  The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena;
whose face is marred by blood, sweat and dust, who strives
valiantly but errs and comes short again and again because there
is no human endeavor without shortcoming; who knows the great
enthusiasms - great devotions, and who; If he wins knows the
triumphs of high achievement and who, if his efforts are
checkered by defeat, at least fails while daring greatly so
that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls
who never knew victory nor defeat.

On the windy traverse~
  So - now you have it! You are standing on a traverse at least 50 meters
above Midgaard.  As always in this town, the wind blows.  It tugs on your
clothes and for a moment it seems that you loose your balance!  Better get
quick to a saver place.  But mind your steps!

The belfry is made of wood and doesn't look as if it would become much
older. The beams groan with the high weight of the bells. Better don't
touch them.

The huge column~
  On the eastern side of this room you see a impressingly huge column
made of white marble. It's surface is polished and shimmers in the light.
As you examine it closer you can't discover even one little chamfer. You
can go north and south.

The clockwork of the Temple~
  On the eastern side of this room you see a gigantic clockwork.  It's
parts seem to be made of brass.  The golden shimmering surfaces look
phantastic as the uncountable number of gear-wheels move.  On the west side
of the roof you discover a little trap-door.

  You're really a hopeless optimist!  Do you think you can make such a

On the 2nd windy traverse~
  You're really a hopeless optimist! Do you think you can make such a
balance tour again? Well, the traverse leads slightly down to the east. The
wind tries to help you to make your last step. As you look west, you see
the roof of the nave. The shingles shimmer in all colours of the rainbow
but don't look very inviting to walk on. They look VERY old!

Good that you have chosen the save way! As you examine the shingles you see
they won't be sturdy enough to carry your weight. Better bring something
along to be able to fly if you want to go further west.

story goes the golem lives again. Don't let the gloriol mislead you!

But even flying isn't easy here because of the heavy wind. Better land
