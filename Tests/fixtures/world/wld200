{W,BO}Entrance to Flea's Cube Maze{w,bo}~

  {W,BO}Underneath the undergrowth here, set inside of an ancient hill, you can
  barely make out the surface of a very old, very large, rusted metal
  door with a simple metal latch.  Even from out here, the sounds of someone
  or something scraping the walls inside can easily be heard.  Very little
  light illuminates this place, making it hard to see.  It smells old,
  musty and rotten all around here as if no one's been here in a VERY long
  time.{w,bo}

  {W,BO}You are standing in a room with exits leading in almost all
  possible directions.  All exits lead into an eerie, magical darkness
  from which the sounds of creatures stirring can be heard.  The room
  itself is carved from a fine, well crafted, marble substance.  The
  walls, floor, and ceiling are all perfectly smooth and clear of any
  kind of debris or obstacles.  Something you find very uncommon...{w,bo}

  lead into darkness.  The room itself though is brightly lit with a soft, 
  pale light which seems to feel almost holy.  The light is warm and

  there are no exits to the east and south sections of the room
  It would seem that this might actually be in the shape of a real,
  three dimensional cube.  The darkness here seems to envelop you,
  while the eerie silence now seems disturbing.{w,bo}

{BLUE}Inside the Maze{blue}~

  {W,BO}This room is very similar to other rooms in the maze; in that
  it's a perfect cube, is unnaturally dark, and sounds of creatures
  can be heard from down the halls.  There is one difference,
  however, there are no exits leading north, west, or down.{w,bo}
