(BoD) the shrine of the brothers of destuction (BoD)~
 
   
   A foul stench invades your nostrils and fills you with a 
   sick, disgusted feeling. The scent of death which is
   nauseating for you is the sweet smell of victory to the 
   Brothers of Destruction. Bodyparts of the Brother's enemies
   litter the floor and the walls are stained by the blood of 
   these puny enemies.

{BO,BLA}   Darkness envelops you as you make your way down this
   narrow tunnel. You detect a{RE} grotesque smell {BLA}coming from
   the {BLU}water{BLA} you are up to your knees in.  A shiver runs
   through your {bo,bla}{WH}spine{BO,BLA} as you hear the echo of the faint
   sound of some little critter's feet scurrying down the
   tunnel.{bo,bla}

The Office Of Vernon Fenwick~

      Vernon has multiple jobs, which of course
      makes him a much better reporter than his 
      coworker, April O' Neil. He is both a 
      television news reporter and sometimes he
      acts as the Program Manager. He's SO
      Multi-Taskable! Except sometimes that evil
      April O' Neil forces him to be her cameraman!
      Oh The Humanity! Such excellent talent wasted
      on being just a simple camera man! Now if
      April was out of the way, I'm sure Vernon
      would be Channel 6's Star Reporter.

      You get the feeling that this office belongs
      to the head honcho of Channel Six and you're
      proven correct as you see a gold nameplate 
      with the words:
                   
                    
                    BERN TOMPSON
                      PRESIDENT
     
      
      Pictures of a short man with blonde hair
      and a funny looking nose adorn the walls.
      You take it that this is the infamous 
      Mr. Tompson.

(6)(6)(6) Main News Room (6)(6)(6)~
      
      A long desk sits in the center of the room
      with a blue-screen behind it. This is where
      the TV anchors sit and inform the populace 
      of all the latebreaking news. On the other
      side of the room you see a map of the country
      with the word "WEATHER" on the top corner. So
      this is what it feels like to work as a news
      anchor!

April O' Neil's Office/Dressing Room~
     
      What a mess! For being Channel 6's Employee
      Of The Month's office this sure is a hellhole!
      It looks like somebody came in here with a 
      chainsaw and let loose! Overturned desks and 
      chairs litter the floor. A huge hole has been
      made on the western wall. Where is April O' Neil? 
      
      
      Uh-Oh... Looks like it's your job to find 
      her. Where to start? You might find the
      answer on the note that April left here.

An Abandoned Corridor In The Teckno-Drome~

      As soon as you continue you realize your
      feet were a little too anxious. I guess they
      didn't see the huge hole in the ground. Oh
      well... FORGET THIS ZONE AND GO DO TIMEQUEST!

The Foot Elite HQ~
      
      You see the words "Foot Elite" painted on
      the walls of this room in purple and black
      letters. There is a display of former uniforms
      here also but the uniforms look more well
      made and have the letters "FE" on the right
      shoulder. A large sign adorns a wall with.
      You take a closer look at it...
     
      "There are many ranks among the Foot. Most
      are of the most common rank, that of a soldier.
      As my brothers and sisters progress, we are
      elevated to the next rank. Each Soldier battles
      their way through each rank in the attempt to
      become Foot Elite. There can only be twelve elite,
      and to become one you must defeat the lowest ranking
      twelve in a mortal combat. Thus the Elite truly
      are the finest Ninjas to walk the earth. Battle
      worn and tested, the goal of every soldier is to become 
      one of the ELITE."

The Teckno-Drome Control Room~
      
      Many high-tech gadgets and gizmos adorn
      the metallic walls of this spacious room.
      Two huge screens, one of a map of the town
      and the other of a surveillance camera's
      view on the Ninja Turtles new secret hideout.
      You think of hooking one of these computers
      up with Zmud and playing some kick ass Northern
      Crossroads but stop when you hear the scrape
      of metal on metal and realize Shredder has 
      found you!

Without You~
           
           If I could touch your cheek again
          And kiss away every one of your tears
                To wash away sad memories
           And look forward to our better years
                           ...
              I never meant to make you cry 
       I never wanted you to know sadness or pain
   If I could shape your life and make it as perfect as you
       I'd never look back - I'd never see you again
