Welcome to the Veleusian Palace!  Before you get started,
I want to warn you that this zone is for mid to high 
advanced characters.  There are some pretty nasty mobs up
ahead and I don't want for you duals or lower advanced to
get confused and think this is a place to level or anything.
I congratulate you on finding this wonderful place, and I 
hope that it is a productive and rewarding experience for
each person in your group.

God's Speed,
Rathus (the creator)

You stand awestruck and amazed at the many riches of 
this magnificent place.  The grass is perfectly manicured
to exactly one and a half inches per blade.  You see
servants with scissors and rulers measuring each blade
and paying meticulous attention to every rise and fall of
the ground to adjust the grass appropriately.  In the distance
you see a golden glow and nearer to you, you see a dull grey 
structure pointing to the sky.

travellers who once ventured too close to the dragon.  Legend
has it that the dragon which infests these halls breathes ice
so cold, it freezes the air into razor sharp crystals of ice
which fly into the person's skull.  The crystals then turn
into teeth which eat the person's brain from the inside out. 
Then the dragon turns. Their accomplices are so horrified
they are frozen first with fear, then with ice.

{BO}{C}Crystalized Morgue{c}~

As you walk down this cold dull hall, you see what appears to be
bodies cast in granite.  Apparently the bodies were those of 
travellers who once ventured too close to the dragon.  Legend
has it that the dragon which infests these halls breathes ice
so cold, it freezes the air into razor sharp crystals of ice
which fly into the person's skull.  The crystals then turn
into teeth which eat the person's brain from the inside out. 
Then the dragon turns. Their accomplices are so horrified
they are frozen first with fear, then with ice.

{BO}{G}Second Floor of the Tower{g}~

You start to learn that this place is circular and confusing.
The second floor doesn't seem quite as wet as the rest of the
floors, however its still swarming with hideous animal life and
odd looking things not of this world.  Lets take out our biology
kit and dissect them.

Your eyes slowly readjust as you find that the only light
in the room is an orange safelight which casts an
eerie glow on a figure moving in the background.  His
acrid screams of horror and disbelief echo in the lab as
he discovers that his final project is ruined.  A fire starts
to burn around his head and its intense heat begins to set the
lab on fire.  The fire burns so intensely, it seems as if it will
