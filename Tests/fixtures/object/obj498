  Eudelta was founded in a time when the people
  of the Crossroads demanded change. This change
  was a good one. Eudelta is a full service city
  which features an intercity subway, train system,
  shops, trainers, postal service, etc. While in
  town be sure to visit the park and the beach. 
  Most of all enjoy your stay. Hope to see you here.
