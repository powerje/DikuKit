knife chef~
This Chef knife appears it was meant to cut many things.  It is very good
steel, and appears to be sharper than a razor.  It sparkles with fresh
blood on it.  Human blood.

Teddy Bear~
This teddy is no ordinary Teddy .. it's Mega-teddy .. Or the Teddy-A-Nator.
He is soft and cuddly, but at the same time, he is small enough to fit in 
the palm of your hand.  Interesting.

Shocker~
This is THE shocker.  It has two little places where you can put your 
fingers, to receive a shock.  There is a gauge which appears to be the 
amount of electricity it shocks with or something.  It has the ranks 1-9.
You imagine what would happen if you tried it on 9, you would probably die.

racket tennis graphite~
This is a very modern tennis racket, very well made.  It is gray-colored,
and weighs about 5 ounces, very light.  You think how well you could parry,
and hit at the same time with this, this may actually come in handy, imagine
that, slaying a dragon with a tennis racket ..

This case holds a large Fillet knife, which seems to have great power, which
you dont know how to describe, you can just tell it was a gift blessed from
the gods.  It is some of the best German steel in existence.  This is the 
key to power . .
