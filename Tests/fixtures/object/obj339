Purity Holy Sword Serenity~

  {W}This weapon was not created by Flea but was used by him
  throughout his adventuring career.  Legend has it that
  this dagger was forged from the blood of murder victims
  and some kind of supernatural poison.  It has a wavy, dull
  grey blade with an ivory hilt inlaid with a large bloodstone
  gem.  It's extremely light and very well balanced as well
  as easily concealable, a perfect assassins weapon.

  {C}This fountain was apparently, at one time, crafted into the shape of a
  feminine form.  Of what she was made to look like or what her race was
  suppose to be is now lost. Pieces of the fountain lie scattered next to
  it, and the urn in which the liquid flows out of is cracked.  It's
  impossible to tell how old it is because of the damage it has sustained.{c}

statue flea obsidian~

  {B,BO}Flea was the powerful archmage who created this magical nightmare
  simply referred to as Flea's cube maze.  Legend says that Flea had
  made several powerful artifacts in his day, but by making these
  artifacts he was driven insane.  As his sanity gave way he constructed
  the maze to keep looters out and locked his treasures behind a
  magically locked and hidden door within it.  The statue seems nearly
  lifelike at nearly six and one half feet tall.  He is wearing
  flowing robes, has shoulder length hair and gaze as if he's in
  deep concentration.  Under his left arm is a thick book covered in
  ornate runes.  In his upheld right hand, which seems to be pointing
  up and eastwards, is clutched a rusting bronze key.  This seems
  strange as this key is the only thing on the statue not made of
  obsidian and it doesn't look like it could have been put there.{b,bo}

  staff is a blood stone which also glows, seperate from the staff
  and seems to be brighter and radiate more power than you can

book~

  {R}This book is made of obsidian, much like the rest of
  the statue but there are a few things to take note of.
  First, a small inscription which reads:

  {C}"I have not long to live, but I finally found the secret
  to the vault of Flea.  Trace the runes to find what you
  seek and take what I could not...."

  {R}The inscription is not signed but it seems to give
  great insight as to what you must do.  The other strange
  thing about the book are the intricate runes which
  cover it, making what looks like to be the letter {W,BO}"{bo,R}F{W,BO}"{w,bo}
