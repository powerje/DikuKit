  Sadly enough, some mudders have given up their
  musical talents to mud. The time spent practicing
  beautiful music has been spent zoning and levelling
  while their instrument collected dust. One day in an
  act of desperation for some coins, the instruments have
  been cashed in one by one to afford better equipment,
  con, and the like.

Reviewing101 pamphlet~
{WH}
  So you are ready to review!
{C}
  Welcome aboard! 
{W}
  In this pamphlet you will find some basic, VERY basic,
  steps to reviewing. They are by NO means the ONLY things
  you could, would or should do during the review process,
  but it will give you a great stepping off point.
{C}
  Type look 1-5, 6-8, 9-12, 13-15, 16-18 to learn How To Review.
{c}
~
E
1-5~
{WH}
1. Let everyone know that you are starting the review by
   a. posting on review board
   b. contacting the creator
{C} 
2. Talk to the creator. Find out if it will be better to 
   communicate by mudmail or e-mail. Find out if there 
   are procs and how they work. Ask the creator to share
   any information that might be vital to the review like...
   which room does the zone start with? Not all zones start
   at 00. Find out what size group and what level the zone
   is intended for.
{WH} 
3. Walk through the zone as if you were going to actually zone.
   See if it has a logical progression and basic playability
   (all links work and clues are sufficient to navigate the
   zone).
{C} 
4. Go to each room and check the spellings. Check for ddesc and 
   edescs and the spellings. Run it through word if you stink
   at spelling. 
{WH} 
5. Check the rlevel of each room. Check the room flags. Check
   darklevel. Check the sector. 
{w}
~
E
6-8~
{C}
6. Remember to make note of anything that doesn't seem to work or
   fit into the zone's level.
{W}
7. As you walked the zone, you came across mobs and objects. Go
   back and ask yourself if these mobs are appropriate for the 
   zone's level. Mstat each mob checking each stat. If you dislike
   something about the mob because it makes the mob too hard or
   too easy, unfair, or ridiculous let the creator know. 
{C}
8. While looking at the mobs, check the spellings. Are the descriptions
   of each mob sufficient. Keep in mind this might vary. Most people
   don't spend 3 hours looking at an aggro mob so the descs might be
   a little shorter or not as detailed. EVERY MOB SHOULD HAVE A DESC!

9. Objects too. Do the stats match the level of difficulty of the
   zone and mob that it is on? Is it TOO good or not good enough?
   If it doesn't match have them change the stats.
   While this zone was created by another person it is YOUR job to see
   that it is quality and sensible. If you aren't sure about an object
   ask another reviewer for advice and/or compare it to other similar
   objects out there. Check the objects spelling as well.
{C}
10. Do the keys in the zone match the doors and vise versa? Are they 
    all loaded?
{W}
11. If there are objects on the ground DO THEY BELONG THERE?
{C}
12. Remember to show m ### and show o ###... some things may NOT be 
    loaded on purpose. Check those items out. IF it is a godtoy is it
    tagged as such in the name? Are other items quest items? Just because 
    it is not loaded in the zone doesn't mean you aren't responsible for
    looking it over and questioning it.

13. Did I mention that colours should not be permitted to bleed? If you
    don't know what that means... ask.
{CY}
14. At this point, you have written quite a bit about the zone. You've
    written changes for mobs, objects, rooms, and the zone. You've put 
    hours NOT minutes into this review... GO BACK AND WALK IT AGAIN! Double
    check your work so that others don't have to. Remember if you are an
    EMP a dic, god, and exec are going to see what you have done and haven't
    done to improve the zone's quality. Likewise, dics answer to god+ and the
    gods are checked by the exec who answers only to the comm...

15. Send the changes to the creator and POST the changes on the review board
    in room 2006.

16. The creator must then make changes. Some creators will try to ignore certain
    change requests. Don't give your ok if you are NOT OK with the way the zone
    looks. If the creator is giving you a rough time about changing things, let
    a higher ranking reviewer know. It's ok to bargain, give either or options,
    and listen to the creator's reasons and sob stories... BUT... you have the
    final say on whether or not you ok the zone to move to the next review.
{W}
17. Before the zone can be handed up to the next review you need to check the 
    changes and ok the zone. Let the creator know that you are cool with it and
    post on the board again that the zone has you ok. It will then be added
    to the BREAKDOWN and move to the next review.

18. IF YOU NEED HELP ASK!

Purpose- to help organize the mud by offering a place for new zones to be linked with the
possiblility of relinking zones that take forever to walk to or are just TOO far from Market
Square, to separate zones more logically in terms of newbie verses advanced zones , modern 
verses medieval themes.

Eudelta- The new city was named after much debate. Eudelta is a combination of Eu meaning 
good and Delta meaning change to emphasize that this city is a BIG change for NC but it is
one that has good intentions and purpose. 
{M}
Size- The LS is 6 zones big... 493, 494, 495, 496, 497, 498. The 600 rooms include forests, mountains, river, lakes, ocean, a new city, and marshy area.
{W}
Highlights of LS- will be linked west of great tree. has a variety of landscaping, many hidden rooms and fun discoveries, fully functional city with a variety of services from armourery to restraurants to guilds, sports complex, town square, miles of highways.
{C}
Completion- the room descs are done, mobs and objects are in the works. We are looking at another month maybe two before it can undergo review.

                               *INVITATION*
Though this is a work in progress, we encourage ALL to walk the LS and ask questions as they 
arise.
