staff ivory~
  
  This staff seems to be made of ivory, perhaps carved from 
  a single piece of a great animal's tusk. It seems ancient
  and stained, but the intricate relief carving seems 
  unaltered by time.
  
  The staff is about four feet long, and covered with strange
  hieroglyphs, which you cannot decode. The handle of the 
  staff is covered in would red leather, and has a comfortable
  grip. The end of the staff is fashioned into the head of
  a venomous serpent.

laser helium neon~

  {W}Made of some indestructible alloy, this laser seems
  to be powerful enough to vaporize dragon scale, and seems
  to have a virtually unlimited supply of power.  It has some
  very unpredictable properties as well, so let the gunner
  beware!
