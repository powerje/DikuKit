help~

{G}  One of the most useful resources for becoming familiar with NC's
{G}  commands is the NC help files.  The help files cover a broad range
{G}  of topics, from basic commands, to skill information, to rules and
{G}  other useful information.
{G}  
{G}   help         {b}- {CYAN}Displays a list of basic help topics
{G}   help <topic> {b}- {CYAN}Provides additional information for using help
{G}  
{G}  Help (topic) is the syntax for finding information about any given
{G}  topic.  'help look' for instances gives the different syntax for
{G}  using the look command.  There are help files for nearly all commands,
{G}  so be sure to try it out whenever you need help.{g}

{Y}   auto split{b} - {CYAN}splits gold with the players in your group.
{Y}   auto gold{b}  - {CYAN}gets any gold from the mobs you kill.
{Y}
{Y}  NC can be greater appreciated in colour.  Unfortunately not all
{Y}  telnet programs support ANSI colours, so try and see if colour
{Y}  will work for you.
{Y}
{Y}   colour active{b} - {CYAN}activates colour
{Y}   colour off{b}    - {CYAN}deactivates colour
{Y}   colour def #{b}  - {CYAN}sets a default colour scheme  (# is 1-5)
{Y}
{Y}  There is also an extensive list of prompts to choose from
{Y}  to personalize your character.  Currently, there are up to
{Y}  28 prompts to choose from, or, make your own!
