helmet juggernaut~
{YELLOW}
   Protected by that Crimson Gem of Cyttorak, Juggernaut is the 
   unmovable force. His super-strength, combined with his total
   invulnerability make him nearly unstoppable. His only weakness 
   is psychic attacks, if his helmet is off. Otherwise, get out of 
   the way!

bio armor Apocalpse~
{BLUE}
   Apocalypse stayed in the ship for a few thousand years, learning the 
   secrets of Celestial technology and devising a bio-armor for himself, 
   among other things. This armor appears to be part of his body and can
   change form, adding mass from some extra-dimensional source to increase 
   in size, among other things.
