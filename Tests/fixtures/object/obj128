Head Bio-Wizard,

     A mysterious DPORTAL has appeared in Splynn's zoo, by order of his
excellence Lord Splynncryth, you will create a new bio-borg to explore
the other side of the rift. Our scientists believe the other dimension
is called wormwood, it's still a mystery to us and appears highly
dangerous, spare no expense in creating a proper scout. I will retain
the key to the zoo until your task is completed.
