UK Ideas~
  
   
   The ideas that each and every {BO,BLUE}({G}UK{BO,BLUE}){bo,blue} club member should respect are as follows:
   
    1.  Pker's should consider PKing as they do Kombat and Chaos, they merely
        choose to do it all the time.  PKing should be viewed as a game not
        as an act of vengeance or cruelty.
    2.  No PK chars will zone with the club.  This is to insure everyone's 
        safety.
    3.  During chaos or while PKing you will always allow the person you 
        attack to get their corpse back.
    4.  If a club member is ever attacked, for any reason what-so-ever, you
        will be immediately evicted from UK.
    5.  Remember that the first obligation of this club is to help.  We are
        not here to wreck havoc.  You will not attack any players new to the
        mud.  After Chaos is over you will help others locate and retrieve 
        their eq.
   
   These are general ideas.  We are always open to new ideas.

  And all the backpack niggaz loved me like Mos Def
  I'd probably be a cool-ass nigga like Ice Cube
  Picture me in this flick right now lookin so cool
  What if I was a low-key nigga, just laid back?
  Hustle to keep a homey 'round, somebody to hold the gat
  Man what if Halle Berry was my next baby moms?

  I blew out my flip flop,
  Stepped on a pop top
  Cut my heel, had to cruise on back home.
  But there's booze in the blender,
  And soon it will render
  That frozen concoction that helps me hang on.

  It's every little thing you do
  That makes me fall in love with you
  There isn't a way that I can show you 
  Ever since I've come to know you
  It's every little thing you say
  That makes me wanna feel this way
  There's not a thing that I can point to
  'Cause it's every little thing you do

Heavy Metallic Element~


  You see a hard brittle blue-gray metallic element.
  It's very heavy and would be impossible for you to 
  move.
