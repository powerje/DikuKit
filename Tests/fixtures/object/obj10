assortment of things to kill.  These creatures are intended for
players level 10 to level 15.  If you notice that this area is
a little too dangerous ask on gossip for someone to come and
help you out or bring some scrolls of recall from the Magic Shop.

throne chair iron~

  {BLA}{BOL}The Iron Throne is an assymetric monstrosity of spikes and jagged
  edges and twisted metal. It is uncomfortable, and the back is
  fanged with steel which makes leaning back impossible. Aegon I 
  had it made this way deliberately, saying that a king should never
  sit easy. King Aerys II Targaryen, the "Mad King," was always 
  cutting himself upon it, and it is said that the throne itself
  has caused the deaths of several people.{bla}{bold}
