{BLUE,BOLD}This is how it works....

You will be given a list of secret scrambled codes, to names
of valued spy items and secrets hidden around the mud.  Your
job, as a professional NC spy, is to descramble these codes
with the help of your trusty Secret Spy Decoder Ring, and
recover the items to gain the title of Super-Spy.
First though, you must search for a Secret Spy Decoder Ring
so that you can accomplish your task and {bold}{BLU}unlock the secrets.
{BLUE,BOLD}have fun, and remember that {bol}{RED}PKing{BLUE,BOLD} is NOT permitted during this quest.
(Hint: Only unlocked secrets are useful to our organization)

them before they can get you.
During the Sleep Tag Quest, there will be no leaving the zone
while it's running or you WILL be disqualified.  If you
are put to sleep then let me know and i will transfer and wake
you where you can wait until the next round if you so choose.
Please note, Do not kill anyone, use cloak/shadow, or cast
other offensive spells(includes blind, guinness, silence etc.) 
during the Event.
Now go hide and start when I say!
