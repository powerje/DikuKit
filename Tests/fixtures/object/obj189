  Good Warriors and Adventurers of Midgaard,
  recently, several demonic beings have been
  spotted traveling around the perimeter of
  our fair town.  Please be on the lookout
  for any strange figures.  Several dozen of
  our most valiant cityguards, and an entire
  legion of Elite Guards were found mutilated
  last week, their heads piled upon eachother,
  and the flesh rendered from their bones.  
  The rainman mumbled something about Pins 
  And a head... The authorities were unable to
  decipher his meaning.

  Please stay alert, and be prepared.  Things
  of this nature have not bode well for our 
  town in the past!  A raid could be immenent!

brotherhood armor stars~


  {RED,BO}This armor originally belonged to the almighty {BLA}Bielnack{r}{RED,BO}.
  The blood of countless enemies has been splashed upon the 
  cold steel.  When Bielnack  passed his armor  down to his
  heir  Jaskin, he  hired a  skilled druid  by the  name of 
  {r}{RED}R{BO}i{r}{RED}o{BO}t{r}{RED}s{BO}t{r}{RED}a{BO}r{r}{RED}t{BO}e{r}{RED}r{BO}  to cast a magical  enchantment on the armor,
  ensuring  that  it will always be protected  by the power 
  of the {YEL}s{r}{YEL}t{BO}a{r}{YEL}r{BO}s{RED}.{r}
