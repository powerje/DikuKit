pointy hat made of{white} {BO,BLUE}blue felt{blue}{BO,WHITE}. As you reach for it,
the decorations start to glow. You remember old stories
of wizards who used extra-dimensional pockets to store
things and wonder if this hat serves as a focal point
for such a thing.

ring coal circle~

{BO,BLACK}This ring appears to be made from coal and is speckled
with flecks of onyx. There is an inscription engraved
on the inside of the ring. It is nearly indecipherable,
however you can make out the word, "Sussan'yacal".

visor black knight's~
{BO,BLACK}It's apparent this visor has survived many battles.
While bent in a few places, it still looks like it
will protect your head or face sufficiently. It's
likely with some polish, you can make it's dark 
metallic surface gleam again.

{WHITE}This poor adventurer lies here unmoving. A giant hole
is located just below the right shoulder. Foam is
running from the corner of his mouth and it's eyes
have glazed over. Better take what this poor guy had
and put it to good use.

stinger sting~

{BO,YELLOW}Needle-like in appearance, this stinger is almost a foot
long and has a slight curve to it. Toxins can be delivered
via the hollow center. While the stinger is quite stiff to 
penetrate the victim, it still retains its flexibility.

{BO,WHITE}This impossibly fine filament seems to dance in the
breeze. While it seems incredible fragile, it possesses
surprising durability. Good thing that light reflected
off it, else you would have missed it.
