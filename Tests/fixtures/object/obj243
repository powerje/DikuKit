The guy in the picture is in a strange leather type harness.
He's on all fours and it looks like he is barking like a dog.
     You take another look at the guy and he looks very
familiar to you.. You can't quite put your finger on who it is.
OH! MY! the woman is the chick you just did in upstairs!  Boy oh
Boy!  These people really walk on the wild side.. The room in
