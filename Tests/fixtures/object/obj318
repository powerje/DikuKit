Rocks Pile~
{BO,B}
   You find it rather strange that there would be a pile of rocks baked into a loaf of bread.
   You roll them around in your hands, curious as to what signifigance they may have. It seems the more 
   you touch them, their shape changes. You rub at them roughly in anticipation, and watch them with wonder
   as you now hold in your hand, a pile of iron wrought keys of different shapes and sizes. 

   You drop the keys in disbelief. But before you can tell your companions, you watch as they quickly morph back 
   into their original shape of small, smooth stones. A mischievous grin creeps across your features as you 
   discreetly deposit the stones into your pouch for safekeeping. "These could turn out to be useful," you think to yourself.

   inhumane death-cries.  You wonder to yourself, where in heavens could
   this tunnel take you. Only one way to find out...
