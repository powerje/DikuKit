     Buzz's beloved intergalactic spaceship is laying here in a mess
of twisted cardboard and glue.  This will takes weeks to repair!

  As you take a closer look at the cape, you realize that it belongs to the
legendary mriswrith!  This cape allows the mriswrith to completely blend into
it's surroundings...maybe it will also enable you to blend.
