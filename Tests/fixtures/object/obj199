insignia BM club~
This pin is worn by those feared warriors who wander alone except for their
fierce alegance to the brotherhood of Big Men. Those who wear this pin are
the sworn enemy of every other insignifigant rag-tag association of players
who feel they have what it takes to player kill. Above all this pin is
worn by those with an undying honour to the code of the Big Men.
