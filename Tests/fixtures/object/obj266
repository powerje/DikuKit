Two new zones are opening up on NCMud!!
The first is Prom Night, a mid level non avatar place that is located north
of Midgaard. Here, one can find some pretty decent eq and some good experience
as well! Again, this area is not for avatars, and I personally recommend
non avatars group, unless they think they're strong enough.

The second is Sailor Moon, a very tough avatar place located on top of Narshe.
Some pretty decent eq can be found here as well. I recommend taking A LOT of
avatars as this place can and will leave a lot of corpses lying around.
This place is BUFF!

I hope you find these zones pretty exciting! If you have any comments about
wither one, feel free to mud mail me!

Have fun!

Wow! Here are two new zones opening up for business, I
hope you enjoy them!

Prom Night: This area is located somewhere east of Midgaard north
of Gotham, and is for levels 20-35 non avatar. Some of the mobs can
get pretty tough, so grouping may be possible.

Sailor Moon: This zone is located on top of Narshe and should only
be tried by hearty avatars. Any low levels that try to get into the
Negaverse will quickly get tosted.


Both of these areas have been brought to you by that lovely immort
NinjaEdge, please kill him if you can.

you will encounter on the mud, and 5-7 avatars may be needed for this
project. Any low levels will find themselves dead rather quickly.
