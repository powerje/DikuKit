The last time the shades invavde Midgaard, the players of NC defended thier
fair city against the plague of the shades.  They slaughtered the Shade Lord
twice. It was a valiant fight, however the forces of evil are regrouping and
will quite possibly stike again.  Some information has come to our attention.
the shades plan to attack on March 21st... around 2:00pm EST.  So make sure
you are around to defend your fair city against these horrible atrocities.

E
rules3~
3. In order to consider a player for membership into UK, s/he must be level
   15 primary.  A current member of UK must nominate the person and give a
   brief description of why this player is a good candidate for membership.
   After posting the nomination in the Communications Room, there is a two
   day waiting period in which other members of UK must _interview_ or
   _interact_ with the nominee and post whether or not they think the person
   should be membered.  If there are three or more negative postings, then
   the person will be turned down for membership and the person who
   nominated him/her must let the player know about the club's decision.
   Otherwise, anyone who is club level 8+ can member the person into UK
   after two days.  In addition, whoever members the player into UK must
   post that they did so.
~
E
rules2~
3. Members should keep personal logs of zones they've done including
   what mobs they've encountered, what eq is on which mob, and what the
   stats are for different types of eq.  In turn, members should share
   their findings with other members.  However, a level 35 player does
   not need to show a level 20 player how to do a zone that is beyond
   them.  For example, a level 20 player does not need to know how to
   go through Rifts (ok, I'm showing my age here) when a more appropriate
   zone for them to do is The X-Mansion (shameless plug :).
~
E
rules1~
1. Members must help newbies.  Remember, they are potential candidates for
   our club!  Typically, a member should be friendly and helpful when
   answering newbie questions.  A member can give newbies starter eq, but
   should not give eq away all the time.  It's better to help a newbie with
   a zone.
 
2. Members must help fellow UK club members.  Please DO NOT GIVE AWAY EQ
   simply because a member asked for it.  This applies specifically to
   limited items and any popular eq on NC at the time.  Instead, show a
   member how to do a zone.  We need individual strength as well as team
   strength.
~
E
rules4~
4. UK is a non-playerkilling (non-PK) club.  The only exceptions to this
   rule are Chaos, Challenge, and Mortal Kombat modes.  Please note that
   these exceptions are by personal choice only.  That is, you decide
   whether or not to participate.
 
5. Since UK is a peaceful club, members are not allowed to participate
   in club raids.  However, if UK is raided by another club, then
   members are allowed to defend the club by any means necessary.

Of the finest quality, this black baby grand piano shimmers in
the light of the Rec Room.  When Allen was a child of 7 years
he learned to play several musical instruments, the first of
which was this baby grand before you.  Maintained in good
condition by the CRC janitorial staff, this treasured musical
masterpiece will forever be here in honor of the wise, talented
and musically gifted, Allen, Co-Head of CRC.
