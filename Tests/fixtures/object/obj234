   To those who have traveled here,

   The city of {YELLOW}NeXis {BLACK}is at great peril, once again. You have been
   called upon to make peace between the magefolk and the mortals.
   
   I warn thee to be very alert on your journey to the city, for it is
   long and the lands in which you must travel are ridden with black
   magic.
   
   Please, do not waste any more time...so much devastation has
   already plagued my city...........

Staff High Magic Aurian~
{BOLD}{WHITE}
   A staff is a vital tool for a Mage, serving to focus and concentrate
   their power. Each of the Magefolk, on reaching a certain degree of
   aptitude, would make a staff from one of the traditional magical
   trees - from a branch or a root, as they preferred - and fuse it with
   their power and personality.

   This particular staff was carved by {CYAN}Anvar{WHITE}, for {RED}Aurian{WHITE}. He had
   carved it carefully, using the natural twists of the wood to form the
   two Serpents of the High Magic - the Serpent Might and the
   Serpent of Wisdom - that coil, intertwining, up the length of the
   staff from bottom to top. It is the most beautiful thing you have
   ever seen, with a force and life of its own.

   For example, when you look in the treasure chest:
   The treasurechest contains:
   Cat claws...(glow)
   Hammer(hum)

   the second person. And don't fret, if you don't get that last object
