Rumor has it that a group from town was to invade our secret hide-a-way and
rescue the Mayor's Aunt. In hearing this, I frantically moved our captive 
to a safe place: The Kingdom of the Zombies. I believe that is the name.
I'm not certain of the location, but if you look at your map, you can
clearly see. From there we will begin negotiations with the Mayor,
hoping we'll get more money than any of us can imagine!
Make sure you come here quickly, I'm afraid her condition is very serious
and requires your attention. If she dies, we will lose everything.
Your presence is needed quickly!
Sincerely, -StP

P.s. I will have a note for you when you get there.

   The Emperor shucked off these fine boots made
   of cyan-dyed seal hide.  The thick leather soles
   are hardly worn and show the cushy life lead by
   royalty.  The boots fasten up the front with a
   series of speed nuts and eyelets.  The soft fur
   insides invite you to sink your toes into the
   boots.  Go ahead, the Emperor won't miss them!

  Ancient tales of the bloodlust sleeves never
  quite did them justice. Eventhough the stories
  depict an object of ancient power, you never
  imagined just how strong that power would be.
  The sleeves draw you in and compel you to 
  finish what was started so long ago. Those 
  not counted as your brothers must die! They all
  must die!
