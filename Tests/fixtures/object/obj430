{W,BO}Made from the hardest metal know to man, these 
leggings have some marks on them, but they appear
to be impenetrable.  Although quite heavy, they
do not seem to interfere with movement when worn.
If you look carefully, you can see a federation
symbol in red that is worn away from a history of 
battle.{w,bo}

Gemulonian space wyverns in midflight, and our captain has
been poisoned by their bite! We have crash landed on this planet,
and need to find the ingredients for the remedy. We 
will need the poison from the fang of a smurf,
a vial of crystal clear condensed water, a herb that
originated from Degobah, and the fresh carcass of an
atlantic cod.
In addition, the essense of chaos will greatly aid in the
recovery process. Although this is not required, it would
be greatly appreciated.
These ingredients must be boiled together in order to create
the remedy which can save our captain. If anyone is able
to bring us these ingredients, they will be greatly rewarded
in the meantime, we will do our utmost to keep our captain alive.
