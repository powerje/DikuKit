It's a huge tower shield, and looks like its made entirely of psychic energy.
Not being made of matter, it is incredibly lightweight and well-balanced.

Video Cassette~
It's a copy of Northern Crossroads: The Movie.  Not well received by the critics,
it nevertheless remains a cult classic and favorite among a certain circle of
individuals who never set eyes on daylight...

Long ago, the gods created magical treasures for the mortals that praised and
pleased them.  But before these treasures could be given to the rightful
recipients, an Evil Lord stole those treasures for himself, thinking to wield
great powers.  The gods hunted this Evil Lord down and battle ensued.  The
treasures were scattered and lost all over the lands, and all manner of
creatures took them for their own.

It is rumored that the gods want these treasures returned.  There are 35 lost
items (5 sets of 7).  Only a complete set can be offered back to the gods.  It
is also rumored that a reward may be granted to the mtals that find, buy or
trade for a complete set of these items.  Only 5 complete sets will be
accepted.  In your hands you hold one of these items...

Before you stands a huge, pulsating goldn arch made of a material you have
never seen before.  Upon closer observation, you realize that this arch is, in
fact, a transporter to an unknown place.  You also notice that the
craftsmanship is of an unknown origin.  Hmm... was this arch created by aliens?
That question quickly fades into the deepest recesses of your mind when you
realize that adventure awaits on the other side... BANZAII!!
