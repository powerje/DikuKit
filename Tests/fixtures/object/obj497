  Looking at the plate that long still won't help
  you decipher what it is. She said it was a squashed
  possum, perhaps she's right. Though, it's not really 
  something you see nor eat everyday. Some say it 
  tastes like chicken.

  Once upon a time, long, long ago, this was a tree. Not just{Y}

  huge storm one night, the other trees pushed and shoved{GR}
  this giant tree until it just couldn't stand any longer{Y}
  and with a giant THUMP! the tree fell. Today, it rests{GR}
  on the forest floor overrun by moss and lichen. No one{Y}
  really remembers just how tall the tree was, but the log{GR}
  is proof enough that this tree was something special.{Y}
  Not even the strongest man in the forest can cut through{GR}
  the trunk of this tree. So, it sits blocking the path{Y}
  forever.
