statue Airagar~

   You see the figure of a man swathed in what seems to be armor
made out of the scales of a dragon.  His right hand rests on the
pommel of the Great Sword sheathed at his side.  When you look up
into the eyes of this stone monument you almost feel as though he
is actually looking at you...weighing..considering..but then you
blink and the feeling passes.  You notice a symbol carved into the
cloak the man is wearing..that of a cloaked man with an unseen
wind wrapping his cloak about him.  The symbol is well known in
these parts...it is that of the Northwinds.
