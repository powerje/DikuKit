veil dark darkness night~

     This section of the night sky shows no light at all.
     It seems to block out the flashs of lightning which
     dance and weave through the nite sky.  Even the rain
     seems to move around it instead of passing through
     as if avoiding it completely.

     An archway forming a pair of disfigured skeletons
     stands to the north.  The archways craftsmanship is
     superb.  The skeletons appear in great agony as if
     being tortured by an unseen creature.  The shadows
     reflecting off their twisted bodys makes you feel
     uneasy at the least.

     heard the word "enter" but perhaps it was your own
     imagination playing tricks on you.
