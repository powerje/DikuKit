  Water bubbles merrily in the fountain. It makes
  you so thirsty just looking at it. A lot of lose
  change is lying around in the fountain, but the
  urge to take a drink is too strong for you to
  consider the unsanitary conditions!

   |           THEM TO THE LOST AND FOUND. ALSO, BE  |
   |           FOREWARNED ABOUT ENTERING ANY EMPTY   |
   |           STORES. THEY ARE BEING RENOVATED.     |
