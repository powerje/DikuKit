Ironbane sword flamberge~
{Y}
   This magical relic comes from lands unknown, forged
   by some ancient race with magical prowess never 
   before seen in this world.  The large double-handed
   flamberge has a jagged, double-edged blade... Elegant
   runes are carved along the blood groove.
 
   This weapon is incredibly light for its size, and can 
   cut through the toughest armor as if it was butter!
