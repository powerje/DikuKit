  He is took over the task of rebuilding <B> short-
  ly after his escape from Pescadero Mental Institu
  tion, where he shared a maximum security cell wi-
  th other 'creators' of NC. The magnanimous father
  of Club B, Lord Byron, took pity on him and let
  this unlikely leader to try and bring B ack to li
  fe once more. That his efforts were a success  is
  arguable.

  As you gaze up  at his statue  in awe, your heart
  is filled with pride in remembering who he is and
  what he stands for. You also notice the statue is
  grossly caked in bird poop.

  grace its branches. Presents of all shapes and

  different B members' names on them. You wonder
  if there is a present for you somewhere under

flyer paper new~
Ok the maze has been completed. I changed the maze completly and
made sure everything is legel. It will probably be reviewed in
the next week or so.
I also modified the club rooms a bit. This simplifies the club
some and also helps us protect VS raiders. The general board, 
fridge and maze are all still N. Exits out of club are now in
the main room. There is also a door s in main room so u can 
close it when we are being raided. This will cause a raider to
either flee out of club or north when we are attacked in main 
room much greater chance to flee out. S is don, and everything
else in club. It is not a huge change but I believe it is in
the best interest of the club. 
Let me know if u Like or dislike changes. Did I forget 
anything??? Please explore and tell me what ya think.

      are to {CYAN,BOLD}all of us{g} in this game.

      magically, turned itself into more than just people
      playing together. {CYAN,BOLD}We are a family.{g} We watch
      out for each other, we care for each other, and there's not
      a single thing we wouldn't do for each other.
   
      The point of this is to remind you that you are {CYAN,BOLD}never alone{g}.
      We are always here. We love you. We want you happy. And
      it is a goal that has become very dear to my heart. You
      have become one of my {CYAN,BOLD}best friends{g}. And we'll
      always be here when you most need us.
