tips~
Some tips to remember when creating mobs are:
1) Be creative in your ldescs.
Instead of: A man is standing here. 
2) Use names that correspond to something in the ldesc.
3) Use of colors is nice, but keep it in control.
4) For descriptions, be detailed and creative.  However, in the case 
of aggressive mobs, keep in mind that characters will not be looking 
at the mobs since they will be in the middle of fighting.
5) In cases where it is necessary, use other mobs stats as an 
example for your mob (with permission from higher ups).
if you can stat a zombie to see what type of hps and damage it has.
6) When determining damage for a mob, keep in mind that characters 
have the sanctuary spell, which halves all damage.  Also keep in 
mind the number of attacks your mob will have.
See {BO}Tips2{bo} for more tips.

This is the primary and secondary class that the mob has. (M=mage, 
nothing or one or two classes.  (e.g. 'medit class bt' would be a 
blademaster/thief while 'medit class b' would just be a blademaster)  
The class determines which skills the creature can use.
~
E
tips2~
7) Keep in mind how many of these creatures will be in a room when 
determining difficulty and damage.
8) Make sure that you put some of the basic spells on mobs unless 
you have a reason to not include them.  These include: infravision, 
detect-invisible, sense-life, immune_summon amongst others.
9) For experience calculation, the computer determines that amount 
of experience that is given by a mob by using its damage, 
spell_affects, hitpoints and other factors.  See {BO}experience{bo} 
for more explanation on experience calculation.

X is the amount of hitpoints you want the creature to have.

group of 5 50th level advanced characters kill a creature.  Their 
max experience is 7M.  If the computer determines the experience for 
the mob to be 15M, this 15M will be split by the group of 5, thus 
each character getting 3M.  If you set the experience to be 10M.  
Now there is 25M that can be split within this group.  Now each 
character will get 5M.)
