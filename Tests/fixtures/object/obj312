oak golden leaf~
   The leaf is made of very thin gold plating. At first you think
it has been crafted by a goldsmith, but after carefully examining
you realize it is leaf that has fallen from the tree of knowledge.

Some sort of magical barrier has been erected here, blocking the way
eastwards. Someone either doesn't want anyone to enter Garamond, or
anyone to leave. A powerful someone.

rotting corpse~
   The clothing on the corpse seems to resemble the livery of the
Garamond Council of Archmages. The shape of the body leads you to
the conclusion that whoever it was, they were a halfing. The wound that
put an end to the halfling's life is a deep gapping hole surrounded by charred
flesh. It would be impossible to identify the body any further, since the eyes, nose,
and lips have been eaten by maggots.

orders order~
   You've been chosen for this assignment because you're the
best we have. Your target's death is our number one priority, he's
the only one left who can stand in our way. If the Council of Druids
gets a hold of the power he possesses there could be a major shift in
the balance of power. If the Queen makes contact with him it could mean
the end for all of us. Use the method we spoke about earlier to enter his
dwelling beneath the well and put an end to our problems.
