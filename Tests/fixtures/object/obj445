{B} {b}{B} {b}{B} {b}{WHI,BOL}The book of Nosgoths history:

{B} {b}{B} {b}{B} {b}{BLA,BOL}The realm of Nosgoth is an ancient battleground for which two
{B} {b}{B} {b}{B} {b}{BLA,BOL}god-like species have been at war since before history. Firstly
{B} {b}{B} {b}{B} {b}{BLA,BOL}the Vampires, and secondly the Hylden, with a third faction in
{B} {b}{B} {b}{B} {b}{BLA,BOL}the form of the Elder God. The Hylden in earlier times waged an
{B} {b}{B} {b}{B} {b}{BLA,BOL}all out war, but in modern times, fight through surrogates and
{B} {b}{B} {b}{B} {b}{BLA,BOL}pawns. The level of sophistication their warfare has developed
{B} {b}{B} {b}{B} {b}{BLA,BOL}is staggering, and much more realistic for such a protracted
{B} {b}{B} {b}{B} {b}{BLA,BOL}battle than the wasteful, exhaustive and ultimately short-term
{B} {b}{B} {b}{B} {b}{BLA,BOL}warfare style originally endorsed by both species.

{B} {b}{B} {b}{B} {b}{BLA,BOL}In ancient times, the Hylden had attempted to put a decisive end
{B} {b}{B} {b}{B} {b}{BLA,BOL}to the war by developing a super-weapon which would extinguish
{B} {b}{B} {b}{B} {b}{BLA,BOL}the life of the world. This weapon, apparently, violated a number
{B} {b}{B} {b}{B} {b}{BLA,BOL}of the fundamental laws governing the nature of the world and
{B} {b}{B} {b}{B} {b}{BLA,BOL}reality, severely upsetting the balance of life and death, which
{B} {b}{B} {b}{B} {b}{BLA,BOL}the Ancient Vampires held to be sacred. The Pillars of Nosgoth
{B} {b}{B} {b}{B} {b}{BLA,BOL}were erected in order to restore balance and order to the land,
{B} {b}{B} {b}{B} {b}{BLA,BOL}and ensure that these governing dynamics were never bent or broken
{B} {b}{B} {b}{B} {b}{BLA,BOL}again. Furthermore, the Vampires enacted a massive exile, banishing
{B} {b}{B} {b}{B} {b}{BLA,BOL}the Hylden race from the world of Nosgoth. Each pillar of the nine
{B} {b}{B} {b}{B} {b}{BLA,BOL}pillars represents one of the nine orders which the Ancient Vampires
{B} {b}{B} {b}{B} {b}{BLA,BOL}divined were the governing forces of the world, and each pillar had
{B} {b}{B} {b}{B} {b}{BLA,BOL}a Guardian whose task was to protect and uphold his respective laws.

{B} {b}{B} {b}{B} {b}{BLA,BOL}However, their power is waning and some seek to destroy the pillars
{B} {b}{B} {b}{B} {b}{BLA,BOL}entirely. It is unknown whether there was ever a time of peace in 
{B} {b}{B} {b}{B} {b}{BLA,BOL}Nosgoth or whether one will ever come to pass. The Pillars served
{B} {b}{B} {b}{B} {b}{BLA,BOL}a dual purpose: along with preserving the balance of the land, the
{B} {b}{B} {b}{B} {b}{BLA,BOL}Pillars acted as a gateway, banishing the Hylden into a desolate
{B} {b}{B} {b}{B} {b}{BLA,BOL}dimension, inhabited by numerous monsters. The Pillars also act as
{B} {b}{B} {b}{B} {b}{BLA,BOL}the lock to this gate, and as long as they stand the Hylden are
{B} {b}{B} {b}{B} {b}{BLA,BOL}trapped, but for as the Pillars weaken they are able to manifest
{B} {b}{B} {b}{B} {b}{BLA,BOL}using the bodies of the dead.{bla,bol}
