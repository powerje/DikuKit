tree pine majestic~

   You see one of the most magnificent pine trees you've ever
   seen in your entire life!  This thing looks like it would
   make the absolute perfect Christmas tree and you wish you
   were tall enough decorate it.  From within it's limbs, you
   hear several happy little birdies chirping and cooing.  Oh
   what a lovely place this is.  It looks like a good place to
   relax for awhile.

 tarantula Mexican red-knee~

   Siete, one of Wysi's most highly prized specimens has escaped
   the confines of his little home.  Apparently, he's been on the
   prowl for quite some time and seems to be a little on the thin
   side.  Maybe you should  get him back to Wysi as soon as
   possible!  Rumor has it that Wysi has put out a reward for his
   return!  Careful, he's a wiggly little guy.  You should
   probably put him into a container so he doesn't get away!
