flask~

   The flask is glowing and has elements in it that make it seem hard to
carry. The flask is made out of a a strange glass and has designs all 
around it sides. It must be directions of some sort on how to activate the
chemicals inside it.

~
E
flask~

  A mixture of chemicals know only to High Level Theives fills this flask.
The swirling metal flakes in the liquid seem the shimmer in the sunlight.
The weight of it makes it very dense therefore heavy to carry. Designs are
etched on the outside of the flask, probably directions on how us activate
the contents.

It looks and feels more like a peice of cloth then a peice of paper. The
writting on it is strange but you can figure it out. It is pretty worn
and tattered and should be handled with the alot of care....

 Yes it was I who stole the Kings scepter. It was to powerful for one man

has a clue to its wear abouts....
