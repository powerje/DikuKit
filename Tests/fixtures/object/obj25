flyer quest~
   There will be a major battle tonight, pitting
any willing mortals against one another and against
creatures especially created for the occasion.
In the end, one mortal will be rewarded for outlasting
all others in the arena and receive a special piece
of equipment.
   I'm sure you're all wondering how tough the mobs
are, how good the eq is, and how long it's timered
for.  Show up around 9:30 EST, and join in the
battle.  Corpses will be returned, but chaos will
be active for the quest, so bring your bloodthirst.
