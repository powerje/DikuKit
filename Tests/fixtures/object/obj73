                  30 Grouping with other Players
 
  One of the most enjoyable things here is grouping. This is when you
and other players band together to fight or explore. When you are low
level, it is best to group with others so that you will not be killed as
easily.  You can only group with people who are NO MORE or NO LESS then 15
levels above or below you. Once you are part of a group, you will gain
experience as you kill Mobs.  The experience you gain will be less then
if you killed the Mob yourself, but your chances of dying are less and you
can kill harder mobs. Try to form a group with all four classes. To find a
group to join use the gossip channel. You simply type: gossip Does anyone
want to GROUP?????? Some players should respond to this request.  If no one
does then try again later.

                        29 ALIAS
 
  An alias is a way to replace a long command into a word or letters.
For example, you can make an Alias to make you drink out of your barrel.
Type: alias com dr drink barrel. Now when you type dr you will automatically drink from your barrel.  Type Help Alias.

                        28 RECALLING
 
  During battle or when you want to return to the temple in town you can
use a scroll of recall.  Buy scrolls at the magic shop in town. To use it
type RECITE SCROLL.  This will automatically transfer you back to town.
This is useful if you are lost or if you need to escape during a battle.
Remember that you must have the scroll in your inventory in order to use it.
You can not use it if it's in a container or a bag of some sort. You DO NOT
need to first hold the scroll to use it.

                     27 Renting and Quitting
 
  If you want to stop playing, you need to go to the Hotel (in town) and
rent.  It will cost you a certain amount of gold to save your eq. When you
get to the hotel you first type: OFFER to see how much it will cost you to
rent.  Then type: RENT to save your character and eq.  If you do not have
enough gold to rent, GOSSIP and ask for help, someone will help you with rent.
You can also stop playing by typing Quit.  If you do this you will loose all
your equipment SO be careful when you use this command.

                        23 Healing

yourself.  You can go to the HEALER to buy potions to use in combat.
In order to use these potions just type: quaff (potion name).

                     22 BAGS and CONTAINERS
  
  You will need to keep things you are carrying in bags or containers.
You can buy a bag from the general store in town.  You will also find
different types of containers in your adventures.  Different types of
containers will allow you to put different amounts of things in them.
In order to put something into a bag type: PUT (item name) BAG.  To take
something out type: GET (item name) BAG. If you are carrying multiple bags
you need to specify which bag number you wish to put the item in.  Type: 
PUT (item name) (number of bag).For example, type: PUT sword 2.bag.  In
order to get something from a bag type: GET sword 2.bag

~

can buy a barrel at the Bar by the Hotel in town. After you buy a barrel, 
type: POUR BARREL OUT.  This will empty the barrel then go to a fountain and 
type FILL BARREL FOUNTAIN.  When you are thirsty type: DRINK BARREL, and when 
you are hungry type: EAT (food name).

                     20 Invisibility
 
  There are many things on NC which are invisible. Equipment, objects, and
even some Players.  You will not be able to see these things if you don't
have some sort of detect invisibility spell, potion, or object. The simplest
way to see invisible objects and people is to go to the Magic Shop in town and
buy a Yellow Potion.  This will allow you to see invisible things for a
certain amount of time. If you are invisible and you try to buy something at
the shops, the shop keepers will not do business with you.

~
E
19~
 
                 19 EQUIPMENT REPAIR 
 
  You need to regularly repair your eq.. If you don't it will disappear
after heavy use. To repair your eq, go to the smithy and type repair all. DO 
THIS OFTEN!!! Remember it costs money to fix your stuff so have money ready 
before you repair.

~
E
18~
 
                     18 EQUIPMENT
 
  A full inventory of eq. consists of 18 items worn, held, or wielded.
Good equipment is a vital part of the game.  Some eq. will improve your
armor class, mana, movement, or hit points. Most pieces give some type of 
affect.  To find out what a piece of eq. does, use a scroll of identify on it. 
Some eq. is aligned, you must be evil, neutral, or good to wear or use it.  
Your alignment changes as you kill certain types of monsters (or MOBS).  If 
you kill good mobs you will become evil, if you kill evil mobs you will become 
good.

                       17a ADVANCED CLASSES  
 
    ADVANCED classes are determined by your first class except for AVATAR.
      
      AVATAR - has almost all skills of all 4 basic classes.
      ARCHMAGE - mage as first class
      ASSASSIN - thief as first class
      BLADEMASTER - warrior as first class
      DRUID - cleric as first class

~
E
15~
 
                   15  EXAMINE CORPSES
 
  After you kill a mob, you will want to look to see what the mob is
carrying. To do this, type: EXAMINE CORPSE (exa corpse).  This will show
you all eq the corpse has. To take something from the corpse you type:
GET (item) CORPSE.  You can also type: GET ALL CORPSE to take everyting.
If you want to drop something you took, type: DROP (item name). If there is
more then one corpse in the room type: Examine (corpse number).
Example:  Exa 2.corpse.  To take an item type: Get (item) corpse number.
This is the same concept as getting things from multiple bags in your inv.

14~
 
                       14 DEATH TRAPS
 
  In your many explorations you will probably run into a DEATH TRAP.
When you hit a DT you will DIE and LOOSE ALL YOUR EQ.  There will be NO
reimbursements for lost eq in a DT. Most of the DT's will kill you
instantly, but some will allow you to fly over them thus avoiding death. 
You must be wearing eq which allows you to fly or have a fly spell cast on 
you. One way you can detect DT's is by using a thief's PEEK ability.  Simply 
peek to the direction you wish to go. Peek more than once in case you fail!!
THIS IS A GOOD REASON TO GROUP.  Remember when you are in a new area, peek 
first before entering into a room.

                         12 Wimpy
 
  A good idea is to set your Wimpy.  Wimpy will automatically make you
flee in battle when you reach a certain hit point.  For example, if you
have 20 hit points total and you want to flee from you opponent when you
reach 10 hit points you would type :  WIMPY 10.  Remember that when you
flee from an opponent after you are engaged in a battle, you will loose 
some experience points.

~

                       11 Fleeing
 
  When you are in combat and you want to stop fighting, you can type:
FLEE to run away from your enemy.  Fleeing may not always work so
remember to type flee early (before you loose all your hit points).
You will lose some experience when you flee but it will be less than if 
you die.
 
  In case you are not able to flee, you may (if you are fast enough) try
to use a Scroll of Recall (which you can purchase at the magic shop).  You
do not have to hold the Scroll of Recall in order to use it.  You do need to 
have it in your inventory (not in a container or bag). Some mobs will be able 
to destroy your scroll in battle so be careful. type: RECITE RECALL

~

                  10 Skills
    
  Type: Help Skills.  This lists all the skills available to Warriors and
Thieves and at what level you will be able to learn that skill. Once you
learn a skill you use it by typing: (Skill name) (Mob name). For example,
a thief would type: BACKSTAB Doggie.  Skills are learned at your class
guild. Refer to the upper map of Midgaard for the location of your guild.
Keep your Intelligence high when you practice your skills to cut down on
the number of practices needed to learn a new skill.  You will need Practice
sessions to practice your skills, these are earned when you level.

                       05  Communicating
 
  There are several ways to communicate with others.  The simplest
way is to type: say (your message) or you can use (') in place of
the word say.
   
     SAY - the person must be in the same room
     TELL - tell to a person anywhere on the mud
     SHOUT - heard by all, use sparingly.
     GOSSIP or gos - general communication mud wide to everyone.

NOT show secret or hidden exits.
  
  There are many SECRET EXITS and HIDDEN DOORS.  Often something good

                        13  DYING!!!
 
  On your many adventures to come, you will SURELY die while doing battle.
Don't worry, death is part of life. When you die you re-enter the game.
Once you do.  The first think you must do is GO GET YOUR STUFF BACK!!!. Most
likely you will not be able to do it without the help of a high level player.
So ASK someone to HELP you.!!!!
 
This is important because YOUR Equipment is YOUR LIFE!!!!, DONT LOOSE IT.

                     16 SPELLS
 
  Mage and Cleric's will have the ability to cast spells. Casting spells
will cost you mana (the amount of mana depends on the spell).  To find out 
what spells you have type: PRACTICE or (pra).  To see a list of the spells 
available type: SPELLS.  To get a description on a certain spell, type: Help 
(spell name). You must go to your guild to train your spells. To use your 
spells type: Cast '(spell name)' (mob's name) or cast '(spell name)' mob
to cast the spell on the first mob (creature) in the room.  Be careful when 
you use this because you can accidently cast a spell on a mob that will 
Destroy you. Also, if a mob happens to wander into the room and you press 
return, you will cast the spell on that mob.
 
  Example :  Cast 'chill touch' doggie  (always include ' when casting)
             Cast 'cure light' (self)
~
E
17~
 
                            17 LEVELING
 
 You advance in level by gaining experience.  You gain experience by killing
mobs.  When you start your character you chose a class.  This is a dual class
mud.  At level 15 you are allowed to chose a 2nd class. To do this you will
go to Paladins Temple and Pray for your 2nd class.  Any higher level player
can show you where to go. At level 50/50 dual you again go to the Temple and
pray for an ADVANCED CLASS.  The highest level you can be as a mortal is
50 ADVANCED (Archmage, Assassin, Avatar, Blademaster, Druid). Remember to 
keep your CON and WIS as high as possible when you level, this will gain you
the maximum hitpoints and practices. Increased stats are important to ADVANCED 
classes but you must discover which ones. Duals level at Bozo up from Market
Square.  Avatars advance automatically, other ADVANCED must go to their 
trainer to advance.  These trainers are hidden and must be found.
 
~
E
24~
 
                     24 Resting & Sleeping
 
  Another way you can regenerate your Hit points is to rest or sleep
after battles.  This will also regenerate your mana and movement
points. As you run out of mana, hit points, or movement type REST or
SLEEP and your points will regenerate. You will have faster regeneration
if you are resting in the Mallins. The Mallins is located under Market
Square.  If the door to the Mallins is closed just type: OPEN Mausoleum.

~
E
25~
 
                    25 ENERGY and MOVEMENT
 
  Sometimes your energy level and movement will run out.  This may happen
because you have walked too much or if you are wearing a piece of eq which
drains all your energy or if one of your spells runs out.  If this happens
you can do one of two things.  1) REST, Sleep until your energy returns or
2) Eat something.  This should reset all your movement back to maximum.

~
E
26~
 
                       26 SAVING
 
  Occasionally, the mud has crashes.  Remember to type SAVE often.
You should type save after every kill or if you get a piece of new
eq. Get use to typing save, in case of a crash.  If the we have a
crash and you did not type save you will not get your experience
points or eq. reimbursed.  The mud will automatically save your game
every 2 minutes or so BUT don't take that chance.

~
E
31~
 
                       31 Alignment
 
  As you kill different types of mobs, your alignment will change.
If you kill Good mobs (like cityguards) you will become more and
more evil.  As you kill evil mobs (like fidos) you will become more and
more good.  To check your alignment type SCORE. Many types of equipment
require that you have a certain alignment to wear them.  You will need to
kill the proper types of mobs to change your alignment.  If a piece of eq.
"zaps" you, then your alignment is wrong.

~
E
32~
 
                   32 MESSAGE BOARDS
 
  There are several message boards located around the city.  This is where
important messages are posted.  These messages may be about anything from
rules to problems.  There is a message board directly north of the Temple
Square. Remember to check these boards on a regular basis.  You may post on
these boards anytime you have a comment or question.

~
E
33~
 
                      33 MAIL
 
  You can write to other people who are NOT on the game by going
to the post office.  The post office is located in the city (refer to map).
You can write a message to someone or receive mail if someone has written
you a message.  This can be very useful if you need to relay a message to
another player who is not currently on. When you log onto the game you will
see a message on your screen telling you if you have mail or not.

~
E
34~
 
                    34 DONATIONS & SACRIFICING
 
  There is a Donation room located in town where players can donate
equipment for others.  Please refer to the map for location. As you get
more equipment through your many adventures, you can donate some of your
stuff to others. To do this you type: Don (item).  This will automatically 
donate the item directly to the donation room.  You do not have to Be in the 
Donation room to donate.  Please Don't fill the donation room with Useless 
items. If you want to get rid of an item PERMANENTLY you can sacrifice it to 
the Gods.  Any item you sacrifice will be GONE!! So be careful when you do 
this. You can sacrifice an item by typing:  Sac (item)
~
E
35~
 
                    35 IMMORTALS AND GODS
 
  Immortals and Gods are higher level beings who help run the mud.
These people were once players like yourself, but have advanced in
levels and experience to become Immortal. Type: who -lfc. This will
show you which immortals are on.  They are the ones with the [   ] next
to their names.   For example [Immortal] or [God]. Type: wizlist.
This will show you a list of all the immortals on the mud. These people
are here to help players with questions and problems. Feel free to ask
anyone of them for help.  Immortal levels are Immortal through Committee.
Committee are the actual coders of the mud.  You too can become an Immortal
someday if you have a desire to work hard and create an area of your own.

                           36 CLUBS!!!
 
  There are several types of clubs here on Northern Crossroads.  Most people
can join a club depending on their levels and skills. Type: CLUBS and you
will get a list of things you can do.  For example, type: CLUBS LIST to get
a list of the clubs here on the MUD.  In addition, you can type: HELP CLUBS
to find out more about clubs.  Clubs are cool because most club houses have
very helpful things in them. A lot of clubs have certain requirements for
people to join.  You can ask any club member what those requirements are.
To see which players are in which club type: Who -lcf.  It is a good idea to
wait a while before joining a club to see exactly which club you will fit
into.  Changing clubs after you have joined one is not always easy.

                 37 CONGRATULATIONS
 
   You have completed the NEWBIE HANDBOOK.  It is full of wise and
useful information.  We would like to suggest that you hold this book
for a while as it will increase your wisdom and intelligence.  Refer
to it often when you have a question about NC.
                                        THANK YOU FOR VISITING US!!

18a~
 
          18a  MINIMUM LEVEL EQUIPMENT
 
Effective 7/24/97 NC will have equipment that will require a minimum 
level for a player to be able to wear it.  This will be applied mostly
to Advanced equipment but can apply to all equipment eventually as
changes are made to exsisting equipment.
 
WHAT THIS MEANS TO YOU is that old exsisting equipment will not have 
this minimum level.  But, if there is a time when you receive a corpse
reimbursement, any equipment that was changed to minimum level will have
the new flag on it and you might not be able to wear the new equipment
until you gain a higher level.  This also means that high level equipment
without the advanced flag will no longer be able to be worn by low level
or dual class players.

3)  Players may have no more than two equipped mortals at any time. If you
    have more than two equipped mortals, we may warn, purge or delete one
    at our discretion.  Note: We will delete one at random so its better
    not to take the risk. Multi play is allowed.
 
4)  Please notify the COMM about any bugs you find.  Players caught taking
    advantage of bugs will be punished appropriately.
 
5)  PK Killing is permitted in only limited circumstances. Consult help PK
    for further details.

6)  Casting detrimental spells on other players (guinness, dispel magic, 
    etc.) or offensive magic is considered PK Killing.  Consult help PK
    for further information.
  
7)  Players may not interfere with another player's corpse. This includes
    hiding it, summoning fidos to rip it apart, summoning street cleaners
    to carry it off, or summoning saccing mobs to empty it. Players caught
    doing this will be punished as if they had looted the corpse themselves.
  
8)  As a favor to our newbies, we ask that you do not summon any aggressive
    mobs into Midgaard. Aggressive monsters are often too powerful for
    newbies and kill them with a single hit.
 
9)  The quests on Northern Crossroads are designed for one player to 
    complete unless otherwise noted. Please do not help other players with
    single player quests.

10) Please show the proper respect for our GOD+ immortals. They have
    obtained there positions through hard work and dedication and should be
    granted the respect they are due.
 
11) All COMM decisions are final.  Unless we don't want them to be.
 
12) Note players who attempt to interpret these rules by the letter rather
    than by the spirit of them, will be frowned at.

A Marble Statue of Laya, "Queen of Poets"~


Before you stands a spectacular statue, unlike any you have ever seen.
Made of marble, inlaid with gold and silver, and sculpted to fine detail.
You notice a inscription which reads:

'Gaze upon her all you want'
'Her smile so sweet, her eyes so bright'
'Your dreams her beauty will always haunt'
'You'll see her as you sleep at night'
