sign redferne warning~
This is the Castle Redferne.  Within this castle there is
a shrine to the Greater God, Naris.  Naris is a powerful
being and has enveloped this, his sacred land with a magical
aura which seemed to seep into everything.  The king is highly
devoted and gives SACRIFICES daily to his god, so beware.  
Crossing this man's path may cost more than your life.
 
The courtyard is full of beautiful flowers for the young to
destroy, but be wary of the castle, it contains much danger to
the weak.
 
Sincerely,
Jazz

This is the Castle Redferne.  It contains many different parts to it.
The main courtyard is used for experience for low to mid-level duals.
The first floor should be mid to high-level duals, while the second
floor is for groups of mid to high-level duals.  All of the equipment
is tough to get so beware and bring friends.  Beware of the
FOUNTAIN for the low-level characters.
P.S.  AVATARS NOT INVITED!!
