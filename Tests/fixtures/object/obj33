{R}  Sanguine is a Daedric Prince whose sphere is hedonistic
{R}  revelry, debauchery, and passionate indulgences of darker
{R}  natures. Fittingly, he often appears on the seals and signs
{R}  of brothels and whorehouses. Sanguine is depicted as a
{R}  portly man with a dremora-like head with horns, always with
{R}  a bottle in his hand or a whore under his thumb. He is
{R}  thought to control thousands of realms. He is known to be
{R}  allied with Vaermina, while his enemies are Ebonarm and the
{R}  Benevolence of Mara. His summoning day is Heart's Day.{b}

{BLA,BO}  Nocturnal is the Daedric Prince of darkness, luck, and the
{BLA,BO}  night. In Skyrim, her shrine lies in the Inner Sanctum of
{C}  the Twilight Sepulcher, where a portal to her realm from
{BLA,BO}  which luck seeps through is kept open by the Skeleton Key.
{BLA,BO}  Her influence lends subtle but vital luck, and for this
{C}  reason, the Nightingales formed within the Guild to protect
{BLA}  Nocturnal's shrine and ensure obedience to her will. In
{BLA}  exchange for protecting her shrine in both life and death,
{C}  Nocturnal tips the odds to their favor.{b}

{Y,BO}  Peryite, the Taskmaster, is the Daedric Prince whose
{Y,BO}  spheres are pestilence and order. Although typically
{Y,BO}  depicted as a four-legged dragon, he is considered one of
{Y,BO}  the weakest Daedric Princes, responsible for the lowest
{Y,BO}  orders of Oblivion. He has been known to appear as
{Y,BO}  ghostly apparitions of vermin, such as skeevers. He
{Y,BO}  appears to take pleasure in "blessing" his worshipers with
{Y,BO}  diseases, and is considered one of the more maliciously
{Y,BO}  destructive Princes. Peryite's enemies are Ebonarm,
{Y,BO}  Vaermina, and Mephala. His summoning day is the Ninth of
{Y,BO}  Rain's Hand. Peryite's plane of Oblivion is known as The
{Y,BO}  Pits. It consists of the lowest reaches of Oblivion,
{Y,BO}  resembling a fiery and gloomy hell similar to the Deadlands.{b}

{R,BO}  Mehrunes Dagon is the Daedric Prince of Destruction, Change,
{WH,BO}  Revolution, Energy, and Ambition. He is associated with
{BLA,BO}  natural dangers like fire, earthquakes, and floods. He is an
{R,BO}  especially important deity in Morrowind, where he represents
{WH,BO}  its near-inhospitable terrain as one of the Four Corners of
{BLA,BO}  the House of Troubles. In most cultures, though, Dagon is
{R,BO}  merely a god of bloodshed and betrayal. Dagon's plane of
{WH,BO}  Oblivion is known as the Deadlands. As the name suggests,
{BLA,BO}  they are barren wastelands, consisting of blackened isles in
{R,BO}  a sea of lava. The Dremora, Clannfear and Scamps are among
{WH,BO}  his servants.{b}

{WH,BO}  Hircine is the Daedric Prince whose sphere is the Hunt, the
{WH,BO}  Sport of Daedra, the Great Game, the Chase, and is known as
{WH,BO}  the Huntsman and the Father of Manbeasts. Hircine created
{WH,BO}  the various therianthropic diseases which transform mortals
{WH,BO}  into beasts, and is therefore the guardian of were
{G,BO}  creatures. They reflect his sphere admirably, hunting at
{G,BO}  night and being hunted by day. Hircine's existence appears
{G,BO}  to have been discovered later than other Daedric Princes, as
{WH,BO}  he doesn't appear in the most ancient records and summonings
{WH,BO}  of him were rare or non-existent. Hircine is a sportsman who
{WH,BO}  enjoys giving his prey a chance for victory, however small.
{WH,BO}  He is typically portrayed with a great spear and either the
{WH,BO}  head or skull of a deer. Hircine's enemy is Ebonarm and his
{WH,BO}  summoning day is 5th of Mid Year.{b}

{Y}  Hermaeus Mora is the Daedric Prince whose sphere is the
{R}  scrying of the tides of Fate, of the past and future as read
{BLA,BO}  in the stars and heavens, and in whose dominion are the
{b}{Y}  treasures of knowledge and memory. He is vaguely related to
{R}  the cult origins of the Morag Tong if only by association
{BLA,BO}  with his sibling, Mephala. Unlike most Princes, Hermaeus
{b}{Y}  Mora does not take on a humanoid form at all, manifesting
{R}  instead as grotesque assemblages of eyes, tentacles, and
{BLA,BO}  claws, or a featureless purple vortex known as the Wretched

{WH,BO}  of selective shapeshifting, the form it assumes most of the
{BLA,BO}  time is that of a dog. Clavicus himself is depicted as a
{WH,BO}  small jovial fellow with horns protruding from his forehead.
{BLA,BO}  He is aptly described as a Daedra who likes souls for the

{b}{C}  Sotha Sil. Azura is one of the few Daedra who maintains the
{C,BO}  appearance of being "good" by mortal standards, and
{WH,BO}  presumably feels more concern for the well-being of her
{C,BO}  mortal subjects than other Daedric Princes. She is one of
{b}{C}  the few Daedric Princes who constantly maintains a female

{BLA,BO}  and unlawful overthrow of authority. Boethiah is also known
{BLA,BO}  as the Prince of Plots, Deceiver of Nations, Queen of

{BLA,BO}  competition and battle, and is depicted as a great caped
{BLA,BO}  warrior, often in a stoic pose. Though typically depicted as
{BLA,BO}  male, Boethiah is occasionally referred to as female,
{BLA,BO}  though such distinctions are irrelevant among the Daedric
{BLA,BO}  princes, since they have no gender.{b}
