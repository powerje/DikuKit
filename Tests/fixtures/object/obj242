   {RE}You are now looking for the "Danag" a Filipino vampire held to be very ancient
   as a species, responsible for having planted taro on the islands long ago. The
   Danag worked with humans for many years but the partnership ended one day when
   a woman cut her finger and a Danag sucked her wound, enjoying the taste so much
   that it drained her body completely of blood. This beast is rumored to be in
   hiding working the fields alongside commoners on an island in the north pacific.
   Look for it there for your next clue. It will be written upon the pulp.{re}
