  extremely sharp and it is foaming at the mouth.{bo,WH}

  {R,BO}A comet is a collection of dust particles, gases and physical rock
  which travels through a solar system on a certain course, determined
  by gravity wells of the systems star and planets.  They only glow with
  a tail when approaching the star.  This is because the heat of the star
  causes the comet to melt, leaving a trail, which is why the trail
  always faces away from the star itself.  Truly a mystery of nature.{r,bo}

  {BLACK}This tree is unbelievably HUGE with branches that extend beyond your view.
  The bark of this tree is black as night and the leaves are a dark, unhealthy
  green color and seem to ooze some kind of strange liquid.  Although you can
  see now apparently mouth or eyes, or even a means of movement, it seems it
  can move just enough to completely block the path.  The Oak's large branches
  look like huge, solid wooden fists that could pummel even a giant into a 
  bloody mess.{bo,WH}
