A large shadow dragon rears defiantly, seeking your death!
~
This great beast is many times larger than you, with black scales that seem
to pulsate with life. Its fangs equal the length of your sword, while its
fetid breath seems to corrode your strength...

A dirty orc with a crude {RED}s{MAGENTA}h{RED}o{MAGENTA}v{RED}e{MAGENTA}l{magenta} is hard at work here.
~
This little beast has a toothless grin and stinks of feces. You almost
laugh at his sorry expression, but feel pity at his existance. He blocks
your path though, so he must die...

A huge {GREEN}orc{green} is here watching over the tunnlers "safety."
~
This large fellow could crush a normal orc. His breath is prutid and bits
of his rotted teeth seem to slide off his gums. You turn to wretch as he
picks his nose and smears it on his tongue. This "thing" deserves death.

A {YELLOW}Rotund Bartender{yellow}~
The rotund bartender is sitting here, eating some greasy varmit chops.
~
This balding old man is definately overweight, and you can't help but cringe
as he pushes food into his mouth nonstop. His clothes are grease stained and
a tankard of ale seems permanently fixed to his left hand. Still, there is
a dangerously quality about him. I'd recommend leaving him alone...

This "thing" seems to be made out of wood. Long dead and very cracked, it
makes a noise with the slightest movement. Its eyes are of water, of the

defend these gates to the death...

This being is made of shadow, a dark substance that seems in painful
turmoil. Voices come from within, along with words of the past, horror and

 and bears his pain as a sign of strength. Someday
 he will return...

 A very large man, muscular but not overweight.
 He has very straight black hair and sad blue
 eyes. A calm manner makes him seem a friend
 at first glance and you find out that he is
 kind from his words as well. A dark green 
 cloak wraps about him loosely while he grasps
 a wooden figurine. You believe it to be a 
 falcon, but cant be sure.
