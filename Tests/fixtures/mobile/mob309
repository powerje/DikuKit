{W}An elderly {R}man{W} is here experimenting with the {Y}protective {BO}{C}bubble{bo}{W} around the {BO}{G}city{g}.
~

   This great wizard studied in the finest universities of the
   realm of the crossroads.  He has become so smart that no one
   is able to understand him anymore.  He makes his living here
   selling potions to students of magic and the arts of war and
   dark practices.

healer neosporin~
{R}The Great {W}Healer{R}, {bo}{W}Neosporin{w}~
{BO}{B}A great druid healer is in a meditative state practicing the art of {Y}flesh{B} fusion.{b}
~

   The origin of the great medicated ointment called "Neosporin" came
   from this druidic healer.  He was the first alchemist to inject the
   ambrosia weed with neosporin giving it its healing qualities.  Rumor
   has it that if an ambrosia was injected with a hyper-shot of this
   mythical medicine, its healing properties would be unimaginable.

{BO}{G}A large man is here discussing the politics of the day.{g}
~
 
   A jolly man with a 53 inch waist is here talking about poltics.  He
   seems to be a very knowledgeable man who spouts off long speeches about
   clubs.  Many of his common sayings are that {BO}{BLU}({G}UK{BLU}){blu} is the oldest club 
   on the crossroads, and that it is often a good starting club for 
   people learning the ropes of fighting.  He could sure cut down on 
   the {BO}{BLU}({R}T{Y}I{G}C{BLU}){blu} chicken wings!

   hard at work on his latest charting of the oceans in the southwestern 
   part of Midgaard.  He looks up from his work to interest you in some of
   his most recent and accurate plottings.  He brags that his newest maps 
   even include latitude and longitude.  Something to brag about, eh?
