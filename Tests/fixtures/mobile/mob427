  {R}An assassin earns his living by killing others.  He is the ultimate
  spy, but must be evil in alignment regardless of his motivations for
  selecting his jobs.  Assassins cooperate in guilds, but do not take
  kindly to others trespassing on their turf.  Assassins are limited 
  in their progression, and must defeat previous leaders to reach the
  highest levels. {r}
