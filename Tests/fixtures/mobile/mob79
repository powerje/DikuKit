Gargoyle~
The gargoyle~
The gargoyle is sitting rather still.
~
A stone gargoyle sits on top of this fountain.  A jet of water
streams from his mouth.  The water is clear and pure as it
strikes the water in the fountain.  The wings on the gargoyles
are monstrous as well as the claws.  Whoever carved these beasts
was truly talented as the detail is beautiful.  They look almost
lifelike.  As though they could move in their stone prisons and
come and attack you.  Wait, one just moved.  No, that was
your imagination...Or was it??

enormous size and monstrous paws give you the feeling that

to a live animal is amazing.  It appears so lifelike to be stuffed.  You
sense movement in the back of the trophies, but you cannot pinpoint

It appears to be large enough to pick up a small dragon in its talons.
You wonder what kind of damage it did to the ground when it fell
from the sky.  You are glad that it is stuffed, although you have a
bad feeling about this room.  But the bird appears so lifelike, it looks
like it would fly off of its perch if it hadn't been nailed there.
Yes, nailed there!

woman scares you.

King Rethgif Redferne appears to be a very powerful man.  His strength
comes from the Greater God Naris, to whom he gives total devotion
and daily sacrifices to.  He believes that the more he sacrifices
the greater his strength will be.  Upon looking at you, he decides that
your equipment and life would make great sacrifices to increase his
strength.  "Come here, my young friend.  Come a little closer, I have a
gift for you my visitor."  As he draws his sword, you wonder just what
his gift is.

possess great strength and looks fit to rule this kingdom, if needed.
He appears to have the knowledge of experience of many battles
which you sense he has won.  He must have been training since he
was a child, and training hard.  His stature is that of a man several years
older than he.  He appears anxious to rule the kingdom, and
the look in his eyes makes it apparent that he will not allow you
to ruin his chances of becoming king of this realm.

This is the ghost of the king.  The journey into the next world was
halted for him because of his hatred for he who delivered him to
Death's door.  This hatred is placed upon you as he sees you
and recognizes you as the 'Deliverer'.  "Deliverance, that is
what I will use to slay you.  I will deliver you to Death and 
bargain to regain my life by exchanging it with yours."  The ghost
reaches into a ghostly void and pulls forth an enormous sword,
inscribed upon the blade is a single word, 'DELIVERANCE.'  Uh
oh, you have not made many friends here.

grief of her husband and son was not bad enough, but you also had to
kill her.  This was just too much for her to bear and it caused her to
remain on this world as a ghost.  She looks up with wet eyes and sees
you, the cause of it all.  Immediately, her mood goes from grief to hatred.
"You are the evil that has plagued my land and killed my husband
and son.  It is you who must pay, and pay dearly you will.  With
your life."  She swiftly moves in to attack before you have time to
react, she is upon you.

appearance is topped off with pointed black shoes.  Apparently these shoes
appear to be the source of his tremendous power for they radiate
magic.  He is a frail looking man, but it looks like the magic in him
is very strong and that he is not to be reckoned with.  He turns to you
and gives you an evil grin.  You interrupted his spell, now he must kill
you.

powerful as he was when he was alive.  He appears to be
angry that you ruined his chances at becoming the successor to the
throne.  This anger wells up in him and appears to create a red aura
around him.  This aura appears to make him more powerful as the
anger increases at you.  Why would he be angry at you?  Because
you killed his parents.  Because you ruined his chances at becoming
ruler of this land.  Or maybe it's because you are now in his room
and are about to loot through his stuff.  But whatever it is, this
anger appears to increase his strength as he draws a weapon
from his racks and moves towards you with a speed that is
impossible for the living.

any meddling adventurers that want to interrupt his spells.  It is
grotesque and frightening looking and it instills fear in your soul.
The disfigurement of its face is only the beginning of its horror.
The huge claws on the end of its hands and feet are complemented
by the enormous muscles in its chest and arms.  It looks like it
is pissed at the world for its disfigurement, and you are its next target.

dragon-like wings protruding from its back that appear to be
moving slightly in the wind.  The strength that this god appears
to possess must be immense.  You see the chest heaving, that
