  Gargamel lives in a run-down, though solidly built hovel with his
  mangy cat Azrael. Gargamel frequently denigrates, insults, and abuses
  Azrael (who typically returns Gargamel's abuse and displays amusement
  when Gargamel is humiliated), but he does in fact love him. In one
  episode of The Smurfs, Gargamel is depressed and saddened that Azrael
  had run away, and wishes he would come back. In another episode,
  Balthazar wants to kill a wildcat that Azrael befriended for his fur,
  and Gargamel begged him not to.

  Gargamel is a man who is perpetually stooped. His dark robe is

  he will sometimes feign friendship if there is something in it
  for him. He is also an abject coward, surrendering or fleeing
  upon the merest hint of personal risk or harm.

Standing before you is a giant that stands twenty feet tall.
It has a huge hairy chest as well as enormous muscles.  Giants of
all cultures formed during the War of the Clouds to fight off the
invasion of their society during the Seventy Year War against 
the Drow.  In a vain effort to eliminate the Drow the Giants
dug deep trenches into the Earth and hid inside them.  The drow
casted many spells to attempt to locate the Giants but to no
avail.  The Giants were not stupid however.  Their enormous
size did not due well in underground conditions so instead they
fleed into the Icen Region and formed Ice Walls to protect 
themselves from the Drow.
