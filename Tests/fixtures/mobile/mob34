A vampire is here hiding his face from your light source.

The guardian vampire looks quite EVIL.  Just by looking at him the hair on your

The priest~
A priest of all gods stands here solemnly speaking words of praise.
~
Obviously a goodly man, you feel somehow...closer to the gods just
by gazing upon this man.  Dressed in white, fine white hair, and
a soft slighty wrinkled face...this man has an sacred beauty.
You'd swear you saw a halo around his head.

A Mi-Go is walking around here.

Mi-Go, the Fungi from Yuggoth...it is a pinkish being about five feet long;
with a custaceous body bearing a vast pair of or membraneous wings and several
sets of articulate limbs, and with a sort of convuluted ellipsoid, covered with
multitudes of very small antennae, where a head would ordinarily be. ... These
beings sometimes walk on all their legs and sometimes on the hindmost pair only

The nightgaunt~
A nightgaunt is standing here
~
...shocking and uncouth black thing with smooth, oily, skin, unpleasant horns
that curve inward toward each other, bat wings whose beating make no sound,
ugly prehensile paws, and a barbed tail that lashes disquietingly.  And worst
of all, it makes absolutely no sound or speach and smiles not at all because
it has no face, only a suggestive blackness where a face ought to be...

The hunting horror~
The hunting horror is here in wait of an unwary traveler...
~
Serving Nyarlathotep, and now Roch'tar these beings are hunting for victims.
These beings resemble enormous ropy black serpents or worms possessing bat-
like or umbrella-like wings.  Their forms continually shift and change,
twitching and writhing, so it is hard to look at them.  They speak in great
harsh voices. A hunting horror is HUGE, normally around 40 feet long.

  Floating above the ground here and looking a bit dead, he whispers
softly into the air : "The forces of evil have unlocked my spirit as
                       well as one other. Free me from this misery
                       anyone that can hear. The peace of the grave

The mad etcher~
The mad etcher is sitting here babbling to himself and working on the wall
~
  Quite insane, the mad etcher has been here it seems for decades...
His hair is white; he babbles nonsense to himself; a layer of dust covers
his out of date clothing; and he seems to be working on the same portion of
the wall near the base...oh and he seems quite blind.

      He leers insanely at you ans says 'heh heh what can I do for you 
children?  Please dont mind my wife, she is always like that...hello
dear can you make some tea for our company? Oh good! Now sit right down
will you? would you like hot or cold tea? Yes the weather is....'

And on he babbles....
