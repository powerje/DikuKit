Sith Trooper~
{W}A sith trooper aims his rifle towards you.{b}
~

{W}  While the majority of the battalions now under Sith 
{W}  command are comprised of traitorous Republic forces, 
{W}  they are far from hodge-podges of disorganized troops. 
{W}  Only the strong are granted acceptance into the ranks 
{W}  of the Sith army; those judged too weak to be of use 
{W}  are put to an ignoble end. Traitors may be welcomed 
{W}  into the ranks, but a level of fear is quickly established 
{W}  to make certain they are not so quick to change sides 
{W}  again. {b}

{R}Citizen of Taris{b}~
{R}A simple citizen walks along the path, avoiding you.{b}
~

{R}  Though he makes it quite apparent he'd rather have

{R}  any fellow Tarisians that he will ensure their enjoyment
{R}  by not allowing you any further.{b}

{M}  Being the noble that she is, she mistakes you for hired help. 
{M}  Perhaps if you persuade her that you'll be bringing her drinks,
