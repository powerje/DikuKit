You see before you the largest dog you've ever seen! It stands four
and a half feet at the shoulder, you never thought you'd be face to
face with a canine.  Its coat is a deep greenish color, and it has 
brown spots scattered about. It has a strangly intelligent look
about it as it meets your gaze.

stalks that move quickly from side to side, looking for possible prey.

palace guardian~
The Palace Guardian~
The Guardian of Keena's palace stands here with constant vigilance.
~
This Guardian stands ten feet tall! Not over large muscles, but extremly
well defined, this guardian relies more on speed and skill over brute 
strength. Wearing a helmet, you cant make out many details of the face, 
but you can see a beautiful mane of dark brown hair extending below the
waist. Adorned in golden dragon scale armor, you can see little of what 
lies beneath, but as you look on at the motionless monolith, you cant
help but think...is that the delicate curve of a feminine leg, or the
slight spherical shape hinting at the breasts of a woman?
