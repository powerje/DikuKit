  Kephren is a kind older man with a large bald spot
  surrounded by long, bushy white hair and an equally
  white beard. He dons an earth toned gown and green
  shirt. His grey shoes are leather and cloth. A rope
  belt holds his attire together at the waist while a
  short cloak shelters his back from the cold which
  aches his bones.

  Kephren's rosy cheeks and friendly smile make him 
  quite approachable. Willingly, he answers any 
  question posed to him about the chronology of
  Krystonia as he is one of a select few to have 
  translated the scrolls left by the ancient ones.
  However, if he answers a question, he is bound to 
  ask a thousand about Krystonia's present.
