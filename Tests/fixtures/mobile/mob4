A woman with blaring {BO,M}pink{bo,b} hair glares at you from behind her protector.
~

   {BO,R}Behind the giant stands a rather attractive woman with a perfectly sculpted body and a long flowing {BO,M}pink{R} hair.  She is a small, dangerous looking woman who appears to be able to handle herself.  She also appears to be equally annoyed with her less-than intelligent partner as she is with you!{bo,r}

   {B}As your eyes pass over yet another replica of the Fred series, it seems to blur and fade.  You quickly snap your eyes back and where Fred once stood now stands Zartan, Master of disguise and illusion.  He cooly gazes at you with cocky arrogance, waiting for you to make your move.  With a start you realize you have been herded into this trap like a lamb to the slaughter.{b}

{C}A large man, with a long flowing cape eagerly awaits you {B}inside {BO,BLU}the {BO,M}ring.{bo,blu}
~

   The man before you, attired in a long flowing purple cape, cheesy moustaches and eyeglass appears rather like a geek whom you could laugh at.  And this is true, the mans intelligence is supremely above average, but then again he IS rather built and imposing.  Perhaps laughter is misplaced here and fear is more or less the reaction you should be feeling.

broca citizen zombie~
{R}Broca{r} citizen~
A citizen of {R}Broca Beach{r} brushes past you without a word.
~

   {B}A man, like any other, breezes by you with an air of indifference.  He offers no glance, no response, not even a glimmer of recognition.  In fact the closer you look the more you notice a strangeness about the people of {R}Broca Beach{B}.  There is something odd about the way they move, their strained motions and most of all the vacant look in their eyes that tells you all is not as it seems.  Its almost as though their minds have been sucked out and all thats left is this empty husk, this zombie of sorts.{b}

{B}You hear a faint rustling somewhere in the shadows.{b}
~

    {B}Out from the shadows steps a mercenary hired by the {BO,BLU}C{bo,blu}{R}O{BO,BLU}B{bo,blu}{R}R{BO,BLU}A{bo,blu}{B} terrorists, an elite ninja N{M}i{B}g{M}h{B}t{M} C{B}r{M}e{B}e{M}p{B}e{M}r{B}.  He is covered head-to-toe in a deep blood red and tan uniform with an array of weapons strapped in every conceivable, and some rather inconceivable places.  He wields a sword, with an oddly wavy blade, in one hand and light crossbow in the other.  As you stare in wonder at this strange foe, he strikes, quick as lightning.  Your heart races in a mix of stunned awe and fear at the inhumanly agile and stealthy foe.  One, two, three slashes rip into your chest before you snap out of your dumbstruck awe and get up the sense to put up your defenses.{B}
