Crab Sand~
{CY}A Sand Crab{cy}~
{CY}The small bubbles in the sand can only mean one thing...Sand Crabs{cy}
~
{CY}
  The curious bubbles in the sand, lead to further
  exploration. Digging deeper and deeper exposes
  this little guy. With little ability to function
  in the light, this harmless SAND CRAB immediately
  tries to dig back into the safety of the sand.

  This two foot tall, white bird with speckled feathers
  is somewhat of a menace to beach goers. It enjoys the
  hot sand and begs for food. Never feed a gull! He'll 
  just keep coming back for more.

Camlin~
{BL,BO}Camlin{bl,bo}~
{BL,BO}Everyone moves to the other side of the road as Camlin passes by.{bl,bo}
~
{BL,BO}
  No one really remembers Camlin's story, but 
  this man is not well liked. Camlin's shoulder
  length mop of peppered brown hair and scarred
  face add to the wild tales children tell about
  him. Some say he is an assassin or was in his
  day. Others say he was a great warrior turned
  bad. Most just walk on the other side of the
  road and get a bad taste in their mouths as 
  they pronounce his name... Camlin.

{Y}
  Gundobad has studied the arts of war and peace.
  He questions everything he comes accross until
  he is certain he's got it right. Though very humble,
  Gundobad knows what he knows and explains that 
  it isn't very much. Gundobad is a born leader
  and if ever anyone needs him, he will be there.
