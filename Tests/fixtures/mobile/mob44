The minor alien~
An Alien is crouched here, drooling acidic saliva.
~
Every fiber of your body screams, "RUN!!" as you look at this monstrous being.
You feel your confidence slipping away as you see this creature flex its steal
claws, and stretch it's metallic body.  Too late!  The beast has seen you, its
inner jaws sliding out and dripping acid onto the floor.

Mallin~
Mallin~
A weary warrior is here, weighted down by the ravages of time.
~
The man gives you a small grin and stands up a little straighter.
'I am Mallin,' he says, 'and I have been waiting for you a long time.'
He brushes his peppered hair back with a large, calloused hand, before
extending it to you.

alien warrior~
alien warrior~
A large alien, made of metallic alloy musclature, drops from above.
~
From the shadow emerges a great metallic beast, it's razor sharp adamantium
claws glowing in your artificial light.  Thick saliva drips from it's double-
jaws onto the floor.  Sizzing for a second, the alien's saliva dissappears as
it eats through the floor.
