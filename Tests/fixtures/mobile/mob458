{BLA,BO}  Garen's "zero tolerance" moral code is strictly upheld by

{BLA,BO}  Demacian troops may not make excuses, flee, or surrender by 
{BLA,BO}  example. Garen, the valiant warrior who bears the title 
{BLA,BO}  "the {b}{M}Might of Demacia{BLA,BO}", is the paradigm to which these leaders

{Y,BO}  Born to the prestigious Crownguards, the paragon family of

{Y,BO}  grew up as the familys only daughter, and she immediately 
{Y,BO}  took to the advanced education and lavish parties required 
{Y,BO}  of families as high profile as the Crownguards. As Lux matured, 
{Y,BO}  it became clear that she was extraordinarily gifted. She could 
{Y,BO}  play tricks that made people believe they had seen things that 
{Y,BO}  did not actually exist. She could also hide in plain sight. 
{Y,BO}  Somehow, she was able to reverse engineer arcane magical spells 
{Y,BO}  after seeing them cast only once. She was hailed as a prodigy, 
{Y,BO}  drawing the affections of the Demacian government, military, 
{Y,BO}  and citizens alike.{b}

minion warrior~
{G}A warrior minion{b}~
{G}Attempting to look intimidating, this minion slashes the air with his sword.{b}
~

{G}  This small creature is generally quite small. He seems to be
{G}  able to sustain himself a bit longer than a magic-using
{G}  minion, but his abilities are certainly lacking in a combative
{G}  sense.{b}

minion tank brawler~
{G}A brawler minion{g}~
{G}With two spiked clubs, this minion stomps down the lane.{b}
~

{G}  Fairly larger than the other minions, this particular one
{G}  seems a bit tougher. Small muscles are seen beneath the armor
{G}  he wears. Steel flashes on his skin and the two spiked clubs
{G}  he wields pummel his foes.{b}

minion magic~
{R}A magical minion{b}~
{R}Patrolling the path, this minion flings a spell right at you!{b}
~

{R}  Being of a bit stronger power than the green minions, this
{R}  creature could be seen as the purest minion quintessence of
{R}  a mage. His spells each are a different color, and the one
{R}  that splashes on you stings.{b}

minion warrior~
{R}A warrior minion{b}~
{R}This minion slashes violently in your direction!{b}
~

{R}  Small but sturdy, this average minion wields a sharpened
{R}  iron sword and some standard pieces of armor. Its sword
{R}  pokes at your belly... Ouch.{b}

{R}A brawler minion{b}~
{R}Two spiked clubs flail violently at your flesh!{b}
~

{R}  Larger than any other minion, this guy is an epitome for
{R}  intimidation. That is, if you red creatures about the size
{R}  of your leg with two clubs intimidating. Look out before he
{R}  clubs off one of your toes!{b}

amumu champion~
{C}Amumu, the {G}Sad {C}Mummy{b}~
{C}Endless tears stream from the wrapped mummy's face.{b}
~

{G}  All he remembers is that he woke up alone inside 
{C,BO}  a pyramid within the Shurima Desert. He was entwined 
{b}{G}  in mummy wrappings and he could not feel his heart 
{C,BO}  beat. Furthermore, he felt a deep sadness that he 
{b}{G}  could not entirely explain; he knew he missed his 
{C,BO}  parents, though he could not remember who they were. 
{b}{G}  Dropping to his knees, Amumu wept into his bandages.
{C,BO}  No matter what he did, it seemed he could never stop
{b}{G}  his tears or sadness. Eventually he stood up, 
{C,BO}  determined to wander the world to discover his past.{b}
