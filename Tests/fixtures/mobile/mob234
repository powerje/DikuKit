   {bold}{RED}Bragar {BOLD}{WHITE}is gaunt-faced and completely bald. His dark eyes, like

   makes your flesh creep. Although you desire to avoid him at all

   You find it almost impossible to look him in the eye, for the
   anonymous coloring seems to automatically divert your gaze
   elsewhere. What is worse, is that he is very aware of this, and you
   suspect that he uses it to deliberately unnerve people.

   looks  almost feminine, and his deep, luminous gray eyes have
   long sweeping dark lashes that many a maid would sell her soul
   for. If you were more mature and confident, you might  suspect
   him of being painfully shy, but as it is you find him cold and fey.

    It seems when Gods had made him, they had been in a hurry, and just
    picked up any features that lay to hand, with no thought for the result. 
    His body is a gangling, uncoordinated, too big for his frame - and that is
    saying a lot.  His chest is too narrow for his broad shoulders and long
    legs, and as for his face...It was a nightmare.  His nose is too long, and
    his ears stick out. His pointed chin looks out of balance with his broad
    forehead and heavy brows.  His eyes were a muddy gray-green and,
   despite his best efforts, his dark, stringy hair looks unkempt.  Men tend to
    look on him as a threat, and as for women - forget it! They wouldn't look
     twice at him. Given his appearance, it was difficult for him to make
    friends - yet friends he had, and it was all due to the greatness of his heart.
