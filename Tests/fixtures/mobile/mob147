obscene flower mob~
The Obscene Flower~
You see an obscene flower here performing x-rated actions!
~
   What the hell is this thing?  Somehow this pretty looking flower has come
to life, uprooted itself and is now performing all sorts of obscene acts!
It fingers itself, grabs a passing flower, and jump on its back to do the
bunga-bunga!  Its face turns to YOU and it leers horribly at you, filled
with mischevious desire....

The Unrepeatable Bug~
You see a horrific but rare unrepeatable bug wreaking havoc on the wiring!
~
Uh oh!  You finally see what's causing the whole mud to f*ck up,
and it's something NASTY!  Worse than a COMM member in a foul mood,
you see the rare but ghastly UNREPEATABLE BUG!  It laughs evilly
as it beats your brains out while continuing to insert more bugs
and absurd code into the mud.

Interesting... this tree seems to be alive.  You couldn't be sure, but the
fact that the tree is holding a saucer in one branch while sipping tea
with another branch while waving at you with yet another branch seems
to indicate that this tree is somehow alive.  However, this tree is so
friendly that it won't let you leave!  It wants you to have a chat with it.

only the whites shows and he staggers drunkenly around the room.  This is
one lazy bum who won't help out when the mud's going to hell!  He also
looks pretty sick and might vomit at any time.  From his breath, you decide
that you definitely don't want any of that vomit touching your skin...

A resistor jumps around happily and wags its rear as it snuggles up to
your leg.  You try to gently shove it away with your leg, but it won't
go away!  It clings to your leg like glue.  Ordinarily you wouldn't
mind, but those sharp legs of the resistor are digging extremely
painfully into your leg and it won't let you pass!

wall, turns to you, and sizzles softly at you.  You'd better think fast.

ignoring everyone, and babbling something about a monkey and a banana.
He also looks pretty sick too.  He must have a hang-over.  Watch out

bugs to ensure sales of updates."  The combination of this blantant
dishonesty and the stench rising from him churns your stomach.  Apparently,

lazy ass god~
The Lazy and Apathetic God~
You see a lazy god sitting here on his ass, ignoring pleas for help everywhere.
~
    Sheesh.... you've *finally* found a god!  But he is just sitting here
on his ass, doing absolutely nothing.  Meanwhile, you hear pleas for
help from mortals everywhere, but he seems to be either deaf or ignoring
everyone.  In fact, he ignores you as you walk up to him and instead
admires his manicured fingernails.  You see posters of COMM's all over
the place, and you can see distinct lip-marks on the COMM's butts on the
posters.  Ewwww gross.

MagiMaster~
An old man with glowing hands

You see a wrinkled old man, with sparks and fireballs crackling
between his hands.  He also seems to be surrounded in a
blue aura.  Oh no!  It's a master of magic, a MagiMaster!

rabid bunny death~
The Evil Rabid Bunny of Death from Hell~
You see a cute furry little bunny rabbit hopping around here.
~
Awwww... how cute!  A loveable looking white bunny with floppy
ears and a pink nose is hopping happily about here, without a
care in the world!  You just want to reach out and stroke its
fur.... until it stops, looks at you, and snarls fiercely, baring
its bloody razor-sharp fangs!  What the....?
