   {BOLD,MAGENTA}So New York  doesn't  offer the most  attractive ladies in {bold,magenta}
   {MAGENTA}the world,  however these  girls  are ready and willing to {bold,magenta}
   {BOLD,MAGENTA}give you  pleasure,  for the right amound of gold. Dressed {bold,magenta}
   {MAGENTA}in tight and sexy corsets, these  prostitutes make all  of{bold,magenta}
   {BOLD,MAGENTA}their  money  by   continually  soliciting  themselves  to {bold,magenta}
   {MAGENTA}citizens of the Five  Points. Occasionally, if a traveller{bold,magenta}
   {BOLD,MAGENTA}is lucky  enough, he will  be able to relieve  any  sexual{bold,magenta}
   {MAGENTA}tension that has been pent up by spending a night with one{bold,magenta}
   {BOLD,MAGENTA}of the  harlots. Your eyes begin to wander all  over  this{bold,magenta}
   {MAGENTA}lovely lass' body and you become entranced by her  prowess{bold,magenta}
   {BOLD,MAGENTA}and perfume.{bold,magenta}

{BLACK}A young boy is on the street corner, vehemently trying to sell newspapers.
~

   {BOLD,GREEN}This poor kid looks like  he has  been starved for  weeks. He is 
   as thin as a  rail and  small  smudges  of  {BOLD,BLACK}dirt{bold,black}{BOLD,GREEN} adorn his young
   and  innocent  face. It is common knowledge that boys around the 
   age of thirteen or so hit the street  corners attempting to make
   money for their families. Most try a life of crime, however this 
   kid  looks as if he's  out to  make  an honest  dollar. However, 
   looks can be deceiving, especially after you feel a hand in your
   pocket and notice the smile on the boy's face is unusually large.

{BO,YEL}A tiny, yet dangerous looking man, is creeping around the streets with a sneer painted across his face.
~

   {YELLOW}This character gives you an immediate and ultimate terrible  feeling when you are around him.
   His {CYAN}sneer{YELLOW} does not leave his face and it seems as if he's projecting it directly at you. The
   man is not too big in  stature, but has an intimidating  look to him. You  don't doubt for a 
   moment  that  he  could  do  some {BOLD,RED}serious  damage{bold,red}{YELLOW} to you. You notice him  casually  emptying
   the pockets  of  pedestrians as they pass by. You  even see some  notice that they have been
   robbed, but refuse to do anything about it once they see who was doing the pickpocketing.

~
{WHITE}
   The pale-faced albino Emperor of Melnibone stands before you.
   His Crimson eyes seem emblazoned with pain and hatred.  You see
   in his eyes that one way or another the pain that has been his life
   ends here, a pawn of the fates his path chosen for him ages ago. 
   The great hell forged blade of black moves in his hand and you
   hear the beginning of an ecstatic moan come from the sentient
   blade.  You know now the truth of the rumors, that Stormbringer is
   alive and drinks the souls of its victims.  You are in all likelihood
   next....
