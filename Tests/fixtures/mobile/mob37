the ghastly ghoul~
A ghastly ghoul is here.
~
It is a walking corpse with long fangs and long, sharp nails that most of
resemble claws.  Its eyes are a dark yellow colour and glare hungrily at you.

Orcus, Lord of Death~
Orcus, the Lord of Death~
Orcus, the Lord of Death is standing in front of YOU!
~
This is the high Lord. He decides if you will die or not!
His giant body is absolutely impressing. 15 feet high, this
black creature is standing in front of you. One slash of his
arms can kill you. And his red glowing eyes are staring in
YOUR direction. Oh my Lord! ... R.I.P.
