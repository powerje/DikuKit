  Do not let the shiny obsidian scales fool you!  This dragon
  is a master of acid, and acrid fumes pour out of its mouth
  as it looks you over with its grim eyes.
  
  Legend has it that the black dragon's scales have special
  magical properties to enhance the attack damage of anyone
  who holds one in battle...the problem is, of course, getting
  your hands on one.

  Although not the largest dragon, this is the renowned weapon
  master of the dragon clan.  He requires no armor as his sleek,
  silver interlocking scales are virtually impenetrable.

  there are a few pieces that will fit nicely into a humanoid
  hand.
