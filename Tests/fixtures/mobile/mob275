Nessel is a quarlsome old man who does not like change.  He rejected the

others.  He will soon learn that it is the weyrs that will demand, not
him.

fleets of Tillek and how the winds blow.  He's here because he does not
want the others to have anything he does not have. Keep a close watch on him.

{R,BO}F'Nor, {BLA}Rider of Brown Canth{R,BO}, is curled up upon the floor.{b}
~
 
   The heat was suffocating.  Tornadic winds seized them and slammed
them end over end.  F'nors mind was paralized by the holocaust they had
entered.  A thousand hot points burned the unprotected skin of F'nors
face.  He would never lose the scars on his cheek where particles had 
been forced into the bone.

{BLA,BO}Canth{b}~
{BLA,BO}Brown Canth is here, slowly recovering from his injuries.{b}
~
 
{BOLD}{BLACK}Brown{black} Canth looks up and slowly blinks one of the many lids of his eyes.
He is recovering slowly.  The time when it was thought he would not live
is now passed.  His broken forlegs are mending nicely.  New membrane is
growing slowly on his scorched wings.  He has the entire weyr hopping
to when he itches and wants to be oiled.  That's a lot of dragon to oil.

{BLU,BO}Brekke, {C}the sad{BLU}, waits here patiently.{b}
~
 
A scream was torn from a raw throat, a scream like a knife upon raw nerves.
Don't leave me alone, the cry in the night.  Of Anguish heart-striking,
of soul-killing fright.  Live for my living, or else I might die.  Don't
leave me alone, a world heard that cry.
