  shes seen decades of battle. Her claws are massive and stained with the blood of
  her enemies and it looks as if they could rip through any type of solid material,
  wether it be rock or even steel. The light reflecting off her bright blue scales
  give off a warm glow to the room.

  It looks like your average size sand crab, except for it's gigantic
  oversized claws! Which just by sizing them up, has got to be around
  the size of your entire body! At a stand still it has the ability to
  move it's claws with the littlest of ease, though while on the move,
  it's claws are dragged helplessly behind it's body, giving it a huge
  disadvantage on the fighting field.

  the tapestry! These beasts have been said to
  be harmless in nature, though.. if threatened,
  can be one of the most deadliest creatures
  known to man. Be careful not to upset them!

{C}Midas{c} {W}the {BO}{C}Elder{c}, {BO}{B}Keeper of{b} {Y}Threads{y}~
{M}An elderly dragon rests here watching over his glorious threads{m}.
~

This ancient dragon is the eldest of them all. His scales
seem old and fragile, yet his physique is of a powerful
middle aged dragon. Resting upon a throne made entirely of
golden thread, he watches over his Tapestry with a vengeful
eye. Suddenly you feel a swift claw slash across your shield
as you draw your sword and prepare for battle.
