{BOLD}{WHITE}Here stands one of the enchanted kingdoms best warriors, he
is down on one knee asking the king of what he wishes for him to do.
Like any loyal subject would do.  These warriors have been through
many battles and adventures, you can tell all this by the condition
of there weapons and armor.  Also by how well they take care of themselves
against the other knights.  Most knights dont mess with warriors, because
for one reason knight is the second step past warrior, and warriors
have to be almost 100% efficient of what they do and how they do it
before they ever earn the rank of knight in this kingdom.  Most the
knights these days slack off, so a warrior could be a knight's mistake
to fight.{white}{bold}
