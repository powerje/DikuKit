~
 
  Garlic's father had competed for the position of Earth
  guardian but he was stopped by Kami who discovered his
  evil intentions. Garlic Junior was granted immortality 
  by the Eternal Dragon Shenron after collecting Earth's
  seven Dragon Balls. But he is locked in the Dead Zone,
  a black void of his own creation. Interestingly, Garlic
  Junior is from the Makyo Star, and his power level is
  proportionate to the Makyo Star's distance. Thus when 
  the Makyo Star nears Garlic Junior, his power is 
  increased and he bursts forth from the Dead Zone to once
  again put Earth in peril.
