{BOL}{B}A Golden Two-headed Lion blends in with the surroundings.{b}
~

    This beast completely blends in with his surroundings as he lays upon
    the heaping pile of gold. His golden fur glimmers almost as if it were
    made of golden thread. He guards over his master loyally. As he opens
    his huge mouth and bellows a roar you start to feel weak in the knees.
    The lion then pounces at you riping the steel chain holding it down
    right out of the floor.

  This flightless dragon is a crafty and cowardly creature.  Her sly eyes show
that she is only playing the part of a hapless dragon.  Slowly you move toward
her and as she leaps across the room with great agility, you realize her act
really has thrown you off.  As her claws tear your armor to shreds you scamble
for your disarmed weapon hoping you did not make a fatal mistake.

  This ghastly undead creature noiselessly sneaks from room to room.  Saliva
dripping from their powerful jaws and the dark green liquid on the tips of
thier claws mark them as strong foes.  They have the feet and ears of a donkey,
and hair on most parts of their pale white body.  The ghuls seem to have a
natural hunch which along with their cold and clammy bodies only enhances
their horrific visage.

  This undead monster looks similar to the standard ghul except for the fact
that even in his hunched position he towers over you.  It has thick hair and 
bushy eyebrows which are dropping over its eyes.  You watch in disgust as the 
ghul devours the flesh off the corpse then breaks the bones in two then 
ravenously sucks the marrow out.  Then its hate filled eyes turn upon your
tasty morsel of a body.  Time to run for your lives and hopefully keep your
skin intact as well.

    The palace guard is truly a bold warrior and he is here to stop 
    you from going any farther. He appears happy to have a challenge 
    to break the boredom of watching his post. Unfortunately for you 
    he doesn't ask any questions, apparently hes going to kill you 
    then ask questions.

    One of the ugliest and hugest ogres you have ever seen is here
    peacefully snoring at a volume loud enough to wake the dead.
    Apparently he is unarmed but from what looks like magical trinkets
    and spell components convince you he is not helpless. You notice
    an unusual lamp clenched within his grasp. This is the fearsome
    Ogre Magi and you would be wise not to wake him and incur his wrath.

~

    A Desert Giant once etched upon the stones of the palace gates,
    has somehow come to life. The face of the giant is weathered and
    craggy and has multitudes of wrinkles. The appearance is enhanced
    by the dark hair and swarthy skin and most especially its blue eyes.
    Then as you step forward towards the gate, you peer up and notice
    that the seventeen foot tall giant is gazing down upon your and
    your party. Then in a voice which hasn't been spoken in ages,
    the giant says, "If thou wishes to pass, thou must get past me!"

~
  A massive genie with four arms and dark, polished skin wearing no clothes
except for a loincloth.  His top two arms are human, while the other two
are lion paws with ivory claws.  His red eyes sparkle with flame.  Above and
between his two eyes lies a third eye, which is green and resembles that of
a panther.  The third eye is also centered between two horns.  His hair is
as coarse as horsetails.  And two massive wings frame his back.  This
monstrous creature is here blocking your path and apparently hes not going
to be very easy.

    This Askarian Warrior like his companions looks pretty tough, dressed in 
    dirty clothes covering his fine suit of chain mail. He has a well crafted 
    scimitar slung at his side and he seems to be a very able fighter. Since 
    hes blocking your way to your objective maybe you better be nice to him.
