kruik trainer warrior elder~
{BLUE,BOLD}Kruik{blue,bold}~
{WHITE}A broad warrior stands lecturing words of wisdom to the trainees.
~

This old warrior has lived through many great battles. It is rumored it was he who
trained Bozo, the greatest warrior of this realm. As you walk across the room 
the trainer seems to follow you with his eyes, step for step. He wears a suit of 
traditional gladiator equipment, with a golden ring upon his finger. The ring
begins to glow brightly as you stare at it,...strange.

A dark figure steps out from the shadows and begins to speak.
~

Dressed in only a dusty rugged looking outfit this little dark elf does not 
appear to be much of a threat. However, you grow somewhat concerned when he holds
out his hand presenting to you the ring you had only moments ago been wearing
on your finger. What? He has not moved since you entered the room! Or has he?

   Patches of blood cover this small beast's dark fur.  Wherever a claw is not,
a fang seems to protrude from it's hideous body.  It would probably pose a huge  
threat if it wasn't the size of your shoe.  All you can think of, as you approach it
to engage in battle, is that it might make a good backscratcher... but your training
has told you to always be alert.
