{G}Shaggy{g}~
{W,BO}A man with a scraggly goatee and hair, wearing a dirty{w,bo} {G,BO}green shirt{g,bo} {W,BO}stands here{w,bo}
~

  He has unkempt hair, a scraggly gotee and a dirty green shirt.
  He's really tall, but as thin as a pole.  His annoying laugh
  is enough to make you want to lop his head off, but you better
  not, he might sell you something....or will he?

  This is your typical 1960's hippie who has long, unkempt hair
  and seems to be smoking some kind of pipe which smells really
  strange.  He wears glasses, bell-bottom pants, a skintight
  multi-colored t-shirt and a tattered jean vest.  Aren't you
  glad you're not back there?

~

  What a loser!  He wears a sparkling white glove, strange red
  jacket and tries to moonwalk, but usually just trips over
  his own shoelaces.  His greasy hair sticks to his forhead
  and his eyes are glazed over as if he's been doing something
  he shouldn't have been.

  Looks just like Scooby Doo from the cartoons!  He has a scruffy
  looking gotee on his chin, a long tail, and goofy eyes.  He
  almost always seems to be giggling or laughing about something,
  even if it's an old scare he went through with Shaggy.  He has
  short brown fur and looks like he'd be nice to pet.

{W,BO}A whisp of{w,bo} {BLACK,BO}smoke{black,bo} {W,BO}is here trying to choke the life out of you!{w,bo}
~

  A whisp of smoke from the pipe of the hippie seems to take
  a life of itself.  It takes no real form and reeks of all
  kinds of smoke.  It seems to be using this when it lunges 
  out from behind the hippie and attacks you!

  {W,BO}This man is only about five feet tall with greasy,
  but short, dark hari and large blue eyes.  The eyes
  appear much larger due to the coke-bottle glasses
  he wears.  He also wears a god awful plaid suit
  with a strange checkered tie and tennis shoes. He
  reeks of cheap smelling cologne and seems to snort
  when he laughs.{w,bo}

~

  Just a typical twelve-year old kid who decided that playing video
  games was much more exciting to him than anything real life has
  to offer.  He wears just a pair of loss jeans, dirty t-shirt, and
  grubby sneakers.  He looks at you, shrugs, and continues playing
  his game in silence.

~

  This person wears a tie-dyed shirt, tight-fitting bell bottom
  jeans and has unkempt hair.  This reject dropped out of school
  to 'better' himself and has instead gotten himself hooked on
  pot.  Just by his looks you can tell he has little money, and
  little care.  By his smell, you'd guess he needs a nice long,
  hot shower.
