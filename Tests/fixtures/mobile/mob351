     With all the children scurrying about and screaming, 
     what person wouldn't get a head ache. This poor 
     parent has a frown on their face and is sighing out 
     loud. Running after their kids is a lot to keep up 
     with, especially with all the other children romping 
     around. You can't help but feel sorry for them.

~
  
     Paying attention to detail and each individual 
     request of a customer, this guy is panicking 
     due to the supply and demands that he cannot 
     meet. The unsatisfied customers are constantly 
     giving him grief over the fact that he cannot 
     find what they want. As he offers you assistance, 
     you realize that this guy is very over worked and 
     way under paid! The story of our lives!

     You have heard of the term "Terrible Two's" right? 
     Well this toddler gives it a whole new meaning. 
     You can hear her screaming throughout the whole 
     store.  She is kicking and stomping her feet and 
     throwing her hands and arms in the air and all of 
     this is just because she isn't getting what she 
     wants. Well? Why don't you just give it to her?
