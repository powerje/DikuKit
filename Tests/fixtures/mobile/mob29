giant sloth~
A Giant Sloth~
A Giant Sloth hanging from a tree barely notices your presence..
~


  {G}{BOLD}The sloth is a tree-dwelling mammal related to the armadillo and 
  anteater. Their body is usually from 60-70 cm (24-27 inches) long and
  generally weigh about 10 pounds.  However, in this case, it is a _giant_
  sloth, so its about 3x the normal height and weight!!  The size is
  deceptive due to the thick fur which is rough and greenish due to a thin
  coating of algae which grows during wet seasons. The fur provides
  camouflage among the leaves and provides some buoyancy when the animal
  is in the water. Sloths are excellent swimmers and can stay underwater 
  for quite some time if threatened.{g}{bold}

A loyal {Y,BO}Monk{B}ey{b} stands here.
~


  {Y}Monkeys have often been associated with mischevious behavior, 
  cunning and sometimes malice. They can be clever or dirty. Since
  monkeys can appear to incessantly chatter, they represent the 
  distracted mind that needs to be focused through meditation and 
  other disciplines. When tamed the monkey is then capable of great 
  loyalty and intelligence.{y}

A loyal {Y}{BOLD}Tree {G}S{Y}n{W}a{G}k{Y}e{y}{bold} slithers around the area.
~


  {Y}The Tree Snake doesn't take well to handling, and it has the 
  dentition to inflict a serious bite. If taming and handling does 
  happen, beware of people passing by you, as the animal may be 
  tempted to strike. It does not eat well in captivity, and will 
  generally consume chicks or rodents. It can grow to well over six 
  feet in length, this snake is not to be considered as a pet by the 
  inexperienced handler. {y}

{Y}  The child before you is a happy one, not a care in the world.  Curiously  
  the naked child searches for new and amusing things to play with and
  hopefully not destroy.  Placing your items in the hands of these innocent
  children will surely cause harm upon them.{y}

{BL}A Puma{bl}~
A loyal {BL}Puma{bl} stands here.
~


  {Y}A lithe, slender animal, the puma has strong and very muscular 
  limbs. The neck is comparatively long and the body rather elongate. 
  They have relatively small heads with short faces. The dark ears 
  are rounded, and not tufted. Characteristically the puma's hind 
  legs are longer than the front. This difference, which elevates 
  the rump, is the greatest in the cats, and is believed to be an
  adaptation for jumping. A long heavy cylindrical tail is used as 
  a counterbalance.{y}
