   Cain Marko grew up with his step-brother Charles Xavier, and always

   Charles (Kurt felt guilty over having caused Brian Xavier's death). 
   In fact, one time when a fire broke out in Kurt's lab, he saved 
   Charles before he even thought about going in to the flames to rescue 
   Cain. When the boys were drafted to Korea, Cain and Charles stumbled on 
   an ancient temple. Lured by greed and thoughts of glory, Cain found a 
   red gem and picked it up. He became a human juggernaut. Protected by that 
   Crimson Gem of Cyttorak, Juggernaut is the unmovable force. His super-
   strength, combined with his total invulnerability make him nearly 
   unstoppable. His only weakness is psychic attacks, if his helmet is off.
