{CYAN}You feel the presence of a greater being here.{cyan}
~
{CYAN}
   You sense the presence of a being of considerable strength here.
   Uncertainty fills you ...  the room is empty, yet you know that you
   are not alone.  There is a smothering presence here that is
   overwhelming yet imperceptible.  It attempts to gain control and
   you feel a tremendous urge to resist its invasion of your mind.

{BOLD}{CYAN}A swirling vortex of primordial energy is here !{bold}{cyan}
~
{BOLD}{MAGENTA}
   A chaotic cloud of energy is here before you.  It obeys no laws. 
   You know that to defeat it you must simply bring forth all of the
   raw aggression of your being.  Should you attempt to defeat it with
   reason and planning, you are surely doomed.

{CYAN}A pillar of pure energy is here !{cyan}
~
{CYAN}
   There is a large pillar of glowing blue energy here.  As you move
   closer to it the energy transfers to you and your body begins to
   vibrate as it attempts to hold the massive amount of energy in a
   vessel that was never intended to hold nearly this much.  You had
   better destroy this thing before it burns you to a cinder !
