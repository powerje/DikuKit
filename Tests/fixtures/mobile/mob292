~
     An obvious victim of over drinking and too much partying, this 
clubber has seen better days. The looks in his eyes suggest he's very
willing to take on the entire world.. through those thick beer goggles
of his!! Regardless, one swift punch is probably gonna make him lose
his lunch, so watch out!!

Waiting patiently, a clubber stands here in line
~
Patiently standing here, this person is just ready for a good
time. Much like you, they have to navigate this crowd of people
before they can party it up. Unlike you, however, they seem like
they have more patience than you have right now. Standing here
chatting, and having a good time at it too, is enough for them
to pass the time.

     Having seen on too many toilets in his life, this janitor seems a
little crazy. His old age doesn't help much either, as his prime has come
and went. His eyes are distant and hollow, and he seems beyond reasoning.

~
     This guy really looks like he needs to use the bathroom and quick!
He's ever so pale, moaning and groaning while he holds his belly. His
colour is gone and he looks really sick. Even in his weakened condition,
he looks like he's going to put up quite the fight. He wants to use the
bathroom now and he's ready to prove it.

Dancing wildly, this clubber cares nothing for those around him or the
pain he causes others. He's wrapped up in his own little world, expecting 
everyone else to move out of his way. If you're not careful, he may end
up crashing your way as well.

A Polished cue ball sits here, innocently

Polished to perfection and remarkably smooth for such a highly

whole reality of the game. It just wants to be left alone most
of the time anyways.

One Ball~

Glaring you with its line, the one ball waits to be played
~
"It's lonely at the top" it quietly thinks to itself. Being the
first ball in the game, it means he spends most of his time in
the deep, dark pocket. Now that it's tasted freedom, however, it
won't go back there without a fight.

tricks that the one ball did.

Physically strong, the four ball waits for someone to challenge it
~
At his physical peak, it seems that very little can effect this
four ball. Strong, tough and agile, it shrugs off almost all sorts
of attacks. Its body ripples with muscles and it looks like it 
can fight for hours. A prime specimen! Now if something could be
done about its smarts.

Tired of hiding in the shadows of the nine ball for so long, the
six wants to make a name for itself. It won't let anything stop
it now! It's going to whatever it wants to do! It looks over at
you and lets out a full bodied laugh. For some reason, it doesn't
seem very threatened by you.

Luck has always been the name of the game with the seven ball. 
The ball glows with a radiance of self confidence, knowing full
well that its luck will save it. As you size up this opponent,
you can't help but think that you may be facing something else
beyond the ball itself. Maybe it does have lady luck in its
corner.

Hidden in mystery and shrouded in darkness, the eight ball seems
to work differently than the rest of the balls. Unusally shiney
and strangly smooth, its like it hasn't faced any wear and tear
at all. If anything, it still has its shinney coat. However, it
seems that it is hiding something under that dark shell of his.
The better question, though, is what..

Far too smart for its own good, it knows when the good needs to
get going. This good old nine ball has more wisdom and smarts
than all eight other balls combined. With this guy, you're not
going to get away with alot. It peers over at you and silently
begins its attack, knowing too well the future course of this
epic battle.

softly to himslef, as if this whole thing is a joke to him. He turns to

wearing anything. Scantily clothed, every guy stares, hoping for a peek.
She flashes a smile to the crowd and sways even more, shaking her stuff
and teasing the crowd with every turn, shake and flash. She knows that
every guy in the club wants her.. and even some of the women too..

Spinning the latest grooves, the DJ works hard at his art, breaking

a child's toy.  Mixing them together perfectly, he compiles what
seems to be the perfect jams for the rhythm generation. He breaks
his concentration for just a second to notice you standing there,
and then goes back to work, totally ignoring you. It may be a good
idea to leave him alone.. he doesn't seem like he wants to be 
bothered right now.

He comes to a stop, just before you, panting heavily from all the work that the DJ has 
given him to do. He glances up, noticing youre not even supposed to be there.  He 
begins his attack on you, then suddenly realises that he has 100 other chores to do.  
Running off, he pays almost no attention to you or what youve been doing.  Very funny  
people indeed..

They shake their sculpted bodies in front of the crowds, teasing them with their eyes and 
their seductive moves.  Sweat glistens ever so gently from their exposed flesh, 
evidence to this ever hard line of work.  You look at them, almost captivated by their 
dance, just before you realise they block your path.  The catwalk isnt large enough for 
everyone!  Obviously unwilling to move, focused completely on their work, they continue 
to dance without a care who you are and what you want.

You notice that this dancer isnt like the rest of them.  She dances with more sensuously 
and with far more passion, raising Go-go dancing to an art form.  She slowly points and 
you and motions for you to approach her, while at the same time, never breaking her 
stride.  You slowly stumble forward, as the cheers of the crowd give you the strength to 
keep going.  The closer you get, the sharper her smile becomes, drawing you even closer as
if it were a Black Widow luring its mate.  Suddenly, you realise that youve fallen in her 
trap, as she rakes her nails across your chest.  Be sure not to fall for her trap again, or
it may be more than your chest that shell sink her nails into.

brother tonight?!!, the MC intros the next song, as the DJ drops the beat.  Getting plain 
funky with the mic tonight, he turns to you, almost laughing at your very presence.  He

dj booth guard bouncer d.j.~
{BLACK}{BOLD}Th{bold}{CYAN}e DJ Boot{CYAN}{BOLD}h Boun{WHITE}cer{white}~
Making sure the crowd stays away from the DJ, the Bouncer stands vigilantly
~
Standing vigantly, it doesn't look like he's willing to let anyone
pass without a fight.  He glares down at you, obviously stating he
doesn't think you belong up here.  He uncrosses his arms and reveals
his clenched fists, ready for a fight. He then stands straight up
dwarfing both you and your commrads.  The shaky iron grate floor
trembles with every step he takes, above and beyond the normal tremors
from the bass of the music. Looks like you're in for quite a fight.
Lucky he can barely see through those dark tinted shades. You guess
that in an attempt to look even tougher, he thought those shades 
would help. What a moron.. dark shades in a club? Man, is he dense!

Born of choas, the unrepeatable bunny looks to create some mayhem
~
The computer, so it seems, has spit out another one of its crazed creations.
Although significantly easier than its brother, it still has sharp teeth
and wants to cause a little mayhem!

A Dust Bunny~
A dust bunny curls up in the corner of your pocket
~
This little cute fella just wants to be loved. Created out of the corner of
your deepest, darkest pockets, these little critters don't seem to want to go
away. And just like bunnies, it seems there's always more than you thought.

cockey taxi driver~
A cockey taxi driver~
You're nearly cut off by this asshole of a taxi driver
~
"It's lonely at the top" it quietly thinks to itself. Being the
first ball in the game, it means he spends most of his time in
the deep, dark pocket. Now that it's tasted freedom, however, it
won't go back there without a fight.
