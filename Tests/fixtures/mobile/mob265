The Mayor's Aunt~
The Mayor's Aunt is here waving a cane at you.
~
She must be going on 95! And still full of spunk apparently because she is 
waving her cane around in the air and yelling at all the young whippersnappers.
There is a big hairy wart growing out of her chin. Her skin is gray and wrinkled
beyond comprehenshion. Her back has a big hump on it and she walks with a limp.
