   poetry. William the Bloody's reign of terror went unchecked over the
   years, until a secret military organization implanted a chip in his

   You gaze upon a rather large wicket, standing
   vigilantly, albeit looking rather bored.  It gleams
   with a shine which rivals the sun itself. You jump
   back in surprise when it turns to look upon you. It
   only gives a blink, when it resumes it's perfectly
   still stance. It doesn't seem like it's going to harm
   anything, so it maybe a good idea to leave it alone.
   Besides, the Queen would be rather upset at you
   ruining a perfectly good game of croquette.
