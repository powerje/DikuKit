A Kobold Berserker~
A large cross-eyed Kobold is here muttering.

  muscles, scarred arms, and face tell you that he's seen many tough battles.
  It seems to start twitching violently as it notices you staring at him.

Kurg~
{BO,Y}A man sits behind his desk sorting gems.{bo,y}
~
  
  
  {BO,Y}Evidently a human of great wealth, Kurg is wearing an expensive silk suit of
  varied colors.  A pocket watch with a gold chain is tucked into one pocket,
  and multi-colored gems glitter from the rings he wears.  Oddly enough, Kurg's
  legs swing back and forth some distance from the floor, his seated position
  disguising his short stature.  It is suspected there is some amount of 
  dwarven blood in his family history{bo,y}
